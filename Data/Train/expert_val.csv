0,the-princess-bride-movie,Dave Kehr,75,"The Princess Bride wants to be sweet and warm, but it doesn't want to take the chance of seeming uncool -- and that is an attitude far, far removed from innocence. [9 Oct 1987]"
1,what-alice-found-movie,Frank Scheck,70,"There's a refreshing frankness to the film's treatment of its sordid subject matter that more than compensates for its technical limitations. The three performers inhabit their roles with, yes, an emotional truth that is bracing. This is particularly true of Ivey."
2,the-man-from-uncle-movie,Josh Kupecki,30,"The chemistry between the leads is nonexistent. Cavill unsuccessfully tries to channel Cary Grant, while Hammer’s Kuryakin has so much inner conflict, it becomes a joke that isn’t funny. "
3,words-and-pictures-movie,Jeff Baker,67,"Much of Words and Pictures is second-rate. A subplot involving a sexual harassment case is clumsily handled and a talented supporting cast, particularly Bruce Davison and Amy Brenneman, is underused."
4,in-america-movie,Peter Travers,75,An emotional wipeout. 
5,offside-movie,Janice Page,88,As funny as it is sharp.
6,below-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,"It just never began to work for me, and the sub story behind the ghost story is far more interesting than the ghost story in front of the sub story."
7,basic-instinct-2-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"At this point, there are inflatable toys that are livelier than Stone, but how can you tell the difference? Basic Instinct 2 is not an erotic thriller. It's taxidermy."
8,melancholia-movie,Rene Rodriguez,100,Leave it to von Trier to conceive an intergalactic sci-fi metaphor for a psychological disorder – and then make it work so astonishingly well. 
9,frozen-2013-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,Frozen is a squarely enchanting fairy tale that shows you how the definition of what's fresh in animation can shift. 
10,notorious-cho-movie,Robert K. Elder,75,Establishes the comedian as just that: notorious -- in all the best ways outlaw comedy can make you a star.
11,how-to-live-forever-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,70,How To Live Forever is less about how to delay or defeat death than a film about what gives life meaning.
12,solo-a-star-wars-story-movie,Kate Erbland,83,"For now, he’s a lone gun, but “Solo” ably lays out how and why that might change. We may know where he ends up, but for now, we can’t wait to see where he goes next."
13,light-sleeper-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,"Light Sleeper represents Schrader at his best, giving us a character we've become familiar with over the years and Schrader's intimate mastery of our fascination with decadence, loss and redemption."
14,sex-tape-movie,Courtney Shea,12,"The most important question is one that should be answered before setting foot in the theatre, and it is this: How badly do you want to see Cameron Diaz’s butt? If your answer is so very badly, or even pretty darn bad, then by all means, buy a ticket."
15,club-dread-movie,Ty Burr,38,A bumptious splatter farce that manages to improve from awful to moderately engaging as its cast is winnowed down to the five guys themselves. 
16,hector-and-the-search-for-happiness-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,30,Not even this sprightly cast can buck the privileged sense of entitlement that bedevils this movie. Don’t count on the impish humor that Simon Pegg has unleashed so successfully in other movies to save the day. 
17,i-dont-want-to-sleep-alone-movie,Scott Tobias,67,The film ends so beautifully that it's easy to forgive the dead passages that preceded it and hope it carries over into his next movie.
18,gimme-shelter-2014-movie,Keith Phipps,30,"Though light on drama, Apple’s scenes at the shelter are easily the best part of the film, among the few moments when Gimme Shelter decides to show the effect of faith and charity rather than simply preach it."
19,stealing-harvard-movie,Kevin Thomas,10,"It's so bad that you have to wonder whether Tom Green was looking for a project to match last year's ""Freddy Got Fingered"" --  Green didn't direct this turkey, but it surely is a contender for the bottom of the barrel award for 2002."
20,season-of-the-witch-2011-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,30,"Off the top of my head, I'm guessing that Season of the Witch claims a place in the top five all-time bizarre and pointless homages to art cinema."
21,dumb-and-dumberer-when-harry-met-lloyd-movie,Mark Caro,12,"So excruciatingly awful, the word ""dumb"" could sue for slander."
22,taking-sides-movie,David Sterritt,75,"Ronald Harwood's screenplay, based on his stage play, brings an impressive range of moral and political issues into play. The acting is also strong."
23,me-and-orson-welles-movie,Steven Rea,88,Linklater's film adaptation succeeds in bringing the flamboyant Welles to life.
24,what-richard-did-movie,Helen O'Hara,80,"A tough, impactful film that offers a sometimes uncomfortable but always gripping examination of cause and effect."
25,trixie-movie,Richard Corliss,10,"If this retro crime comedy had been a Broadway play, it would have closed out of town."
26,glass-chin-movie,Ernest Hardy,70,"Writer-director Noah Buschel's script is peppered with both offbeat humor and philosophical debates that circle back to what is, at heart, a class critique that skewers everything from the art world to the bougie dreams of the common man."
27,the-oranges-movie,Chris Cabin,0,"As much as the dialogue in the film voices an attitude of self-liberation and champions the positives of severing accepted social constraints, it seems to be constantly taking one step forward and two steps back."
28,beautiful-people-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"Often grim, but never nihilistic: Even at its darkest, Dizdar gives the movie an optimistic bounce. The movie is often shockingly funny, too."
29,the-social-network-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"Smartly written by Aaron Sorkin, directed to within an inch of its life by David Fincher and anchored by a perfectly pitched performance by Jesse Eisenberg, The Social Network is a barn-burner of a tale that unfolds at a splendid clip."
30,things-change-movie,Gene Siskel,88,"The film is mostly light and funny, but it also has a wistful ending that lingers in the mind. Both lead actors are sensational. [21 Oct 1988, p.A]"
31,brain-donors-movie,Staff [Not Credited],10,"The title Brain Donors sounds like a horror film and for those expecting a comedy, it is."
32,star-wars-episode-v---the-empire-strikes-back-movie,Peter Stack,100,"The balance between action and mysticism in The Empire Strikes Back provides fascinating energy. It's as if the kids are given one set of delights, the bravado of battles and elaborate warships zooming through exotic space, and adults are given another, a layered explanation of what it all means in the grand scheme of things. [Special Edition]"
33,gullivers-travels-movie,Nathan Rabin,16,"With deadening predictability, the filmmakers have reduced a definitive satire about the flaws and foibles of human nature into family-friendly sub-Disney pabulum about an affable slacker who finally musters up the courage to ask a pretty girl at work for a date."
34,it-follows-movie,Tim Robey,100,"Despite borrowing cleverly from the best, It Follows still manages to feel like no other example in recent years - tender, remarkably ingenious and scalp-pricklingly scary."
35,i-tonya-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,88,"Funny when it wants to be, poignant when it needs to be, and surprisingly effective in harnessing these deeper themes to a character who might otherwise be dismissed as a lightweight laughingstock."
36,south-of-the-border-movie,Karina Longworth,0,"South of the Border's subjects are masters at cooking bullshit, and Stone just eats it up."
37,detroit-rock-city-movie,Kenneth Turan,10,"This aggressively stupid film is merely business as usual, a compendium of all the current obsessions and fixations that make so many of these films such unhappy experiences."
38,place-vendome-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"This complex, sophisticated and increasingly suspenseful tale of love and betrayal, intrigue and redemption, is as elegant as its star and its settings."
39,kung-fu-panda-movie,Richard Corliss,90,The new picture provides a master coursed in cunning visual art and ultra-satisfying entertainment.
40,my-babys-daddy-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,20,Every bit as pathetic and unfunny as it looks.
41,furry-vengeance-movie,Mike Hale,0,Furry Vengeance is unbearable.
42,win-it-all-movie,Eric Kohn,83,"By making a satisfactory crowdpleaser that doesn’t overextend itself, Swanberg has delivered his most traditional movie to date — and for this prolific filmmaker, who spent ages defying conventions, that’s nothing short of a radical step forward."
43,something-borrowed-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"Bonds are tested and feelings hurt, but who really cares? The story takes predictable turns, embraces clichés and dodges all humor."
44,twisted-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"So utterly devoid of suspense, energy or credibility it should have been shipped straight to the remainder bin at Blockbuster."
45,indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,67,Harrison Ford? Terrific -- and re-energized.
46,breathe-in-movie,Rodrigo Perez,83,"Intimate, expressive, agonizing and beautifully rendered."
47,the-lesser-blessed-movie,Betsy Sharkey,70,"Pensively shot, painfully and poetically told."
48,brothers-keeper-movie,Peter Stack,100,"Brother's Keeper is a thoroughly engaging examination of the whole curious affair by two New York City-based film makers, Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, who document with a distinctive underlying humor and a feeling for contrasts between urban and rural America. Sometimes that contrast is touching, sometimes painfully hilarious, and often a little gloomy as the film delves into the lives of the surviving brothers to reveal a community with genuinely humane values, but one ripe for exploitation by the big city media. [16 Oct 1992, p.C4]"
49,raiders!-the-story-of-the-greatest-fan-film-ever-made-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"Imagine “Moby-Dick” rewritten in crayon, and you’ll get the idea."
50,shoot-em-up-movie,Dana Stevens,0,"Owen, Giamatti, and Bellucci--all fine actors at the peak of hireability--must have been coming off a collective coke bender when they agreed to be in this murky, straight-to-video-looking piece of crud."
51,phantom-thread-movie,Dana Stevens,90,This devilishly funny and luxuriantly sensuous film is so successful as entertainment that it’s hard to stop and notice the extreme degree of craft that went into its construction. 
52,slc-punk!-movie,Ken Fox,30,"Very possibly the most ruthlessly irritating comedy since the dreaded ""S.F.W."" attempted to put its finger on the pulse of young America, and that's saying something."
53,she-hate-me-movie,Anthony Lane,20,"The mélange of plots, subplots, reveries, gags, cartoons, dirty bits, and hissy fits points to a work that is structurally modelled less on the classic narratives of cinema than on, say, a portion of Russian salad."
54,poseidon-movie,Jessica Letkemann,38,"Isn't quite self-aware enough to be really funny, and certainly isn't serious or genuinely exciting enough to be thrilling because of it's action."
55,the-brave-one-movie,Rene Rodriguez,63,"As far as its plot mechanics go, The Brave One belongs to the hallowed (if less-than-respectable) genre of exploitative revenge pictures."
56,mumford-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"A feeling movie, a mood movie, an evocation of the kind of interaction we sometimes hunger for."
57,sahara-movie,Stephen Hunter,20,"Sahara is a mediocrity wrapped inside a banality, toasted in a nice, fresh cliche."
58,aint-them-bodies-saints-movie,Christy Lemire,88,Ain't Them Bodies Saints is a film that will reward you for seeking it out. 
59,penelope-movie,John Anderson,70,Anyone willing to tolerate the tortured premise of the story will be paid off handsomely by several winning performances and a moral that makes most of the absurdity worthwhile.
60,end-of-days-movie,David Sterritt,25,"Too bad (Arnold) can't save the movie from it's superstitious clap-trap, sadistic violence, and sheer silliness."
61,touch-of-evil-movie,Peter Bradshaw,100,Brilliant.
62,the-november-man-movie,Roger Moore,38,"A humorless, muddled, bloody and generally unpleasant thriller."
63,the-cat-in-the-hat-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"The ongoing cinematic desecration of Dr. Seuss' legacy continues with The Cat In The Hat, a clattering abomination that makes it depressingly likely that an entire generation of reading-averse children will know The Cat In The Hat as that obnoxious character Mike Myers played in that horrible movie."
64,monsoon-wedding-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"Nair's movie, far from being paste, is a string of small, exquisite gems."
65,what-time-is-it-over-there-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,100,"Tsai builds this shimmering story with deft, deadpan wit and a warm, understated love of the absurd, both in life and afterlife."
66,i-am-sam-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"In one of the year's most woefully manipulative and oppressively pandering offerings: I Am Sam, a dolled-up TV movie-of-the-week masquerading as profound cinema."
67,hugo-cabret-movie,David Denby,100,Hugo is superbly playful.
68,green-lantern-movie,Rex Reed,25,"Even as a prime example of rotten summer silliness, this is a paralyzing experience."
69,the-manhattan-project-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"A clever, funny and very skillful thriller about how a kid builds his own atomic bomb. This isn't really a teenage movie at all, it's a thriller. And it's one of those thrillers that stays as close as possible to the everyday lives of convincing people, so that the movie's frightening aspects are convincing."
70,the-brothers-grimm-movie,William Arnold,75,"It's a barrage of visual stimulation so excessive that it's hard to sort it all out. But it's often funny, its texture can be breathtaking and its pleasures likely will grow with repeated viewings."
71,staying-vertical-movie,Allan Hunter,70,"Exploring a bewildering range of issues from ideas of masculinity to assisted suicide and the fraying of societal ties, Staying Vertical is wildly eccentric, darkly comic and filled with you-don’t-see-that-often moments which are liable to render it an acquired taste."
72,cosmopolis-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,"Cosmopolis is frustrating, funny, thought-provoking, weird, maddening, worthwhile. It isn't a great movie. Sometimes it's not a good one. Sometimes it is. Ultimately, it is one worth working through, a valuable exercise if you're willing to make the effort."
73,red-dawn-movie,Elise Nakhnikian,12,It feeds the warrior fantasies of adolescent boys with a testosterone-heavy tale of a war free of moral complications.
74,the-we-and-the-i-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"Fake documentaries annoy me — why not put in the effort and deliver the real thing? — and this one is not only aimless and stiff, it also rings false."
75,neruda-movie,Roger Moore,75,"Gnecco, a Chilean comic actor well-known all over Latin America for assorted TV series, smirks and recites and plays Neruda as the legend he was and the role of a lifetime he’s become."
76,i-am-movie,Mark Jenkins,38,"While I Am has its boogeymen - especially the rich, the racist and the ultra-competitive - Shadyac implicates himself whenever possible. "
77,melancholia-movie,Peter Debruge,100,"For all the tyrannical disdain he's shown other filmmakers over the years, von Trier once again demonstrates a mastery of classical technique, extracting incredibly strong performances from his cast while serving up a sturdy blend of fly-on-the-wall naturalism and jaw-dropping visual effects."
78,i-shot-andy-warhol-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,As riveting as its title.
79,two-ninas-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,Should have gone straight to video.  It'll be there soon enough.
80,the-baytown-outlaws-movie,Rex Reed,0,The resulting mayhem and slaughter is vile and disgusting.
81,intruders-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"Hollowface, like Intruders (which ought to be just the singular ""Intruder,"" as Hollowface works solo), is all about empty scares. Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does include perhaps the most half-hearted exorcism ever filmed, which only seems fitting."
82,greedy-guts-movie,Ella Taylor,90,Magnificently twisted black comedy.
83,3000-miles-to-graceland-movie,Richard Schickel,10,"Courteney Cox is good as a sexy, hard-pressed single mom, but she alone can't redeem the prevailing stupidity."
84,dont-say-a-word-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,"A miler trying to run a marathon, a fair middleweight idea trying to deliver heavyweight thrills."
85,xxx-return-of-xander-cage-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,12,"I should put in for worker’s comp for the extensive injuries I sustained watching the insulting, abysmal 3-D action thriller xXx: Return of Xander Cage, which  left me deeply traumatized and suffering from injuries to my eardrums, my eyes, my mind, my soul, my aesthetic sensibility, and my sense of decency."
86,like-someone-in-love-movie,Leah Churner,89,"The characters’ painful inability to connect only endears them to us, and somehow the film seems, like any human object of our affection might, more vivid and more knowable in its absence."
87,american-beauty-movie,Mike Clark,100,"A singular accomplishment so specifically keyed to Spacey's talents that it mandates going out on a limb to say it contains the performance that will ultimately be regarded as ""the one."""
88,encino-man-movie,Michael Snyder,25,"Encino Man is so puerile and sophomoric that, by comparison, ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' is ''Our Town,'' and ''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'' is ''Gulliver's Travels.'' For that matter, Pauly Shore makes Wayne and Garth, the two cable TV rec-room rockers of ''Wayne's World'' fame, seem like they belong at the Algonquin Hotel round table. [22 May 1992, p.D3]"
89,the-art-of-getting-by-movie,Nick Schager,12,"If not for its lack of self-awareness, The Art of Getting By would seem to be a spoof of ennui-inflicted teen dramas, because how else to explain the fact that Gavin Wiesen's debut is comprised of only clichés of clichés? "
90,white-house-down-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"White House Down is amply endowed with enough tension, humor, and calamitous action to ensure it a solid berth in the summer box-office sweepstakes. Channing Tatum comes into his own as a leading man in this picture, proving himself as a beefy yet agile action star and not just the pure beefcake of ""Magic Mike."""
91,emperor-movie,Mike Scott,20,"There's really nothing definitive about Emperor. Or memorable, for that matter."
92,the-loss-of-sexual-innocence-movie,Sandra Contreras,38,"Aggressively non-linear and heavy on the visual flair, Mike Figgis' allegorical voyage through the mind of a filmmaker alternates between the tawdry, fake sophistication of fancy perfume commercials and an unholy regurgitation of the worst excesses of European art cinema."
93,no-good-deed-2014-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,No Good Deed is an example of the worst kind of exploitative thriller — and it’s being released during the worst possible week.
94,letters-to-juliet-movie,Ella Taylor,25,"A witless ninny of a movie about Italy, romantic disillusion, Shakespeare, history, more Italy and getting to ""yes"" in love and intimacy."
95,the-art-of-the-steal-movie,Pam Grady,70,"The film can be dry and a little repetitive. For all of that, it still manages to generate a surprising measure of suspense and it produces outrage in abundance."
96,lone-survivor-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,"What’s missing here is something, or rather, someone, to care about."
97,pootie-tang-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,One bad movie -- in the original sense of the word.
98,the-loss-of-sexual-innocence-movie,Dennis Lim,10,"The film isn't short on ideas, it's just that those ideas are dumbfoundingly pretentious and trite."
99,barfly-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,37,The first four letters say it all. 
100,drop-dead-gorgeous-movie,J. Hoberman,10,"Even sillier than it is cynical, Drop Dead Gorgeous is a tiresome tale."
101,crossroads-movie,James Berardinelli,25,"In a way, it's probably unfair to blame director Tamra Davis exclusively for this debacle. After all, she's toiling in the shadow of a would-be multi-media superstar, making her essentially a hired gun."
102,the-citizen-movie,Roger Moore,38,"By the time we reach the third act, which is where the trial we’ve been teased plays out (at great, boring length), The Citizen has exhausted its supply of immigration cliches and our patience."
103,city-of-god-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,100,A marvelous achievement that refuses to avert its gaze from the poetry and the insane savagery of the hopeless.
104,little-men-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"Any film with Jennifer Ehle, perfect as the tightly wound but loving therapist, tends to be worth seeing in the first place."
105,the-babadook-movie,A.A. Dowd ,91,"Believe it or not, though, the real horror of this superb Aussie monster movie has almost nothing to do with the title fiend and everything to do with the unspoken, unspeakable impulses he represents. Remove the Babadook from The Babadook, in other words, and something plenty terrifying remains."
106,pipe-dream-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"The film satirizes, and celebrates, an idea pivotal to both Hollywood and love: that in a world of impostors, the pretender with the most conviction can become exactly what he pretends to be."
107,fruitvale-station-movie,Rex Reed,75,"Fruitvale Station lacks the same global impact as Milk, but it’s still a harrowing film worth seeing and honoring for boldness and insight. It’s one of the most sobering must-see movies of the summer."
108,what-planet-are-you-from-movie,David Ansen,10,"The combination of Shandling's button-down TV sensibility and Nichols's good taste produces a film whose tone is out of sync with the simple, ribald conceit and is only mildly amusing at best."
109,happily-never-after-movie,Gregory Kirschling,16,"Stuffed with stock characters -- the vain prince, the critter sidekicks -- who adamantly stay stock."
110,the-color-of-paradise-movie,Carrie Rickey,100,"The film's climax involves a father and son reunion that is tense, tragic and, finally, as transcendent as Mohammad himself."
111,halloween-iii-season-of-the-witch-movie,Bill Cosford,0,"There's a delightfully promising premise behind Halloween III -- something's wrong with the kids' masks -- but somehow Wallace gets sidetracked, and the movie wanders away. [30 Oct 1982, p.D5]"
112,s21-the-khmer-rouge-death-machine-movie,Nathan Rabin,70,"A harrowing, unblinking look at the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge, the genocidal regime that by some accounts killed off more than a quarter of Cambodia's population between 1975 and 1979."
113,new-best-friend-movie,Robert Wilonsky,0,Seems to exist solely to prove there is something beneath the bottom of the barrel.
114,the-last-airbender-movie,Peter Debruge,20,"This is all enormously disappointing, of course, since the best we could hope for from a live-action ""Avatar"" adaptation is the mind-blowing equivalent of our first encounters with wire-fu, rather than this cartoony nonsense."
115,racer-and-the-jailbird-movie,Jessica Kiang,83,"One of the most undersung and most potent pleasures of genre cinema is the excuse it has given us, time and again, to watch attractive people fall in love with each other, and if you’re in a romantic frame of mind, Racer and the Jailbird delivers so wholly on that front that it goes a fair way toward compensating for the film’s deficiencies elsewhere."
116,spider-man-3-movie,Richard Corliss,80,"Where can mass-moviegoers find release for their tenderer feelings? Only at dozens of inspirational sports movies, where guys (on screen and in the audience) get to cry and cheer and win. And, this weekend, at Spider-Man 3."
117,upintheair-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"A smart, alert, supremely entertaining movie."
118,5-days-of-war-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"Harlin even makes poor Kilmer go running about. Just like that image, ""5 Days"" is embarrassingly clumsy."
119,ballistic-ecks-vs-sever-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"The movie is a chaotic mess, overloaded with special effects and explosions, light on continuity, sanity and coherence."
120,automata-movie,Odie Henderson,38,"Science fiction is often used in allegorical fashion. It may not be fair to judge Automata by this gauge, but the film is so deathly somber and heavy-handed that I can only assume director Gabe Ibáñez wanted to tell us Something Important. "
121,flash-of-genius-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,70,"That movie is not half bad, either. The trial, by comparison, will feel familiar to anyone who has ever watched any David take on any corporate Goliath before a court of law (""Erin Brockovich,"" ""A Civil Action,"" etc., etc.)."
122,justice-league-movie,Richard Lawson,10,"The film is, plainly stated, terrible, and I’m sorry that everyone wasted their time and money making it—and that people are being asked to waste their time and money seeing it. I hate to be so blunt, but it simply must be said this time."
123,somewhere-in-time-movie,Jay Scott,12,"The manner in which the writer, Richard Matheson, and Jeannot Szwarc, in his glory days the director of Jaws II, conspire to tell the story should not only render the audience tearless, but speechless as well. [11 Oct 1980, p.E7]"
124,the-original-kings-of-comedy-movie,Shawn Levy,75,"Racy, obscene, spirited and infectious."
125,the-kid-i-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,THE mesmerizingly awful The Kid & I is a historic first: a comedy about the making of a vanity production that is ITSELF a vanity production.
126,the-nanny-diaries-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"A comedic sinkhole, a dramatic tundra."
127,kill-bill-vol-2-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,100,"There's no denying that when it comes to communicating a certain delirious romanticism of character shaped by thousands of hours spent sitting in the dark, the artist who made this showpiece is a master."
128,gnomeo-and-juliet-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"Novelty alone does not a good idea make, and in the case of Gnomeo and Juliet, it's rather a disturbing, even fetishy one. "
129,get-out-movie,Jordon Hoffman,80,"It's very funny at times, but it isn't a comedy. It is that very rare of beasts: a new and original motion picture."
130,a-bronx-tale-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"A Bronx Tale is a very funny movie sometimes, and very touching at other times. It is filled with life and colorful characters and great lines of dialogue, and De Niro, in his debut as a director, finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears. What's important about the film is that it's about values."
131,how-to-be-single-movie,James Berardinelli,25,"A horrifically bad romantic comedy that serves as a celebration of entitlement, consumerism, and shallow behavior. "
132,20-dates-movie,Roger Ebert,12,The film has the obnoxious tone of a boring home movie narrated by a guy shouting in your ear.
133,extract-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"White trash meets white collar in Extract, Mike Judge's workplace comedy -- which contains more reality than the last five documentaries I've seen."
134,from-paris-with-love-movie,Rex Reed,0,"We all know how rotten today’s movies can be, but even at the bottom of the slag pit, you won’t find a load of garbage any smellier than From Paris With Love."
135,topsy-turvy-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,100,A masterful film about the magic of performance and the foibles of the artists behind it.
136,bruno-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Here’s the bad news: Brüno is no ""Borat."" Here’s the worse news: Brüno crosses the line, like a besotted sprinter, from hilariously to genuinely awful."
137,mishima-a-life-in-four-chapters-movie,David Ansen,70,"This handsomely shot movie, with its throbbing Philip Glass score, has a kind of perverse integrity; its mixture of the art house and the hothouse is pure Schrader. I'm not sure whom this movie is made for, but you've got to admire the chutzpah of the man who got it made. [23 Sep 1985, p.68]"
138,the-ballad-of-ramblin-jack-movie,Roger Ebert,75,Hovers intriguingly between homage and revenge.
139,the-company-men-movie,Noel Murray,75,"The cast doesn't treat The Company Men like a slideshow. They take something overly schematic and imbue it with real anxiety, shame, and humility."
140,the-in-crowd-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,0,"Summer's most shameless piece of trash since ""Wild Things."""
141,fahrenheit-911-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"The documentary's scathing attack on the war in Iraq and George W. Bush's presidency is informative, provocative, frightening, compelling, funny, manipulative and, most of all, entertaining. "
142,burnt-offerings-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"Burnt Offerings is a mystery, all right. What's mysterious is that the filmmakers were able to sell such a weary collection of ancient cliches for cold hard cash. "
143,slackers-movie,Stephen Holden,10,So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun.
144,wonderstruck-movie,David Rooney,100,"Alive with the magic of pictures and the mysteries of silence, this is an uncommonly grownup film about children, communication, connection and memory."
145,the-hitmans-bodyguard-movie,Robbie Collin,20,"The Hitman’s Bodyguard simply doesn’t put in the effort, with the result that almost every aspect of the film proves wildly irritating, from its central odd couple to the dubious green-screen work that regularly has them pulling nonchalant faces in front of exploding buildings."
146,hush-movie,Maitland McDonagh,38,"This trashy, overwrought thriller gets itself worked up into a fine, sleazy lather that recalls the matricidal glories ""Die! Die! My Darling!"" and ""You'll Like My Mother"", then wimps out at the end."
147,snow-flower-and-the-secret-fan-movie,Jesse Cataldo,38,"Despite gestures toward modernity and clumsy humanism, the film feels regressive, presenting a version of modern China that's as much of an anesthetized fairy tale as its costume-drama past."
148,around-the-bend-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"First-time filmmaker Jordan Roberts worked on this project for years, but merely ended up with dreary cliche."
149,taking-lives-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"A certain genre of thriller depends more upon style and tone than upon plot; it doesn't matter if you believe it walking out, as long as you were intrigued while it was happening."
150,the-other-woman-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"Inside of five minutes I felt an urgent, blinding hatred for almost all its grotesquely overprivileged characters."
151,four-brothers-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,63,"True, John Ford and John Wayne did this stuff a lot better back in the day, but they're not around anymore. John Singleton is, and it's nice to see someone caring enough to keep the tradition alive."
152,hukkle-movie,Maitland McDonagh,70,"A murder mystery wrapped in an experimental portrait of life in a rural Hungarian town, writer-director Gyorgy Palfi's engrossing feature debut is a breathtaking feat of filmmaking. "
153,i-called-him-morgan-movie,Guy Lodge,100,"It’s fitting that Kasper Collin’s excellent documentary I Called Him Morgan, a sleek, sorrowful elegy for the prodigiously gifted, tragically slain bop trumpeter Lee Morgan, is as much a visual and textural triumph as it is a gripping feat of reportage."
154,hitchcock-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,Hitchcock rings false from start to finish.
155,finding-dory-movie,Peter Hartlaub,100,"The sequel is filled with crowd-pleasing action, adventure and characters — sometimes too many characters. But it rises above its crowded narrative with an intense emotional core, taking a protagonist whose affliction had been played mostly for comedy, and exploring the emptiness and loneliness of her plight."
156,shrek-the-third-movie,Kyle Smith,63,"The big new addition in Shrek the Third is Justin Timberlake as the high school-age future King Arthur, but if Timberlake contributed a song to the soundtrack it would have to be ""WhinyBack."""
157,102-dalmatians-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,63,"Though 102 Dalmatians digs up little new ground and muzzles its villain, it does have a fetching sense of functional fun now and then."
158,the-lizzie-mcguire-movie-movie,Ty Burr,63,"So who am I to carp that the film trades in the amiable realism of the show for just another watered-down pop star fantasy? Heck, it beats the Olsen twins. But not by much."
159,the-girl-who-played-with-fire-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"The Girl Who Played With Fire is very good, but a step down from ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" if only because that film and its casting were so fresh and unexpected."
160,the-reader-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"The crucial decision in The Reader is made by a 24-year-old youth, who has information that might help a woman about to be sentenced to life in prison, but withholds it. He is ashamed to reveal his affair with this woman. By making this decision, he shifts the film's focus from the subject of German guilt about the Holocaust and turns it on the human race in general."
161,fat-kid-rules-the-world-movie,Roger Ebert,88,Fat Kid Rules the World is a movie with a title that might be misleading: It's a lot better than it sounds like it has any right to be.
162,rock-the-kasbah-movie,Manohla Dargis,0,"Clichéd, enervating, insulting — it’s tough to settle on a single pejorative for Rock the Kasbah, though abysmal might do."
163,kids-in-the-hall-brain-candy-movie,Adam Smith,80,"Not to everyone's tastes then, but for fans of the show - big, big laughs."
164,crumb-movie,Richard Corliss,100,"""How perfectly goddamned delightful it all is, to be sure."" Irony aside, that's how to respond to this magnificent study in ink and blood."
165,dysfunktional-family-movie,Mark Holcomb,20,"It's nauseating, unfunny stuff, unmitigated by the revelation that Griffin's mom physically abused him. "
166,dirty-girl-movie,Scott Tobias,16,"In many ways, the film is history repeating itself, as the same Weinstein brothers who famously dropped $10 million on ""Happy, Texas"" in 1999 have overpaid again for ""Happy, Texas 2."" "
167,the-promotion-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,Easily the worst movie I've seen so far this year.
168,bucky-larson-born-to-be-a-star-movie,Joe Neumaier,10,"This god-awful, unfunny, stinkingly putrid sketch-comic movie has exactly one snicker-worthy moment, involving Kevin Nealon and a stolen grape. But watching the rest of it will make you whine."
169,welcome-to-yesterday-movie,Roger Moore,63,"Clever, funny but emotionally stunted. Like most teenagers. "
170,raiders!-the-story-of-the-greatest-fan-film-ever-made-movie,Drew Taylor,91,"At its heart, Raiders! is an underdog story, and as with any underdog story, it becomes even more compelling as the stakes are continually raised against our heroes."
171,the-perfect-game-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"The film is perfectly mediocre, which is heartbreaking, not heartwarming."
172,for-a-good-time-call-movie,Steve Persall,0,"Save the money you might spend for a ticket to see For a Good Time, Call... and just read a dive bar's restroom wall for free. That's the sub-level of comedy here, with a litany of crude sexual euphemisms and phallic images passed off as jokes. "
173,an-everlasting-piece-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,In every way dreadful.
174,grown-ups-2-movie,Robbie Collin,20,"So, what happens in Grown Ups 2? Almost absolutely nothing."

176,the-ringer-movie,M. E. Russell,8,The Ringer is appalling.
177,the-human-centipede-first-sequence-movie,Wesley Morris,25,"Tom Six's movie has the freakiness and sadism of its genre, but it's so heavy with self-appreciation -- Dude, we had the craziest premise for a movie! -- that it can't lift off into the perverse ecstasy of decent exploitation. That was also the problem with ""Snakes on a Plane.''"
178,the-punisher-movie,Desson Thomson,0,"Don't hold your breath waiting for The Punisher to be original, not for one second of its torturous two hours. "
179,message-in-a-bottle-movie,Rick Groen,38,"This hunk of celluloid flotsam will come back sooner rather than later, washed up on the remote shelves of your local video store. My advice: shred the message, recycle the bottle."

186,american-reunion-movie,Amy Biancolli,25,American Reunion isn't a total wash. Its one saving grace is Eugene Levy as Jim's dad.

188,beyond-a-reasonable-doubt-movie,Kyle Smith,0,"The would-be noir Beyond a Rea sonable Doubt has an absurd story, but on the plus side you can hardly see what's going on because the photography is so murky."
189,ready-to-rumble-movie,A. O. Scott,10,"Not a satire of the idiocy of professional wrestling, but a long, self-satisfied wallow in it."
190,cats-dogs-the-revenge-of-kitty-galore-movie,Roger Moore,38,Tedious time-killer of a kiddie comedy. 
191,some-kind-of-beautiful-movie,Stephen Holden,10,One of the worst films to sport the label “romantic comedy.”
192,picnic-at-hanging-rock-movie,Ian Nathan,100,A fascinating film that is by turns fascinating and mysterious.
193,the-proposition-movie,Paula Nechak,91,"In the end, this is a film about retribution and justice within unjust circumstances. Each character has a personal code of honor -- Arthur, Charlie and Capt. Stanley are all given their dignity -- and it's that code that sets the film apart."
194,the-ninth-gate-movie,Rene Rodriguez,63,"A devilish little comedy whose urbane, satirical humor will probably sail right over the heads of audiences weaned on Scream."
195,three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,"""Three Billboards"" is a really good movie filled with terrific performances, but what McDormand is doing here surpasses them all."
196,very-bad-things-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"Isn't a bad movie, just a reprehensible one. It presents as comedy things that are not amusing. If you think this movie is funny, that tells me things about you I don't want to know."
197,jason-x-movie,Megan Lehmann,38,"There's a hint of nostalgia toward the end, with Jason encountering two nubile female campers in a virtual reality Camp Crystal Lake -- but it merely serves as a reminder that the franchise should have quit while it was ahead."
198,mike-boy-movie,Roger Moore,0,"This badly-acted, incompetently written, clumsily directed and ineptly-edited fiasco is so awful that spelling the cast and crew’s names correctly in a review is an act of unblinking cruelty."
199,super-8-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Super 8 is in many ways a perfect summer movie: smart, exciting, heartfelt, and suffused with nostalgia. "
200,welcome-to-leith-movie,Diana Clarke,80,"[A] fascinating, unnerving documentary."
201,the-seventh-dwarf-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,10,"Resembling something dwelling in the bottom of the remainder bin, The Seventh Dwarf is a garish-looking, slapdash mashup of an animated fairy tale."
202,the-new-world-movie,Jami Bernard,100,"In the end, it's a sweeping, important film that overturns everything you learned in school about the birth of this nation."
203,vice-2015-movie,Justin Chang,20,"Conveying zero grit, atmosphere or texture (exterior shots are repetitively bathed in cobalt blue), and gathering little in the way of force or dramatic momentum, “Vice” barely engages with its potential ideas beyond the most blandly expository, bullet-ridden level."
204,mother!-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"This one’s a crucible of sweaty pre-natal panic, weird knocks at the door, mind games and ultimately, a roaring, miniature apocalypse set inside a single claustrophobic living room. If that already sounds like your home, it's time to go and give it a try."
205,gravity-movie,Robbie Collin,100,A science-fiction thriller of rare and diamond-hard brilliance.
206,lethal-weapon-2-movie,Michael Wilmington,70,"Lethal Weapon 2 has the brain-rattling pace of a terminal speed freak going the wrong way down an expressway. [7 Jul 1989, p.1]"
207,the-brady-bunch-movie-movie,Michael Wilmington,12,"The Brady Bunch Movie, which was directed and written by at least fivepeople whom we prefer not to embarrass, looks bad, sounds bad and doesn't makeany sense. There's even something nightmarish about it. All these bad jokesand vacant sets become almost horrifying, as if the film were on the verge ofproving that life itself is a bad joke on a vacant set. [17 Feb 1995, p.J]"
208,my-favorite-martian-movie,Carrie Rickey,0,"One possible explanation for My Favorite Martian, a picture so bad it's unwatchable, is that moviemakers are from Mars and moviegoers are from Venus. Not since Howard the Duck has a comedy tried so desperately hard for so pitifully few laughs. [12 Feb 1999, p.17]"
209,a-man-called-ove-movie,Gary Garrison,67,"It’s hard to resist the joy of the film, the unbridled heart, and Ove’s tremendous, hilarious hatred for all the idiots of the world."
210,yogi-bear-movie,Claudia Puig,38,Yogi Bear is a big boo-boo.
211,diamonds-movie,Michael Atkinson,13,"A treacly, ham-fisted, German-American co-production about family ties that should only have been released in the circle of Hell reserved for movie critics."
212,summer-catch-movie,Desson Thomson,30,Uninspired baseball romance.
213,a-little-bit-of-heaven-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"With the abysmal A Little Bit of Heaven, Kate Hudson's possibly unprecedented losing streak remains unbroken: She hasn't made a good movie since Almost Famous, 12 long years ago. Even Nicolas Cage can't say that."
214,life-happens-movie,Diego Semerene,12,L!fe Happens wants us to believe its message is one of female independence and empowerment.
215,taking-lives-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"The movie voids a lot of good will with a cheesy ending. This is just the kind of denouement I was hoping Taking Lives wouldn't sink to, yet it does. "
216,the-closer-you-get-movie,Amy Taubin,10,Clichéd and condescending.
217,300-rise-of-an-empire-movie,Chris Nashawaty,75,"The film belongs to Green — maybe the only actress ever to ""graduate"" from being a Bertolucci muse to a bloodthirsty action-flick dominatrix."
218,the-scandal-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Genteelly erotic, surprisingly emotional, exquisitely made from start to finish."
219,say-anything-movie,Caroline Westbrook,80,"Avoiding the 80s staple of angsty adolescence, Crowe has constructed an intelligent, witty yet undeniably cute tale, showing the potential that would be realised in Singles and Jerry Maguire, and giving Cusack's warm-hearted Lloyd the perfect foil in Skye's prissy model of student perfection."
220,marci-x-movie,Jon Caramanica,0,Moving beyond stultifying to stupefying. 
221,10000-bc-movie,Ken Fox,63,"Too dumb to take seriously, but just silly enough to be sort of fun."

223,rumor-has-it-movie,Laura Sinagra,20,"Maybe it's the terrible lighting, but Friend-out-of-water Aniston spends most of this flick looking like she needs Dustin Hoffman to bang on the glass and get her out of this mess."
224,why-him-movie,Richard Roeper,0,"Not funny, not funny, not funny, not funny, not funny."
225,returner-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"Suzuki and Kaneshiro keep the first hour afloat with their easy comic interplay, but Yamazaki badly needs editing: the opening escape sequence is needlessly repeated later, and a slow drip of false endings drags this out to a tiring 118 minutes. "
226,the-bully-project-movie,Richard Corliss,90,"A documentary as vivid as any horror film, as heartbreaking as any Oscar-worthy drama."
227,signs-wonders-movie,Maitland McDonagh,70,"Spare and coolly evocative, it's a chilling accomplishment."
228,friended-to-death-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,20,"Constant close-ups give the sense that the movie itself is violating viewers’ personal space, while an earnest moral suggests that online communication can’t substitute for face-to-face interaction: a topic Friended to Death doesn’t seem to know much about."
229,pans-labyrinth-movie,Michael Sragow,100,"With a surgical saw instead of a hatchet, del Toro takes apart patriarchy and opportunistic religion as well as fascism."
230,spring-summer-fall-winter-and-spring-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,"Proves that the most local story is sometimes the most universal, the simplest tale sometimes the most complex."
231,fifty-shades-freed-movie,William Bibbiani,30,"Fifty Shades Freed concludes the trilogy as it began, with a romance you can’t believe in, endless montages of affluence, lousy dialogue, weak plotting, and - admittedly - a heck of a lot of sex."
232,the-kid-movie,Wesley Morris,25,Wields its Middle America values and moralistic flogging of idiosyncratic lifestyle choices like a flipped bird.
233,all-the-money-in-the-world-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,An absorbing drama that represents director Ridley Scott (“The Martian”) at his best.
234,girl-interrupted-movie,Wesley Morris,75,"In Winona Ryder's case, Girl Interrupted is a showcase in which her brittle, angry portrait shows she has graduated from ingenue to actress."
235,julieta-movie,Steve Davis,89,One thing about this extremely talented artist: He never sees anything in just black-and-white.
236,my-soul-to-take-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"This utterly mediocre forget-me-now could've been crafted by any faceless serial director at all. The shame of it is that the man behind the camera is Wes Craven when, by all rights, it should have been Alan Smithee.  "
237,the-forbidden-kingdom-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"The Forbidden Kingdom may be nothing but disposable fun, but it is a great, heaping, overflowing helping of fun. If you're 10, it may also seem like ""Citizen Kane."""
238,almost-holy-movie,Robert Abele,70,Almost Holy captures something meaningfully urgent in the brutal day-to-day of tough love amid a world of tougher indifference.
239,silent-hill-movie,Nathan Lee,10,"From first frame to last, not a second of the film has a grip on reality. Structured around a series of blackouts and gross-outs, it is one long free fall through icky surrealism and underlighted nightmares. It takes us to the sort of world where hell is round the corner, secret doors abound and faux-blond policewomen outfit themselves in skin-tight leather."
240,beauty-and-the-beast-2017-movie,Tasha Robinson,31,"It’s largely a frustrating clone of the original movie — same songs, same script, often even the exact same shot choices — but it replaces every moment of authentic or moving emotion with bombast and hyperbolic overemphasis."
241,the-fast-runner-atanarjuat-movie,Paul Malcolm,90,The first REALLY great mythic film of the summer has arrived.
242,jindabyne-movie,Kyle Smith,25,A depressing and tedious movie.
243,green-lantern-movie,Dana Stevens,20,"Even by the standards of the current run of mediocre comic-book movies, this one stands out for its egregious shoddiness."
244,isnt-she-great-movie,Desson Thomson,0,"If it were the last videotape available in the only video store in the remotest corner of Alaska, I'd take one last slug of Jack Daniels and start walking directly into the howling snows."
245,natural-born-killers-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"As a satire on the media's infatuation with violence and murderers, Natural Born Killers hits the bullseye. The problem is, this is a one-note movie. It repeatedly hammers home the same point until the audience is bludgeoned into senselessness."
246,world-traveler-movie,James Berardinelli,38,A huge disappointment -- the kind of motion picture that makes you actively angry at the filmmaker for subjecting you to it and stealing two hours of your life.
247,everybodys-famous!-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"A good-natured comedy of errors from Belgium, should elicit smiles, if not belly laughs."
248,nine-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"In the clumsy hands of director Rob Marshall, this tacky, all-star botch more closely resembles a video catalog for Victoria’s Secret."
249,the-outsiders-movie,Peter Travers,75,"Francis Coppola's revision of his 1983 film of S.E. Hinton's best seller The Outsiders is funny, touching and revelatory, with twenty-two minutes of added footage and a new soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley. [Review of re-release]"
250,apollo-18-movie,Sara Maria Vizcarrondo,20,"Apollo 18 is a drab horror that tries to plant fears about untrustworthy authority (Nixon, NASA, etc) that are as stale as a freeze-dried peas."
251,broadway-the-golden-age-by-the-legends-who-were-there-movie,Desson Thomson,80,This is cinema as oral tradition. And one heck of a cheap-seat deal. 
252,raging-bull-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"The most painful and heartrending portrait of jealousy in the cinema--an ""Othello'' for our times."
253,the-hurt-locker-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"Vivid, assured and extremely suspenseful."
254,recess-schools-out-movie,A.O. Scott,30,"The unfortunate thing is that children will probably waste their summers indoors watching ""Recess"" over and over again."
255,the-scorpion-king-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"As this chaotic barrage of muscle flexing, swordplay, fireballs, crude digital effects and comic-book quips hurls itself off the screen, it's like having several garbage cans clogged with stale pizza, lukewarm cola, soggy French fries and greasy, ketchup-stained napkins emptied over your head."
256,bones-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,Doesn't work at all. Even the structure is off.
257,diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,30,"A mean-spirited little movie, investing its limited charms in all the wrong characters."
258,another-48-hrs-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,"What seems more problematic is the virtual exaltation of Dirty Harry vigilantism, the storm trooper mentality and behavior on Nolte's part that the film breezily takes for granted; if there's any irony about it, it's carefully designed to wash over the storm trooper types in the audience and not give offense to them--only to the rest of us."
259,all-the-queens-men-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,The comedy is nonexistent.
260,den-of-thieves-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"Despite its technical gloss and effective performances, Den of Thieves never manage to feel other than hopelessly derivative."
261,basic-instinct-movie,Terrence Rafferty,10,"A vicious, grindingly manipulative urban mystery that uses a thick atmosphere of S & M kinkiness to distract the audience from the story's thinness and inanity."
262,harvard-man-movie,Phil Hall,10,An astonishing mess.
263,blood-work-movie,Steven Rea,75,Moves along the way its leading man walks along - steady and sure.
264,the-purge-movie,Rex Reed,25,"As a nauseating variation on the home-invasion theme, The Purge is as sickening as it is dreary."
265,annie-movie,Ethan Alter,63,This charming musical based on the comic strip character Little Orphan Annie features many memorable songs and pleasant dance numbers.
266,lucky-them-movie,Leah Greenblatt,67,"The movie is disappointingly flat-footed about both rock and journalism, and its shaggy plot sheds logic as it goes. Still, the actors are excellent; they’re triple crème slathered on an odd little undercooked biscuit of a script."
267,im-still-here-movie,Liam Lacey,25,"Unlike Sacha Baron Cohen's rude semi-documentary satires (Borat, Bruno), I'm Still Here never finds a satiric justification for all this grotesque behaviour."
268,jackie-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"Jackie pummels you with grandeur, with its epic visions of the funeral and that terrible moment in the convertible (all of it rendered in pitch-perfect detail and a subtle 16-millimeter shudder). Yet the film's lasting impact is dazzlingly intellectual: Just as JFK himself turned politics into image-making, his wife continued his work when no one else could."
269,world-trade-center-movie,Brian Lowry,70,"World Trade Center yields lovely and touching moments but proves a slow-going, arduous movie experience."
270,severance-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,70,A lively romp through terrain less traveled than you might think.
271,twisted-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Not surprisingly, only Samuel L. Jackson seems fully to understand that he's in a bad movie, and he makes a virtue of it, using it as an excuse to hang loose, overact and ride the scenes for wherever they might go."
272,selma-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"The film plays like a better episode of ""Mad Men,"" pitch-perfect in its details yet fully lived-in: a universe of rolled-up shirt sleeves, sweat-laden brows and screams that don’t sound canned."
273,extremely-loud-and-incredibly-close-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"The production's penchant for contrivance is insufferable - not a single spontaneous moment from start to finish - and the boy is so precocious you want to strangle him. It's surely not the fault of Thomas Horn, the remarkable young man who plays him."
274,elena-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,100,"A breakthrough movie after its own fashion, a mysterious existential thriller that's brilliantly acted and masterfully directed, without a second of wasted screen time. "
275,the-devils-backbone-movie,Steven Rea,75,"Creepy and compelling and beautifully shot, The Devil's Backbone is a tale of the supernatural that feels completely natural. Its realness is what makes it so scary."
276,surrogates-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,20,"The filmmakers were too busy throwing together potential blockbuster material to notice all the loose ends and gaping holes in logic. Which may, ultimately, explain why Willis looks so confused throughout. Maybe he, too, is straining to locate some intelligence amid all the machinery."
277,beverly-hills-cop-iii-movie,Peter Travers,12,"Whatever juice is left in the ""Cop"" franchise or in the once unstoppable career of Eddie Murphy peters out ignominiously in this poor excuse for a sequel."
278,before-sunset-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,This is a romance with minimal physical contact and sex--and that's part of what makes it work so well as a love story. 
279,carancho-movie,Sam Adams,83,"If anyone's likely to have trouble with Carancho, it's fans of Trapero's previous films, who won't be able to help noticing the sizeable step he's taken toward conventionality."
280,winter-on-fire-ukraines-fight-for-freedom-movie,Eric Kohn,91,"With up-close footage of police beatings and hordes of angry protestors calling for the country's president to resign, Winter on Fire features the intensity of an action movie and the fury of a clear-eyed polemic."
281,beirut-movie,Mark Matousek,63,"Brad Anderson's Beirut doesn't quite make foreign espionage look fun, but it shows how it might appeal to the sort of masochist who's also an adrenaline addict."
282,the-avengers-age-of-ultron-movie,Rosie Fletcher,80,"Part horror, part love story, part morality tale, Age Of Ultron is a smart superhero smackdown that raises the bar once more."
283,the-honeymooners-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"It's not as bad as the average Hollywood movie, it's stupendously worse."
284,ida-movie,David Edelstein,80,"The movie’s chill is hard to shake off. It’s a grimly potent portrait of repression, of what happens to a society that buries its past in an unmarked grave — and lives its present in a state of corrosive denial."
285,stories-we-tell-movie,Oliver Lyttelton,91,"Fans of Polley’s work to date will be delighted by a documentary that serves simultaneously as a gripping mystery, a moving record of a family and a fascinating investigation into the nature of truth, memory, and the documentary form itself."
286,after-auschwitz-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,70,"Kean's perceptive film does an effective job of keeping their moving, lucid observations vitally alive."
287,ready-to-rumble-movie,Edvins Beitks,63,"It's a truly strange coupling of mooning romanticism and rank stupidity that fairly screams, ""Teenage America, we love your money!"""
288,birdman-or-the-unexpected-virtue-of-ignorance-movie,Kimberley Jones,100,"The film is so soaring, sometimes literally, I hardly missed the feeling of hard ground underfoot."
289,step-brothers-movie,Jenni Miller,75,"Step Brothers is a hard R, for good reason. While it's somewhat sweeter, if you will, than a typical Apatow flick, the ludicrous situations call for equally ludicrous behavior and statements."
290,transformers-age-of-extinction-movie,Chris Nashawaty,33,"Ultimately, Age of Extinction is an endless barrage of nonsense and noise. "
291,welcome-to-pine-hill-movie,Nick McCarthy,63,"Keith Miller doesn't always trust the fluency of his visual language, occasionally forcing a point that's already being captured."
292,the-squid-and-the-whale-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,"Insightful, funny-sad memoir of divorce, intellectual style and emotional rebirth."
293,marmaduke-movie,Luke Sader,30,One thing Marmaduke does have in common with the earlier Disney titles is a blessed scarcity of crass bodily-function gags that often pass as family comedy.
294,we-are-still-here-movie,Frank Scheck,70,"Has its pacing problems, and the special effects are strictly of the cheesy variety, but it provides enough genuine scares to make it thoroughly enjoyable, especially if seen at a drive-in on a hot summer night."
295,play-the-game-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,"Has all kinds of good intentions, but the comedy is too broad and the pacing is clumsy. And then there's the Andy Griffith sex scene."
296,cool-world-movie,David Sterritt,38,"Blending animation and live action, this ferocious fantasy is hopelessly vulgar in ways never dreamed of by ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."""
297,a-time-for-drunken-horses-movie,Jonathan Foreman,63,"Ghobadi (himself an Iranian Kurd) takes some gorgeous shots against the snow, but his storytelling is uneven and often slow."
298,miral-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"Confused? So is Miral, a film that makes bits and pieces of the Palestinian experience come alive without assembling them into a coherent vision."
299,cold-weather-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Good in so many subtle ways, I despair of doing them justice. "
300,winters-tale-movie,Liam Lacey,25,"It is sincerely, painstakingly and astonishingly awful."
301,rambo-movie,Carrie Rickey,0,"With its first-person-shooter perspective and gun-andrun narrative, this one’s for the PlayStation crowd. It’s not a movie. It’s an adrenaline pump and purveyor of raw carnage."
302,dr-dolittle-2-movie,Charles Taylor,70,The good-natured silliness of it all kept me laughing.
303,backtrack-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"“I see dead people,” Adrien Brody all but exclaims in Backtrack, a movie that tries to make a choo-choo out of “The Sixth Sense” but immediately goes off the rails."
304,8mm-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"In the uncertain zone between dumb and truly twisted lies 8MM, a movie that will baffle and disgust you in one disconcerting experience."
305,zoolander-movie,Lisa Alspector,20,Isn't absurd enough to be funny.
306,in-this-world-movie,Allison Benedikt,100,"This is an amazing movie, released at a frightening time and made under remarkable circumstances. "
307,in-bruges-movie,Jeremy Mathews,80,"In a film full of great performances, Ralph Feinnes steals the show as Harry, the boss."
308,in-the-line-of-fire-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,78,"In the Line of Fire is a terrific action movie with good performances and a smart script that occasionally falters for trying too hard but, on the whole, takes us on psychological journeys that few of us have had opportunities to experience."
309,the-nice-guys-movie,Drew McWeeny,83,"It is an easy sit, a big fat slice of smart entertainment. Constantly funny, startlingly violent, and oddly heartfelt, The Nice Guys is a grown-up delight, a perfect antidote to the nonstop barrage of effects spectacle that normally marks the summer movie season."
310,best-of-enemies-movie,Robert Abele,90,"In giving historical context to the poisonous nature of our oft-bemoaned political discourse, ""Best of Enemies"" showcases brainy bloodsport with humor, nostalgia and, appropriately, a lacing of melancholy."
311,by-sidney-lumet-movie,Rex Reed,75,"This film is too long for a documentary, and only a true Sidney Lumet fan is likely to sit through nearly two hours of it undistracted. Still, it’s a fascinating exploration of how a great mind worked by allowing the quality of his scripts to determine the style of each film—including not only the inner life but the camera, the clothes, the entire visual approach."
312,swimfan-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,This predictable teenage take on the 'Fatal Attraction' formula goes from dumb to even dumber.
313,arabian-nights-volume-3-the-enchanted-one-movie,Scout Tafoya,88,"As the themes, characters and ideas from the first two parts begin to reappear, so too do full-figured women and gorgeous, semi-nude men right out of the earthly kingdoms of Pasolini. "
314,the-strangers-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"The bad movie in my head was far better than the one on-screen, which offers no twists at all. A twist? There isn't even a curl or a bend."
315,the-haunting-in-connecticut-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"Koteas' overearnest performance almost makes The Haunting in Connecticut worth a look, but ultimately even the star of Cronenberg's ""Crash"" can't salvage what is essentially a substandard rip-off of ""The Amityville Horror."""
316,dog-park-movie,Christopher Brandon,20,A mangy dog of a movie that should have been re-scripted by a better writer and directed by a better filmmaker.
317,patrik-age-15-movie,Ella Taylor,75,"Yet Patrik, Age 1.5 does go further than ""The Kids Are All Right"" in its willingness to test the limits of mainstream tolerance for emerging family forms."
318,the-bitter-pill-movie,Liam Lacey,75,"But it’s Rooney who commands the most attention. As she already proved in David Fincher’s ""The Social Network"" and ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" she has an oddly fascinating screen presence, suggesting both vulnerability and inscrutable levels of calculation. Few actors or actresses can make inexpressiveness look so smart."
319,the-hurricane-heist-movie,Bilge Ebiri,30,"The Hurricane Heist delivers what it promises on some basic level; it’s got plenty of hurricane, and it’s got plenty of heist. But those looking for Sharknado-style idiocy will probably be disappointed, as will those looking for anything that makes sense. That might be the film’s fundamental problem."
320,pompeii-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,25,"Shockingly, the violent release of smoke, fire, and meteoric debris is positioned more as a climactic afterthought than as the main attraction."
321,presumed-innocent-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,80,"A top-notch courtroom drama that will keep you guessing if you haven't read the book; even if you have, it is still a very well crafted story."
322,neil-young-journeys-movie,Kyle Smith,12,The nicest thing I can think of to say about the doc Neil Young Journeys is that at least it isn't in 3-D.
323,asylum-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,80,"David Mackenzie, who directed the remarkable Scottish drama ""Young Adam"" (2003), delivers another masterful, disturbing tale of illicit passion, erotic obsession, and sudden death set in the 1950s."
324,no-place-on-earth-movie,Marc Mohan,75,"Perhaps the most amazing thing about this story is that it would have been lost to history had not American spelunker Chris Nicola happened across mundane relics -- buttons, shoes and the like -- while exploring the cave complex in the 1990s."
325,the-lost-skeleton-of-cadavra-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,70,A parody of B-movies stupid enough -- and yet with just enough brains -- to appeal to the most discriminating fans of the genre.
326,mean-creek-movie,Ruthe Stein,100,One of very few films to accurately portray the experience of growing up male.
327,fire-at-sea-movie,Peter Debruge,70,"Rosi has long been drawn to quiet lives, but has never been quite so successful in conveying the soulful qualities he sees in them to his audience — until now, using the oblique approach of Lampedusa’s residents to spotlight this growing international crisis, while using his young protagonist’s obliviousness to reflect and indict our own."
328,final-destination-movie,Robert Cashill,20,Final destination?  Video store bins.
329,crimson-peak-movie,Peter Bradshaw,80,"Guillermo del Toro’s gothic fantasy-romance Crimson Peak is outrageously sumptuous, gruesomely violent and designed to within an inch of its life. "
330,run-jump-movie,John DeFore,80,Steph Green's first feature has more going for it than a solid dramatic turn by Will Forte.
331,the-girl-on-the-train-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"What the film is really about is social embarrassment, and Bleistein's clear-headed, calm understanding that his old friend has a stupid daughter who has caused fraudulent trouble for a great many people."
332,poltergeist-movie,Roger Moore,38,Blase actors rob this of any prayer of being scary. 
333,accidental-love-movie,Chuck Bowen,0,"So flimsily constructed, visually and narratively, that it resembles a middle-school play that's been hastily filmed on an antique camcorder."
334,driving-lessons-movie,Ronnie Scheib,70,"Basically conservative yet titillatingly ""eccentric"" British laffer could succeed in the ""Full Monty"" import slot."
335,blue-caprice-movie,Eric Kohn,83,"Moors isolates a well-known drama with the fleeting nonfiction prologue and explores it from the inside out: It's not an attempted reenactment, but it does aim to get at certain truths."
336,the-iron-giant-movie,David Hunter,80,"Director Brad Bird (TV's King of the Hill, The Simpsons), adapting the original children's book by the late British poet laureate Ted Hughes, has created a wonderful character in the huge childlike visitor from space."
337,leave-no-trace-movie,Anthony Lane,80,"Only after the movie ends do you understand what Debra Granik, with a consummate sleight of hand, has done. Here, among the peaceful trees, without a shot fired in anger, she’s made a war film."
338,churchill-movie,Godfrey Cheshire,12,"In the annals of historical biopics, Jonathan Teplitzsky’s Churchill stands out as a uniquely awful and tedious caricature of a fascinating subject."
339,crimson-tide-movie,Staff(not credited),88,"Directed by Hollywood's slickest hack, Tony Scott (""Top Gun""), with a script doctored by Quentin Tarantino--you won't need sonar to spot his contributions."
340,grown-ups-2-movie,Richard Roeper,38,"An average Adam Sandler comedy, which, sadly, means it’s a below-average comedy — because whatever comedic fire and bursts of genuinely inspired humor Sandler once possessed have long ago burnt out. "
341,the-time-travelers-wife-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"The movie doesn't really begin or end. Whether the lights have just gone down or the credits have begun to roll, things are pretty much the same for Henry."
342,canvas-movie,Frank Scheck,80,"This autobiographical tale of a 10-year-old boy coping with his mother's severe illness boasts terrific performances from its three leads -- Joe Pantoliano, Marcia Gay Harden and young Devon Gearhart."
343,hope-springs-movie,Joe Morgenstern,70,"The movie perseveres with affecting, sometimes startling candor, and eventually delivers on its promise by confronting the dark fears and furtive hopes of a couple no longer young."
344,the-cat-in-the-hat-movie,Michael Atkinson,0,Comes scarily close to being the most unendurable Hollywood creation of the last dozen years.
345,passengers-2016-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"The whole movie prompts a sense of wonderment: at how boring, dumb and vacant it is; how it fails to give its co-stars enough to do; how the tone changes from one moment to the next; how presumably hard-headed businessmen could have sunk so much money into such a feeble script (the production values are impressive, albeit antiseptic); and, most importantly, how the script raises a crucial question of ethics, then comes up with the wrong answer. "
346,the-signal-2014-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"Its young director, however, has a considerable flair for surprise and visual gusto, and he even, on a shoestring, delivers sharp-looking special effects."
347,oh-boy-movie,Martin Tsai,70,"In spite of its insufferably whimsical tendencies — exemplified by its original title, ""Oh Boy"" — the film may have turned out to be a deeply profound modern postscript about fascism. This isn't that far-fetched a reading at all."
348,nine-lives-2016-movie,Peter Travers,0,"At 87 torturous, laugh-free minutes, the film could change the most avid cat fancier into a kitty hater. "
349,i-am-sam-movie,Peter Travers,30,"Contrived, manipulative and shamelessly sentimental, this film is notable for the courageous reach of Sean Penn, who gives a bold, heartfelt performance."
350,october-country-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"This is the face of dysfunction. Apparently alcohol and drugs are not involved, except perhaps with some of the missing men. The drug here is despair. They seem to treat it with cigarettes."
351,superman-movie,Jack Kroll,80,"Superman turns out to be a surprisingly infectious entertainment, nicely balanced between warmth and wit, intimacy and impressive special effects, comic-strip fantasy and several elements that make the movie eminently eligible for Deep Thinking about rescue fantasies, cherubic messiahs and other pieces of popcorn metaphysics. [1 Jan 1979, p.46]"
352,random-hearts-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"Humorless, lugubrious, and interminable."
353,playing-it-cool-movie,Charles Bramesco,10,"There’s nothing clever or subversive about Playing It Cool, which makes the film’s overt self-satisfaction exponentially more infuriating. "
354,gigli-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"The most thoroughly joyless and inept film of the year, and one of the worst of the decade. We're talking about a disaster, and not of the fun ""Showgirls"" variety, either."
355,existenz-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,78,"In the game of eXistenZ it's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game."
356,red-riding-hood-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"Has the added inconvenience of being dreadfully serious about a plot so preposterous, it demands to be filmed by Monty Python."
357,antichrist-movie,Dana Stevens,10,"The last 20 minutes are horrifically violent, relentlessly claustrophobic, and irredeemably pointless. Von Trier has us on the hot seat, and he's going to walk us through his most primitive sexual nightmares--not because they'll bring us to a greater understanding of madness or love or grief, but just because he bloody well feels like it."
358,dom-hemingway-movie,Barbara VanDenburgh,70,Dom Hemingway is a naughty good time while it lives up to the unpredictable bawdiness of its opening line.
359,toy-story-3-movie,Dan Jolin,100,"A kids’ movie for grown-ups. A grown-up movie for kids. Exactly what you’d expect -- and hope for -- from the latest, and we’re guessing final, Woody and Buzz adventure."
360,love-sex-movie,Jessica Winter,10,All solipsistic jaded-Cosmo patter.
361,the-reader-movie,Matthew Sorrento,10,"The shallowest ""serious"" film to be reeling this year."
362,this-is-england-movie,Jack Mathews,75,"Turgoose, in his first film role, is entirely convincing as the strong-willed but naïve Shaun, and Graham is a genuine fright as the feral prototype of the violent skinhead culture on the horizon."
363,the-twilight-samurai-movie,Mark Jenkins,90,Combines novelistic detail with cinematic sweep.
364,only-god-forgives-movie,Ann Hornaday,25,"The most objectionable thing about Only God Forgives isn’t that it’s shocking or immoral, but that it’s so finally, fatally dull."
365,the-human-centipede-ii-full-sequence-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,12,"There really is no other movie on Earth quite like it. And that's including ""The Human Centipede: First Sequence,"" the 2009 horror film on which this dismal, nauseating and yet bizarrely artful sequel is based."
366,a-million-ways-to-die-in-the-west-movie,Michael Phillips,12,"Plenty of comedies aren't funny, but this one is more than that. It's wholeheartedly narcissistic in its portrait of male petulance and self-pity."
367,fifty-shades-darker-movie,Christopher Gray,25,"Fifty Shades Darker takes the Dark Knight approach to franchise maintenance, taking pains to assure you that its protagonists are serious about their passions. "
368,the-bully-project-movie,A.O. Scott,90,"Bully forces you to confront not the cruelty of specific children - who have their own problems, and their good sides as well - but rather the extent to which that cruelty is embedded in our schools and therefore in our society as a whole. "
369,like-mike-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Appealing movie, one of the summer's pleasant surprises."
370,pokemon-the-movie-2000-movie,A.O. Scott,10,As good as cut-rate animation that seems to consist of screen savers can be.
371,51-birch-street-movie,Ruthe Stein,100,"Block's hypnotic documentary, among the finest of the year."
372,delivery-man-movie,Amy Nicholson,30,Let's not blame Vince Vaughn for this stale cupcake. He's halfway through his Alec Baldwin-like transition from underbaked hunk to charismatic character actor.
373,cafe-society-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,"In his best performance since “The Social Network,” Eisenberg is perfectly cast as the neurotic Bobby. But the film truly belongs to Stewart, who brings to Vonnie a haunting luminousness."
374,enough-movie,Staff (Not Credited),0,"More interested in standard thriller effects than in giving us human beings to contend with. The audience I saw this with seemed to want to feel insulted, and this piece of crap delivered."
375,the-human-centipede-ii-full-sequence-movie,Peter Travers,0,"The film is in black-and-white so the gore doesn't spray quite as colorfully. But you'll still puke up a storm. Not so much at the movie, whose shock value wears off quicky, but at Six, who seems to hate himself almost as much as his audience. Masochists will give the movie a thumbs-up, as long as their thumb isn't already up their ass."
376,detroit-movie,Claudia Puig,98,"Detroit has a vital sense of authenticity, rooted as it is in history, conveyed via Bigelow’s meticulously crafted cinema vérité style that, essentially, thrusts the viewer into the tense events. She is an expert at managing suspense and deftly blending sensitivity with a journalistic sense of details."
377,for-greater-glory-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"The sometimes painfully sincere and slow-moving For Greater Glory clearly aspires to be inspirational, but history won't cooperate. The Cristeros triumphed not because of their faith, but because the United States exerted diplomatic pressure to protect its oil interests in Mexico."
378,the-love-guru-movie,Dana Stevens,0,This tale of a guru who brings joy to all who meet him is the most joy-draining 88 minutes I've ever spent outside a hospital waiting room.
379,kingsglaive-final-fantasy-xv-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,10,This spinoff from the story of a magical kingdom besieged by an evil empire is too ludicrous for words.
380,mindhunters-movie,Sean Axmaker,0,The psychobabble silliness passed off as investigative insight here is laughable at best.
381,the-color-of-money-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"The Color of Money plays better when not under the shadow of The Hustler, which is ultimately a better and more compelling tale."
382,paranorman-movie,Chris Cabin,63,"The tagline for the film reads ""You Don't Become a Hero by Being Normal,"" and the film mostly lives up to that assertion, but only up to a point."
383,men-cry-bullets-movie,Wesley Morris,0,"Overlong, naggingly pretentious, more absurd than absurdist and a cruel, cruel bore."
384,harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"A mature, tense, frightening and altogether masterful film."
385,duck-you-sucker-movie,Don Druker,90,A marvelous sense of detail and spectacular effects--good fun all the way.
386,red-hook-summer-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Formerly a maker of bad, but at least angry, movies, Spike Lee now seems to be trying to be the world's oldest student filmmaker. Take out the rookie mistakes from Red Hook Summer, and there'd be nothing left."
387,the-cat-in-the-hat-movie,David Edelstein,10,"Like being run over by a garbage truck that backs up and dumps its load on top of you. It's a sloppy and vulgar burlesque, one of the most repulsive kiddie movies ever made."
388,ratatouille-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"Ratatouille is as audacious as they come. It takes risks and goes places other films wouldn't dare, and it ends up putting rival imaginations in the shade."
389,this-film-is-not-yet-rated-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"Despite being a little rough around the edges (as is often the case with the work of maverick documentarians), This Film Is Not Yet Rated is more than just an angry diatribe against the MPAA."
390,fools-rush-in-movie,Andy Klein,20,"This really should have gone straight to video--or, better yet, to the nearest landfill."
391,outside-in-movie,Dennis Harvey,80,"Outside In feels eventful, even somewhat suspenseful, as we worry that being around so many screwups of one sort or another might endanger Chris’ still-fragile freedom."
392,clockstoppers-movie,Owen Gleiberman,16,"Stops time, all right -- it stretches 94 minutes into something that begins to feel like infinity."
393,amanda-knox-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,90,"The directors, Brian McGinn and Rod Blackhurst, have produced a tightly edited, coherently structured and ultimately moving reassessment that burrows beneath the lurid in search of the illuminating."
394,finding-vivian-maier-movie,Roger Moore,88,"The truth is far stranger. And Maloof and Siskel reveal it only gradually. They structure their documentary thusly — negatives found, fame and acclaim follow, a post-mortem triumph. And then the REAL Vivian starts to emerge."
395,the-bounty-hunter-movie,Dan Kois,12,"Slack when it should be tight, dull when it needs to be sharp, The Bounty Hunter represents a failed attempt to make an Elmore Leonard movie without having to pay Elmore Leonard money."
396,mesrine-public-enemy-no-1-movie,Stephen Holden,90,The story is deepened with a distinctively European political subtext as the increasingly grandiose Mesrine engages in a running dialogue with various characters about the differences between gangsters and revolutionaries.
397,the-twilight-saga-new-moon-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,30,"New Moon, on the other hand, merely follows a dictated formula. It's a cheap, shoddy piece of work, one that banks on moviegoers' anticipation without even bothering to craft a satisfying experience for them. Its pandering is an insult."
398,road-house-movie,Bill Cosford,25,"Road House makes Cocktail look like a documentary. [19 May 1989, p.6]"
399,take-me-home-tonight-movie,Ty Burr,63,"Completely unoriginal, sure, but watchable and even likable."
400,deadpool-2-movie,Bryan Bishop,81,"The result isn't as novel as the original, or as effortlessly kinetic, but it is nevertheless a joke-packed action film that continues to deliver on the character's potential, while opening up the door to an even bigger series of sarcastic superhero adventures."
401,the-believer-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"A deep and extraordinary film that isn't afraid to look evil in the face -- or, for that matter, to acknowledge that evil can be more complicated and even attractive than we'd want to admit. It's very, very difficult to watch, but you shouldn't miss it."
402,8-heads-in-a-duffel-bag-movie,Keith Phipps,0,Zany antics of the most painful sort.
403,green-zone-movie,Kenneth Turan,80,"Made with daring and passion, it attempts the impossible and comes remarkably close to pulling it off. So close, in fact, that the skill and audacity used, the shock and awe of this highly entertaining attempt, are more significant than the imperfect results."
404,the-hurt-locker-movie,Deborah Young,90,"Tensely action-packed and muscularly directed by Kathryn Bigelow, this tale of an elite U.S. army bomb disposal unit in Baghdad is a familiar story in new clothes, targeted at the young male demographic."
405,wargames-movie,Noel Murray,91,"Badham and company elide a lot of technical details of hacking, but the basics of the nascent computer culture still feel spot-on, right down to the body type and personalities of Eddie Deezen and Maury Chaykin, who play two of Broderick's techno-literate confederates (and work in Seattle, no less). More important is how WarGames plays up the contrast between teenagers—rebellious on the surface but conformist by nature—with a cynical adult world that has become convinced that nuclear annihilation might not be so bad."
406,be-cool-movie,David Sterritt,25,"The overlong comedy has few laughs and flirts far too much with racist, homophobic humor. A waste of a fine cast."
407,the-in-laws-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,All that's missing is wit and humanity.
408,sex-with-strangers-movie,Jonathan Foreman,38,"Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable, shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture."
409,the-informers-movie,Roger Moore,38,"It's a terrible muddle unless you take it as a satire on the Age of Ellis, the Jacqueline Susann for that Flock of Seagulls era. That way, the unintentional laughs seem almost ironic."
410,see-spot-run-movie,Loren King,38,Give David Arquette credit.  He shares nearly all his screen time in See Spot Run with a clever canine and a cute kid and still manages to pull off his usual nutty-slapstick routine with gusto.
411,john-q-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,"Leaves you feeling as if you've been alternately milked and bitch-slapped. Its manipulation is so clumsy and obvious -- and, ultimately, it goes so far astray from its original guiding principles -- that it leaves you feeling dangled and dazed."
412,shes-all-that-movie,Lawrence Toppman,67,"The movie fails the credibility test right here. As those of us who were social rejects in high school know, the two qualities that would defeat any prom candidate are extra weight and a blotchy complexion. Laney has porcelain skin and a sveltely curvaceous figure, so she's a candidate for prom royalty. [29 Jan 1999, p.6E]"
413,the-neverending-story-movie,Vincent Canby,10,"The Neverending Story is a graceless, humorless fantasy for children, combining live actors and animated creatures in mostly imaginary settings."
414,sunshine-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"Directed by Danny Boyle, it lacks even a single moment of charm or interest."
415,faceoff-movie,Adam Smith,100,"Sure there are niggles, the most obvious being the length, which could have been reduced by trimming the prison sequences, but in the end this may be his finest moment so far which, by default, puts it in as having a strong claim on the title ""best action movie ever made"". Really."
416,cinderella-man-movie,Stephen Hunter,70,"With all that going for it, one must ask, why didn't they just tell it completely straight? In other words, why did they feel so compelled to create an utterly bogus Max Baer for the virtuous Jim to fight in the movie's admittedly compelling climactic, championship bout?"
417,the-incredibles-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Isn't just fine family entertainment, it's superior family entertainment. "
418,get-out-movie,John Hazelton,80,Retro horror and racial tension mix to surprisingly entertaining effect in Get Out.
419,a-ciambra-movie,Rory O'Connor,75,One of the great achievements of A Ciambra is how it maps out the food chain of local authorities (both legal and otherwise).
420,what-maisie-knew-movie,Chris Cabin,12,David Siegel and Scott McGehee's film renders the rhapsodic Henry James novel of the same name into an abhorrent slice of tasteless familial drama.
421,the-incredible-burt-wonderstone-movie,Drew Taylor,0,"It's a comedy so out of touch that jokes disappear before they're even delivered, as if by magic."
422,a-thousand-words-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,This is the kind of colossally misguided vanity project.
423,untitled-sherlock-holmes-sequel-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,There's nothing here but wreckage. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is so ineptly made that the story is advanced solely through announcements.
424,the-nutcracker-movie,Roger Ebert,25,From what dark night of the soul emerged the wretched idea for The Nutcracker in 3D? Who considered it even remotely a plausible idea for a movie?
425,s1m0ne-movie,Jack Mathews,88,Hilariously inventive Hollywood satire.
426,o-brother-where-art-thou-movie,Lawrence Toppman,12,"Whenever the music subsides and the characters speak the Coens' lines, the film turns back into mush."
427,spiral-2002-movie,Sean Axmaker,83,"A mix of H.P. Lovecraft madness, David Cronenberg biological mutation and David Lynch small-town weirdness, it teasingly dangles explanations never delivered and escapes never sought, while diving into one of the most gonzo horrors to twist onto celluloid in years."
428,topsy-turvy-movie,Deborah Young,90,This beautifully crafted and lively romp around the 1880s stage world should enjoy its longest life as a vid classic.
429,beastly-movie,Tasha Robinson,16,"In every aspect, from story to tone to characterization to visual aesthetic, it's laughably perfunctory, as though everyone involved were too embarrassed to give it more than a half-ironic token effort."
430,cop-out-movie,J.R. Jones,0,"Nothing to see here, keep moving."
431,the-unknown-known-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"Donald Rumsfeld, then, is almost the perfect foil or adversary to Morris, and part of the absurd magic of Morris’ extended interviews with Rumsfeld is that they almost never feel adversarial."
432,the-house-of-tomorrow-movie,Rex Reed,63,"It’s not much of a movie, but it feels good and leaves you with life-affirming optimism."
433,zoolander-2-movie,Drew McWeeny,25,"Brutally unfunny, visually off-putting, and filled with cameos so embarrassing I am bruised from holding a cringe for a full half-hour, Zoolander 2 is every horrible decision you can make with a comedy sequel wrapped up into one nigh unbearable film."
434,lowriders-movie,Christy Lemire,75,"Lowriders may spell too much out with obvious dialogue, and it may veer a bit too easily toward melodrama. But there’s an earnestness and a fundamental truth to this familial saga—as well as an appealing, low-budget scrappiness—that consistently make it hum."
435,underclassman-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"Underclassman doesn't even try to be good. It knows that it doesn't have to be. It stars Nick Cannon, who has a popular MTV show, and it's a combo cop movie, romance, thriller and high school comedy. That makes the TV ads a slam dunk; they'll generate a Pavlovian response in viewers conditioned to react to their sales triggers (smartass young cop, basketball, sexy babes, fast cars, mockery of adults)."
436,only-god-forgives-movie,Michael Phillips,0,"This is the worst, least, dumbest picture made by people of talent this year."
437,the-promotion-movie,Ken Fox,75,Conrad's script surprises at nearly every turn.
438,the-godfather-part-ii-movie,Tom Huddleston,100,"This is quite simply one of the saddest movies ever made, a tale of loss, grief and absolute loneliness, an unflinching stare into the darkest moral abyss."
439,from-nowhere-movie,Joe Leydon,80,Credible and creditable performances by a fine cast of promising newcomers and familiar veterans enhance the emotional impact of this low-key but compelling indie.
440,the-crow-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"The Crow imbues its comic brutalism with emotion and satire. Too raw and pulpy, it probably shouldn't be regarded as a memorial to Brandon Lee. But as an obsessive rock 'n' roll comic book movie shocker of loony intensity, it stands, or flies, by itself."
441,the-flintstones-in-viva-rock-vegas-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"A depressing show of how truly, madly, deeply outmoded Hollywood can be."
442,year-one-movie,Robert Wilonsky,0,"Unbearably painful from shrugging start to outtakes-laden finish, Harold Ramis’ half-assed, hare-brained return to writing and directing makes Mel Brooks’ equally muddled, soporific ""History of the World, Part 1"" look downright majestic by comparison."
443,the-in-crowd-movie,Lisa Alspector,10,Formula thriller that exploits homosexuality better than murder-mystery clues.
444,big-trouble-in-little-china-movie,Marc Bernardin,83,"There are two kinds of people: the ones who have seen — and love — Big Trouble in Little China, a John Carpenter kung fu Western buddy Chinese ghost love story, and those poor saps who aren’t burdened with having to try and describe it to the uninitiated."
445,red-eye-movie,Marc Savlov,67,"Red Eye's no classic, but with its smart, twisty little script and those two killer performances, it is a helluva lot of fun."
446,stuart-little-2-movie,Sean Axmaker,67,"Wholesome, warm and energetic -- if predictable."
447,life-in-a-day-movie,Scott Tobias,35,"Produced in partnership with YouTube and distributed by National Geographic Films, the documentary Life in a Day is offspring with the worst genetic traits of both: narcissism on a global scale, speckled with pretty pictures. In a world without books or magazines, this is the movie people would watch in the waiting room at the dentist's office."
448,hidden-figures-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Lots of movies are labeled as ""inspirational"" – Hidden Figures truly earns the right to the term."
449,meeks-cutoff-movie,Ty Burr,88,"There's nothing out there remotely like Meek's Cutoff, for which some viewers may be thankful. The ending seems calculated to drive the literal-minded screaming out of the theater and yet it's the only possible way out."
450,in-the-name-of-my-daughter-movie,Peter Keough,38,"More disappointing than the film’s inertia and amorphousness is its sacrifice of the real-world themes of class, money, corruption, and power. Unable to decide what story he wanted to tell, Téchiné hedges his bets and loses everything."
451,8-mile-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,"Transcends its star's controversial career and, in the bargain, stands head, shoulders and heart above every other Hollywood movie that we've seen so far this year."
452,a-home-at-the-end-of-the-world-movie,Sheri Linden,70,"Cunningham's 1990 novel makes an assured, if not entirely satisfying, transition to the big screen in this terrifically acted exploration of the bonds that transcend traditional notions of family. "
453,goodbye-christopher-robin-movie,Marc Savlov,67,"You may want to bring a handkerchief, so boldly manipulative the movie ends up being, but for fans of Pooh and the power of art as therapy during times of existential crises, the story is never less than interesting and melodramatically well-done."
454,unknown-2011-movie,Manohla Dargis,70,"Despite its A-movie aspirations, as the chases continue and the plot holes widen, Unknown quickly settles into the familiar B-movie comfort zone. "
455,mom-and-dad-movie,Roger Moore,63,"Mom and Dad is a reminder of how much gonzo fun a B-movie can be, how hilarious “Crank” was and what a hoot Nicolas Cage — who makes almost entirely B, C and D movies these days — is when he’s uncaged and unhinged."
456,the-human-centipede-first-sequence-movie,Michael Ordona,0,"There are terrible movies and there are loathsome movies. And then there's that rare breed so idiotic, exploitative and sickening one wishes they could be scrubbed from memory. The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is such a specimen. Would that I had 100 legs to kick it."
457,the-class-movie,Sean Axmaker,100,"The young cast, all nonactors who developed their characters with Cantet and Bégaudeau, brings the weight of full lives to each of the students."
458,museum-hours-movie,Tom Dawson,80,"Blurring documentary/fiction boundaries, writer/director Jem Cohen’s film is deceptively simple. "
459,the-insider-movie,David Edelstein,90,"A big, overlong, and rather unwieldy piece of storytelling, but the story it has to tell is so vital that it cuts through all the dramaturgical muddiness. It's a terrific muckraking melodrama--it will get people fuming."
460,mohawk-movie,Ally Johnson,67,"With its politically charged themes of oppression and the genocide of Native Americans, and the play on how history has been presented in the past, Mohawk is a fascinating and engaging tale of bloody revenge."
461,contraband-movie,Kyle Smith,12,Contraband aims to be dumb fun but gets only the first half right. 
462,hardcore-henry-movie,Peter Travers,63,"It's all about the ride, the relentless wallop and whoosh. But, hey, sometimes that's all a cine-junkie needs for a fix."
463,cats-dogs-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,Grindingly tedious.
464,derrida-movie,Holly Willis,90,"The result is fascinating, whether you're smitten by him or his work, or simply intrigued by contemporary thought."
465,garfield-a-tail-of-two-kitties-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,16,Tedious almost beyond endurance.
466,i-heart-huckabees-movie,David Edelstein,10,Russell is a manically inventive writer-director--maybe the most fearless talent of his generation. It's not a contradiction to say that I admire him more than ever while pronouncing Huckabees an unmitigated disaster.
467,heist-movie,Michael Sragow,63,"As a movie, Heist is merely an amiable time-killer. But it presents a terrific argument for federalizing airport security."
468,the-seventh-son-movie,Betsy Sharkey,10,"I know it's early, but Seventh Son may actually be the worst movie of the year. It will most certainly be a contender. The medieval/fantasy/action/drama/romance hits pretty close to a perfect 10 on the egregious scale."
469,the-emoji-movie-movie,Tim Grierson,10,"A film as mindless and disposable as most smartphone apps — and nowhere near as addictive — Sony’s animated The Emoji Movie is a calamitous comedy that inadvertently shows how difficult it is to pull off the witty, imaginative world-building that Pixar makes seem so breezy."
470,white-nights-movie,Jay Scott,38,"White Nights is too ponderous to have the pizzazz of trash and too dumb to have the insight of art - it's a lumbering behemoth of a film in which the extraordinary talent of its one authentic star, Mikhail Baryshnikov, is exploited in a Cold War cartoon that suggests a musical adaptation of Ayn Rand's anti- Soviet novel, We The Living. [22 Nov 1985]"
471,just-married-movie,Jack Mathews,25,"Most of the incidents are harmlessly derivative, but the movie has a mean streak that undermines our empathy for the characters, particularly Tom."
472,the-new-guy-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,38,"Tries everything possible to win you over -- satire, gross-out comedy, even earnest romance. But as any high-schooler can tell you, the harder you try, the bigger you fall."
473,whipped-movie,Tom Keogh,0,"We're forced to listen to misogynistic rantings devoid of wit, entertainment value, or even authenticity."
474,metroland-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Metroland, which is adapted from a novel by Julian Barnes, is an oddly unpleasant variation on the theme of ""The Way We Were."" [09 Apr 1999]"
475,levity-movie,Kim Morgan,16,"Ponderous, pretentious and boring, Levity becomes ironic on top of itself. You won't pity these people. You'll start laughing at them. Like a clown. "
476,the-accountant-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,"Fresh and delightfully offbeat, The Accountant proves that a thriller can be complex and nuanced while fulfilling its mission to entertain."
477,nico-and-dani-movie,Kevin Maynard,70,Nico and Dani merely retells a not uncommon tale without significantly enriching it. It's just too familiar to play as poignantly as it would like to.
478,keeping-up-with-the-steins-movie,Michael Phillips,38,Squanders a decent comic premise.
479,janis-little-girl-blue-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,75,"While aesthetically it doesn’t do much to break the form, it more than succeeds in presenting Joplin as a flawed, insecure, deeply brilliant woman who, unfortunately, couldn’t shake her demons."
480,vampires-suck-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"You want vampiric satire with actual laughs? Try Mel Brooks' ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"" ""Love at First Bite,"" or even Roman Polanski's ""The Fearless Vampire Killers."" Anything is better than Friedberg and Seltzer's endless, bargain-basement, sub-Cracked magazine un-comedy.  "
481,interview-with-the-assassin-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,"It's just a gimmick, right down to its Washington release date."
482,another-48-hrs-movie,Gene Siskel,38,"This is a generic action picture. What also is missing are scenes in which Nolte and Murphy could relate to each other quietly and with some wit. [8 Jun 1990, p.C]"
483,three-identical-strangers-movie,Glenn Kenny,75,"With its frequent dramatizations, zippy editing, and song-driven soundtrack, Three Identical Strangers may be said to indulge in the most potentially egregious of mainstreaming devices used in contemporary documentaries. Yet because the story itself is so, well, juicy, and the subjects one-time pop culture phenoms, the approach feels acceptable if not entirely “right.”"
484,enough-movie,Desson Thomson,0,"In terms of actual social conscience, the movie gets a demagogic, rabble-rousing F. It also gets a failed grade for honest writing."
485,good-luck-chuck-movie,Glenn Kenny,0,"If raunch-comedy maestro Judd Apatow had not just an evil, but an evil-and-untalented twin, this grotesque excrescence would be his signature work."
486,iraq-in-fragments-movie,Ann Hornaday,80,"A vivid, poetic evocation of life in post-invasion Iraq that works both as impressionistic collage and candid portraiture."
487,monsieur-lazhar-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"Monsieur Lazhar doesn't send you home depressed. Instead, the film leaves you hopeful, and even exhilarated, that even the most painful wounds can sometimes heal."
488,incendies-movie,Ted Fry,75,A deeply resonant literary quality gives what might otherwise seem like a dubious series of coincidences a profound sense of plausibility.
489,just-married-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,30,"Dude, where's the script?  Just Awful."
490,drive-me-crazy-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"Slight and sweet, not a great high school movie but kinda nice, with appealing performances by Hart and Grenier."
491,basic-instinct-2-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,A disaster of the highest or perhaps lowest order.
492,universal-soldier-the-return-movie,Paul Malcolm,10,A mind-numbing exercise in high body counts and big tits.
493,me-and-earl-and-the-dying-girl-movie,Peter Debruge,90,"Blending wit and modesty, Mann fits the bill, coming across as an overgrown kid with a good heart, but virtually no practice in relating to others — which is perhaps the thing that makes his experience so profoundly relatable."
494,raw-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"This French-language horror film is shockingly well made for a debut feature: Julia Ducournau, who wrote and directed it, really knows her stuff and is clearly bound for mainstream success, if that’s where her appetites take her."
495,the-man-from-uncle-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"Though it's made with lots of modern tricks and technology, it's old-fashioned in the best sense, and not just because it's set in the Sixties. "
496,special-correspondents-movie,David Ehrlich,33,"Special Correspondents is more about smirking sideways than it is laughing out loud, but it doesn't provoke much of either — it's one thing for Gervais to subdue his usual bark, but his bite has never been softer. "
497,the-iron-giant-movie,Roger Ebert,88,Not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say.
498,clerks-movie,Clark Collis,80,Smith's script simply crackles with an endless succession of humorous gags and on-the-ball observations while Anderson's brilliant performance as the shop assistant from hell is worthy of a film 100 times as expensive.
499,harry-brown-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,75,"Those of us who love Michael Caine have to recognize that his capacity for coldness is part of what makes him great. And in that respect, what he does in Harry Brown is something of a bookend to his extraordinary, and extraordinarily chilly, turn in Mike Hodges' cold-blooded 1971 Get Carter."
500,the-sweetest-thing-movie,Mark Caro,38,"Lacks the meanness of so many recent gross-out comedies. With the sparkling Diaz leading the way, the lame humor is much more palatable."
501,the-back-up-plan-movie,J.R. Jones,0,"As romantic comedies go, this is the worst drivel I've seen since Nia Vardalos's ""I Hate Valentine's Day."""
502,accidental-love-movie,Chris Nashawaty,0,The race for the worst film of 2015 is officially on.
503,the-abandoned-movie,Owen Gleiberman,16,"The gimmick in The Abandoned is that people battle their zombie doubles, whom they can't kill, since they'd be killing themselves. But the movie sinks so deep into deathly atmosphere that there's no life to it."
504,apollo-18-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,20,"All Apollo 18 has to offer is endless radio crackle and visual incoherence. And what's out there, tormenting the astronauts? The answer is dumber than a box of moon rocks."
505,the-matador-2005-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"There's nothing edgy or groundbreaking about The Matador, but it's funny, touching, and ultimately endearing."
506,the-imaginarium-of-doctor-parnassus-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,80,"If you're game, ""Parnassus"" is a richly rewarding experience. If not, it comes off like pretentious nonsense."
507,drag-me-to-hell-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,90,"Raimi's still very much up to his old tricks, retaining that deliriously over-the-top brand of Grand Guignol horror that he had abandoned by the mid-'90s in pursuit of other genres."
508,batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-movie,Brian Roan,16,It is a movie ostensibly about consequences that never lingers long enough on its own story to consider that the things happening in the narrative present ought to have consequences as well. Very little matters; very little makes sense.
509,cinderella-movie,Joe Williams,38,"Cinderella is so scrubbed of personality, it’s not even worth calling a mess."
510,starlet-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"Sean Baker's singular little ultra-indie is a strikingly unsentimental study in female friendship between unmoored souls in L.A.'s bleached, glamour-challenged San Fernando Valley. "
511,but-im-a-cheerleader-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,38,"Tries to be both poignant and wicked, and succeeds at neither."
512,room-237-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"Ascher treats all these insane theories seriously, but that doesn’t mean you have to. "
513,slackers-movie,Peter Travers,10,A shit stain on the genre.
514,a-fish-called-wanda-movie,Jay Scott,100,"May be less than the sum of its parts, but its parts are more impressive than most other wholes around."
515,the-replacements-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"A desperate, broad comedy."
516,double-take-2001-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,"Another racial cartoon buddy movie that eagerly flogs its best laugh -- indeed, its only laugh -- in the trailer."
517,we-are-your-friends-movie,Glenn Kenny,38,"While I might actually go out and buy the soundtrack album, the last thing I’m gonna say about the movie is friends shouldn’t let friends pay money to see We Are Your Friends. "
518,the-business-of-strangers-movie,Peter Travers,90,A maliciously funny and keenly observant movie -- director-writer Patrick Stettner makes a potent feature debut -- that serves its humor dark and without artificial sweeteners.
519,machine-gun-preacher-movie,Pete Hammond,80,"The exploitation title may not do it any favors, but this biopic based on the incredible life journey of Sam Childers is gripping, inspirational and well told."
520,into-the-forest-movie,Peter Sobczynski,75,"The one major problem with Into the Forest, the one that keeps it from making that final leap of good movie to a potentially great one, is that the final third is just not quite as strong as the stuff that precedes it."
521,gloria-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"I found myself praying that the film would jam and melt and, well past the halfway point, it did, and I was sprung, 30 minutes early."
522,the-maltese-falcon-movie,Bosley Crowther,100,"It's the slickest exercise in cerebration that has hit the screen in many months, and it is also one of the most compelling nervous-laughter provokers yet."
523,view-from-the-top-movie,Ty Burr,12,Who on earth is this embarrassment -- easily the worst film of the year to date -- aimed at? 
524,take-the-lead-movie,Carrie Rickey,63,"At one point, Dulaine takes the students to his studio and they look up at the mirrored disco ball glittering above the dance floor. ""Corny, but cool,"" says one of the sweathogs. My feelings about the film precisely."
525,pent-movie,Paul Malcolm,30,Lamely engineered and thoroughly exploited tragedy.
526,the-namesake-movie,Dennis Lim,90,"Despite being rooted in knotty issues of identity, Lahiri's novel forgoes didacticism in favor of vivid portraiture. Nair and her uniformly superb cast take the same tack: The characters are individuals before they are emblems."
527,coco-before-chanel-movie,Kenneth Turan,80,"A superior filmed biography that brings intelligence, restraint and style to what could have been a more standard treatment."
528,the-adventures-of-baron-munchausen-movie,Jay Scott,0,"Despite an inspired central section involving Robin Williams as the King of the Moon and Valentina Cortese as his Queen, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is a near-disaster of Ishtarish proportions. [11 Mar 1989, p.C3]"
529,oscar-and-lucinda-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"Flawless contributions by Armstrong's crew make Oscar and Lucinda a vibrant period piece, buoyant yet incisive, and easily sustaining interest, if not generating deep involvement, throughout a just-under two-hour running time.  [31Dec1997 Pg.8]"
530,21-grams-movie,Peter Travers,88,You won't see more explosive acting this year.
531,when-brendan-met-trudy-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"It has that unwound Roddy Doyle humor; the laughs don't hit you over the head, but tickle you behind the knee."
532,the-reunion-movie,Ronnie Scheib,10,"A flabby, unfunny action-comedy produced, directed and written by former WWE exec VP Mike Pavone, The Reunion boasts one of the most poorly assembled scripts to emerge from the wrestling franchise. "
533,the-nutcracker-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,"Misconceived, bloated and incredibly ugly fantasy epic."
534,trainwreck-movie,Ian Nathan,80,"At times it feels as if five different films are going on at once, but Schumer’s whip-smart delivery and no-holds perkiness keeps it all in place. Just as her director wilfully mines his own life for laughs, there is a whole lot of Amy in Amy. "
535,never-die-alone-movie,Richard Harrington,20,A bumbling adaptation of the same-titled novel by Donald Goines.
536,secretariat-movie,Justin Chang,90,Conventional but rousingly effective picture. 
537,smash-his-camera-movie,Frank Scheck,70,"Filmmaker Leon Gast (""When We Were Kings"") paints an entertaining portrait of the still-working 79-year-old photographer."
538,ai-weiwei-never-sorry-movie,Manohla Dargis,90,"The fluidity and convenience of digital moviemaking tools explain some of its freshness, as does Ms. Klayman's history as a budding documentarian. It's clear from watching both the feature and its earlier iterations that, while she was learning about Mr. Ai, she was also learning how to tell a visual story. It's easy to think that hanging around Mr. Ai, a brilliant Conceptual artist and an equally great mass-media interpolater, played a part in her education. "
539,mr-turner-movie,Ian Nathan,100,"Shimmering with awards potential, Leigh’s glorious picture is a hilarious, confounding, wholehearted and dazzlingly performed portrait of an artist as an ageing man. "
540,days-of-glory-movie,Stephen Hunter,70,"Is there anything new here? Honestly, not really. The content is the same, the plot the familiar litany of ordeals leavened by soapy interludes. But the fight that develops is taut, tough and extremely bitter; it's never showy in the grinding, big-movie Spielbergian way, but a portrait of the war's daily interface with hell in a very small space, as the four stand against a much larger unit."
541,the-ledge-movie,Kyle Smith,12,Coincidence and contrivance are the name of the game throughout.
542,solitary-man-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"Superb as an auto salesman who sinks deeper and deeper into disgrace in Solitary Man, Douglas' juiciest vehicle since ""Wonder Boys."""
543,couples-retreat-movie,Scott Tobias,33,"Features a running gag about a little boy in the midst of potty training who doesn’t always go where it’s appropriate. In a nutshell, that subplot explains everything that’s wrong about the film."
544,mechanic-resurrection-movie,Josh Kupecki,30,A flat and tedious action film that elicited the most lethal response possible when I asked my movie date what she thought after the credits rolled: “boring.” Agreed.
545,kids-in-the-hall-brain-candy-movie,Roger Ebert,25,I felt the Kids were too busy being hip and ironic to connect at the simpler level where comedy lives. They were brought down by their own self-protective devices. 
546,elena-movie,Justin Chang,90,A wise and impeccably controlled drama that finds Russian helmer Andrei Zvyagintsev in outstanding form.
547,krisha-movie,Eric Kohn,83,"Krisha snaps into focus whenever Shults' camera remains trained on his extraordinary lead, whose fierce commitment easily recalls a similar portrait of middle-aged alcoholism in ""A Woman Under the Influence"" — and, at under 90 minutes, matches its intensity in half the time."
548,the-weather-underground-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,88,"Offers a welcome perspective, reminding us that extremism in the name of a values system is nothing new -- not even on these shores. "
549,fire-at-sea-movie,Matt Looker,100,"Rosi offers a simple, stark contrast between quiet moments of everyday life and tragedy as mass fleeing results in sunken boats, horrific injuries and death."
550,salinger-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"Salinger thinks it’s big, important news, but it’s barely a footnote."
551,the-hoax-movie,Shawn Levy,67,"It's all polished and slick and credible, but it never truly engages. Perhaps it's because Irving's story is well-known; perhaps it's because of the script's repetitions and tangents; or perhaps it's simply because Hallstrom himself is ambivalent about his protagonist."
552,million-dollar-baby-movie,Ann Hornaday,90,"The heart of Million Dollar Baby lies in the core relationships among Frankie, Maggie and Scrap, friendships so pure, so genuine, so authentic that it takes actors of Eastwood's, Swank's and Freeman's caliber to sell them in this otherwise cynical world."
553,observe-and-report-movie,Betsy Sharkey,10,"It heaps piles of bad, crazy stuff at our feet then walks away. There is no moral to this story, and there's not much comedy either."
554,little-big-man-movie,S. K.,90,"It also accomplishes that rarest achievement, the breathing of life into an ossified art form. The '70s has its first great epic."
555,law-abiding-citizen-movie,Joe Williams,25,"A vigilante/torture-porn potpourri, is particularly toxic because it's scented with phony importance."
556,splice-movie,Mary Pols,90,"The movie is ridiculously over the top, inelegant and so defiantly ?crazy?that it works, reminding you how fun gore and creatures that go bump ?(and? grind) in the night can be. It's a sci-fi horror film, but no actual ?comedy?has made me laugh as much this year as Splice.?"
557,pure-luck-movie,Owen Gleiberman,16,"Just about unwatchable — a numbingly repetitive farce in which the cursed Short trips, walks into walls, trips, spills an entire saltshaker onto his breakfast, trips, sets people on fire, trips…"
558,the-brothers-grimsby-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"This is Baron Cohen’s worst film, period. "
559,to-rome-with-love-movie,Liam Lacey,63,"The current postcard from abroad is not great, but not grating."
560,boy-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"A film like this would have little chance without the right casting, and James Rolleston is so right as Boy, it's difficult to imagine anyone else."
561,hysteria-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"Whenever Rupert Everett appears as a rich fellow who distinctly does not fancy ladies, it's a hysterical history lesson of the hilarious variety."
562,flight-of-the-red-balloon-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,70,"There's not much story here, but the characters are substantial: a single mother (nicely played by Juliette Binoche) who runs a local avant-garde puppet theater and is preoccupied with such matters as a downstairs tenant who refuses to pay rent or leave, her neglected but mainly cheerful son, and his Taiwanese nanny, a filmmaker in her spare time."
563,world-war-z-movie,Eric Kohn,67,"World War Z may wear its intellect proudly, but also consciously translates the zombie premise into a safer context for wider audiences. It's not the smartest zombie movie ever made, but might be the most commercial one."
564,transformers-movie,Anthony Lane,70,"In previous movies, Michael Bay dabbled wearily in Homo sapiens. At last he has summoned the courage to admit that he has an exclusive crush on machines, and I congratulate him on creating, in Transformers, his first truly honest work of art."
565,grind-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,"If you stay awake, you'll certainly feel more than a little ground down after watching perhaps 15 minutes of skateboard footage padded out with nearly 90 minutes of strenuously unfunny toilet humor - all cheaply filmed on a budget that looks as if it would scarcely cover the catering bill for ""Gigli."""
566,gigli-movie,Kim Morgan,33,"Has a curious train-wreck quality to it that keeps you watching and thinking. (Even if you are thinking things like, Why were these lines ever written? When you hear the ""turkey"" line, your jaw will drop.) "
567,land-of-the-blind-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"Dark, grim, and cliched Orwellian satire."
568,everybodys-fine-movie,Stephen Holden,10,The queasiness produced by this sentimental weepie builds into a wave of nausea during its interminable finale.
569,the-other-woman-movie,Sheri Linden,30,This soapy drama manages to be both half-baked and overcooked. 
570,still-walking-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"A film of droll and dry observational precision, its emotional minimalism is almost fetishistic -- and, by the end, a tad frustrating."
571,paddington-movie,Claudia Puig,75,"Whishaw, Hawkins and Downton Abbey's Bonneville strike just the right notes. Imaginative production design, which occasionally brings to mind Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" adds to the story's appeal."
572,unforgiven-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"Simultaneously heroic and nihilistic, reeking of myth but modern as they come, it is a Western for those who know and chrish the form, a film that resonates with the spirit of films past while staking out a territory quite its own. [7 Aug 1992]"
573,action-point-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,30,"True, Johnny Knoxville gets power-hosed down a slide and catapulted into a barn for our amusement, but the inventive, stake-raising, borderline surrealist gags of the old “Jackass” are gone."
574,hustle-flow-movie,M. E. Russell,100,"The writing, acting and filmmaking make Hustle & Flow nothing short of amazing."
575,dressed-to-kill-movie,Gary Arnold,90,"When it comes to the tantalizing prolongation of suspense, nobody does it better than De Palma. He has absorbed and adapted the Hitchcock's fondness and flair for sustaining exposition through sheer pictorial virtuosity, his mischievous erotic humor and even his ambiguous mixture of morbid, romantic and comic impulses. [25 July 1980, p.C1]"
576,tristram-shandy-a-cock-and-bull-story-movie,Leslie Felperin,70,"Cheating flagrantly, helmer Michael Winterbottom has pulled off the trick -- sort of -- with the wickedly playful Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story."
577,janis-little-girl-blue-movie,Noel Murray,83,"Whenever the story starts to drag, Berg cuts to a scene like Big Brother’s era-defining performance of “Ball And Chain” at Monterey, which had even Los Angeles’ prematurely jaded rock superstars gaping in justified awe. They knew they were watching something explosive, in a package too fragile to contain it."
578,the-boy-next-door-movie,Robert Abele,30,"Breathless, uninspired January junk that feels like the iffiest bits of a Lifetime movie and late-night cable schlock slapped together. (And not erotically.)"
579,offside-movie,Marrit Ingman,89,"This is Iranian cinema at its most accessible: a bit slow even in its 92 minutes, with more environment than story, but deeply immersive and thought-provoking, and quite often funny."
580,the-triplets-of-belleville-movie,Rene Rodriguez,100,"The movie itself is a nominee for Best Animated Feature, and it's good enough to pull a surprise upset over the beloved Finding Nemo. It's a mad masterpiece."
581,loving-jezebel-movie,Jessica Winter,20,An oafish wish-fulfillment wankfest.
582,it-runs-in-the-family-movie,Mark Caro,75,Never quite transcends its movie-of-the-week trappings. But either you're glad to have spent time with these three generations or you aren't. Bottom line: I was.
583,victor-frankenstein-movie,Steve Persall,25,"Victor Frankenstein is misshapen as the bad doctor's creature itself, straining without wit or viscera to be a devilish horror romp. "
584,primary-colors-movie,Jack Garner,100,"Perhaps Nichols and May's greatest accomplishment is capturing perfectly on film the mysterious, complex, compromised relationship the public has with today's political leaders."
585,alls-faire-in-love-movie,John Anderson,20,"Verily, this Scott Marshall-helmed production has several nutjob supporting performances that almost rescue its hackneyed plot, but there's not enough consistent madness to keep the film from what will be a fleeting theatrical career, followed by entombment on homevid."
586,going-upriver-the-long-war-of-john-kerry-movie,David Sterritt,100,Absorbing. 
587,i-am-sam-movie,Shawn Levy,33,"This isn't an ordinary film built on a remarkable performance; it's a poor one with a gem at its core. Penn can elevate it to mediocrity, but he cannot make it fly."
588,the-spy-next-door-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,20,"The movie even has the nerve to start with a montage of moments from his better films, a bad idea that sets off an escalating tumble downhill."
589,josie-and-the-pussycats-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"Josie and the Pussycats are not dumber than the Spice Girls, but they're as dumb as the Spice Girls, which is dumb enough."
590,blind-date-1987-movie,Bill Cosford,75,"When it's working Blind Date is frenzied and very funny. It's a return to form for Blake Edwards, who has made a good many bad movies over the past 10 years. And in Willis and Basinger there is the kind of team that, back in the good old days, would have launched a series -- not sitcom/sitdram, but big-screen. [27 Mar 1987, p.D1]"
591,raw-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"Even though there’s a great deal to admire in Ducournau’s debut outing, Raw will mostly appeal to the taste buds of horror connoisseurs. Skittish consumers should consider other dining options."
592,a-sound-of-thunder-movie,Maitland McDonagh,20,The profoundly unconvincing CGI work only makes the sorry screenplay and lackluster performances look worse.
593,the-king-of-kong-a-fistful-of-quarters-movie,Scott Schueller,100,Gordon's documentary proves better than 90 percent of the manufactured stories out this summer. One can breathe a sigh of relief that it was done right and not cobbled into another bad fictional comedy.
594,jersey-girl-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"It's an unabashedly square picture, and proud of it. It is also a warm, funny, earnest movie, a stand-up exercise in a kind of Hollywood melodrama -- the feel-good weepie -- that has long been out of fashion."
595,my-golden-days-movie,Oliver Lyttelton,91,"The film doesn't reinvent the wheel: it is, ultimately, a middle-class-white-boy coming-of-age tale of the kind that the cinema of France, and elsewhere, has never been lacking. But it's written, shot, cut and performed with such palpable joy, intelligence and warmth that it ends up feeling entirely fresh. "
596,avengers-infinity-war-movie,Brian Truitt,88,"It could have been an unholy mess, but with directors Anthony and Joe Russo at the helm, Infinity War is instead a glorious, multilayered and clever comic-book adventure with loads of emotional stakes and a perfect foe for Earth’s mightiest heroes."
597,the-lovers-movie,Clayton Dillard,12,"A shamelessly derivative and preposterous would-be blockbuster that goofily fashions itself as a sweeping romance, time-travel sci-fi tale, and gallant period piece all at once. "
598,the-real-blonde-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,Never manages to make its characters anything other than cartoons. 
599,the-dark-half-movie,Mike Clark,25,"George A. Romero, less Living Dead here than dying artistically, adapts Stephen King in a movie without a good half. [23 Apr 1993, p.4D]"
600,mystic-river-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"Deals with themes Eastwood has often explored before, but never so delicately or with as much sad wisdom: The way in which our past haunts our present, the lasting repercussions of violence and the cruel inexorability of fate."
601,deadpool-2-movie,Daniel Krupa,78,"Despite the character’s trademark flippancy, there’s a real unexpected warmth to Deadpool 2. Not only does the sequel explore this flawed character, it firmly establishes him as a loveable and effective hero."
602,ask-the-dust-movie,Scott Foundas,70,"What seduces most about Ask the Dust isn't its verisimilitude, but its gloriously old-fashioned backlot sheen - the L.A. of old Hollywood movies and of our collective fantasies."
603,soylent-green-movie,Staff (Not Credited),70,The somewhat plausible and proximate horrors in the story of Soylent Green carry the production over its awkward spots to the status of a good futuristic exploitation film.
604,godzilla-1998-movie,Keith Phipps,10,"While the special effects are impressive, countless films have already proven that if you sink enough money into a project, you can at least make it look good. Unfortunately, good looks are all Godzilla has going for it."
605,even-cowgirls-get-the-blues-movie,Janet Maslin,30,"One of the many problems with Gus Van Sant's tortured, worked-over Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is that Sissy Hankshaw talks like a novel, and a dated one at that."
606,heading-south-movie,Ella Taylor,70,An absorbing extension of Cantet's abiding obsession with the seeding of political inequality in intimate relations.
607,stir-of-echoes-movie,Desson Thomson,90,"There's visceral horror, too, including a grisly image -- a horror-in-miniature involving a fingernail -- that located an open nerve in my jaded ability to endure screen violence."
608,glee-the-3d-concert-movie-movie,Ty Burr,38,"It's a working illustration of what differentiates movie stars from TV stars. When we buy a ticket for a George Clooney movie, it's because we want to see George Clooney (or Emma Stone or Tom Hanks or whomever). The real stars of ""Glee,"" on the other hand, are the characters, not the actors."
609,stolen-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,It's a toss-up as to what's the worse sin in this graceless piece of tragedy porn.
610,the-minus-man-movie,Glen Lovell,90,"The kind of muted, anything-but-obvious psychological thriller Hitchcock would have loved."
611,masculine-feminine-re-release-movie,Dave Kehr,90,"An excellent film, still as fresh as the day it was made."
612,all-about-steve-movie,Connie Ogle,0,"Insulting, witless comedy."
613,v-for-vendetta-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"First-time director James McTeigue's big, bold imagery, with slashing reds and blacks, is a close approximation of the novel's look and feel."
614,bridge-of-spies-movie,Steve Persall,83,Bridge of Spies is solid work but feels like Spielberg's best intentions as a filmmaker and world conscience on cruise control.
615,the-punisher-movie,Owen Gleiberman,16,The Punisher is a moronically inept and tedious piece of death-wish trash.
616,the-chamber-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"The Chamber has nowhere to go and it goes there slowly, flirting in all directions."
617,the-missing-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"Does not surpass Kevin Costner's ""Open Range"" for the title of Best Western of 2003, but it's a worthy effort and makes for an enjoyable (if slightly overlong) two-plus hours. "
618,baby-geniuses-movie,Elvis Mitchell,0,"One way to get through Baby Geniuses is to think about whether it really is the worst movie you've ever seen. Probably not, but pretty darn close."
619,big-night-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"By the end of the movie, we have been through an emotional and a sensual wringer, in a film of great wisdom and delight."
620,battleship-movie,Tom Russo,38,"If only there were more genuine rah-rah fun involved, instead of just endless, thudding, seen-it-all-before mayhem."
621,we-movie,John Anderson,20,The director's apparent blindness to the epic banality of her subjects suggests that the whole project is one royally misguided mess.
622,doctor-zhivago-movie,Peter Bradshaw,100,"It’s impossible not to be swept along and caught by the details: the pompous army officer falling into the barrel, the anarchist (played by a young Klaus Kinski) watching an old couple affectionately cuddling on the train, Zhivago himself suddenly shocked at his own haggard reflection in the mirror. Lean was hunting big game, and catching it."
623,juwanna-mann-movie,Russell Smith,11,"This is one that, like a 1am rerun of a late-season Cavs-Grizzlies matchup, deserves to play out in darkness and obscurity."
624,while-were-young-movie,Joe Neumaier,100,"Noah Baumbach’s sensational satirical drama While We’re Young is, finally, a movie for grownups to run out and see."
625,party-monster-movie,Marc Savlov,20,"A colorful mess, all style and substances and little else. "
626,i-melt-with-you-movie,Noel Murray,16,A movie about self-absorbed douchebags that wallows in their douchebaggery.
627,basic-instinct-2-movie,Lawrence Toppman,12,This script by the husband-and-wife team of Leora Barish and Henry Bean is hopelessly contrived and takes forever to get to the point. (I warn you: The film does not absolutely identify the killer.)
628,code-of-silence-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"The ads for Code of Silence look schlocky, and Chuck Norris is still identified with a series of grade-zilch karate epics, but this is a heavy-duty thriller - a slick, energetic movie with good performances and a lot of genuine human interest."
629,extremely-loud-and-incredibly-close-movie,Ann Hornaday,25,"There's a fine line between precocious and insufferable, and it's a line continually crossed by Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close."
630,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,Rene Rodriguez,12,"A sluggish, soporific dud, the dreariest big-budget science-fiction adventure since ""Dune."""
631,pure-movie,Nathan Rabin,70,"Pure loses a bit of its nerve in the home stretch, but Eden's unforgettable performance alone makes it a compelling portrait of a smart young boy forced to grow up way too fast."
632,art-school-confidential-movie,Rene Rodriguez,38,"Art School Confidential, the first disappointment from director Terry Zwigoff, is all glum, dour cynicism."
633,the-odd-life-of-timothy-green-movie,Joe Williams,38,"Kids are too smart to fall for it, and any grown-up who thinks that The Odd Life of Timothy Green is funny or heartwarming has a head made out of cabbage."
634,race-to-witch-mountain-movie,Kyle Smith,25,Bears all the signs of having been composed by an inferior race of alien screenwriters from the Hackulon System.
635,primary-colors-movie,David Edelstein,10,"I found it so oppressively smug that I had to get up and pace the aisles three or four times, and I'd have bolted if I hadn't been duty bound to stick it out."
636,the-lord-of-the-rings-the-return-of-the-king-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"Like all great fantasies and epics, this one leaves you with the sense that its wonders are real, its dreams are palpable."
637,the-code-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,Choose to pass this one up.
638,ice-age-dawn-of-the-dinosaurs-movie,Bob Mondello,75,"Unlike say, ""Monsters Vs. Aliens,"" which would have been nothing at all without its special-effects spectacle, this is a sweet little comedy, both family-friendly and centered on a nontraditional family, and so suitable for pretty much everyone."
639,moana-movie,Jesse Hassenger,83,"Occasionally, the movie’s combination of formula and tweaks makes it play like a one-blockbuster-fits-all reconciliation of a standard Disney checklist with a second list of corrective measures. For the most part, though, the movie feels more heartfelt than calculated."
640,abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-movie,Ty Burr,25,"A pox upon history and an insult to the 16th president of the United States. It's that, of course - actually, that's the point - but this joyless, deafening cinematic headache commits a different crime. It's a sin against entertainment."
641,barefoot-movie,Dennis Harvey,30,"If the film had a loopier or more fable-styled atmosphere, the concept might have seemed easier to swallow. But Fleming treats Stephen Zotnowski’s script with a glossy literalism that doesn’t do it or the actors any favors."
642,do-you-believe-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"Director Jonathan M. Gunn and screenwriters Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon are hard-pressed to provide the superfluous characters and situations sufficient depth, with the proceedings featuring enough melodramatic plot developments and homilies to fuel a religious soap opera."
643,how-to-lose-a-guy-in-10-days-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,0,"All in all, the only lesson here is how to irritate. This is a stupid movie for stupid people. If you're a stupid person, knock yourself out. Please"
644,friday-night-lights-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"The game footage is as engrossing as the real thing, although it comes at the expense of diminished attention to the teen players and their emotional problems."
645,look-at-me-movie,Lisa Nesselson,80,"Punchy dialogue, excellent thesping and a real feel for the universal tuning fork of great classical music make this a prime candidate for international arthouse play."
646,monsieur-ibrahim-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Tender but never sappy, Monsieur Ibrahim brings two people of vastly different age and background together in ways that are touching, and telling. It's a small, glowing gem. "
647,a-haunted-house-movie,A.A. Dowd,20,"This exceedingly lazy comedy is just the first of two ""Paranormal Activity"" parodies being crammed down our throats this year. The horror!"
648,the-witness-movie,Kate Erbland,83,"Although The Witness functions just fine as a true crime documentary in the vein of such en vogue offerings as “Serial” and “Making a Murderer,” the film makes its mark when it leans in on the deeply personal connection between its subject and its storyteller."
649,fences-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,88,"Fences is also very much an actors' movie, with breathtaking performances from Washington and his costars, including Davis, Stephen Henderson, Jovan Adepo, Russell Hornsby, and Mykelti Williamson."
650,primary-colors-movie,Rick Groen,88,Sophisticated and unsentimental political film.
651,fathers-daughters-movie,Katie Walsh,30,No amount of star power can save the script by Brad Desche.

653,vice-2015-movie,Oktay Ege Kozak,0,"Dull and lifeless, Vice fails on the promise of even its lowest ambitions."
654,shooter-movie,Richard Corliss,70,"Wahlberg could be the actor that action movies have been looking for since Sly, Arnold, Harrison, Bruce, Jackie and Jean-Claude -- all in their 50s or 60s -- got too old to execute the leg lifts necessary to kick bad guys in the butt."
655,vehicle-19-movie,Chuck Bowen,12,"As one incoherent action scene follows another, one's left staring at a film with nothing to respond to, waiting for it all to be over."
656,alien-3-movie,Bill Cosford,75,"This third (and, I would guess, last) installment does what few sequels do. It actually extends the story into its logical destination rather than merely recycling familiar characters and situations. It's not terrifying. It is an audacious first film. It is fully as dreadful as fans might hope. Don't miss it. [22 May 1992, p.G5]"
657,lost-boys-of-sudan-movie,David Sterritt,100,A riveting movie.
658,the-money-pit-movie,Staff (Not Credited),20,The Money Pit is simply the pits. There is really very little else to be said about this gruesomely unfunny comedy. Unofficial remake of the 1948 Cary Grant-Myrna Loy starrer Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House begins unpromisingly and slides irrevocably downward from there.
659,the-bucket-list-movie,Sean Axmaker,25,"The most insipidly innocuous film ever made about facing mortality and living it up before passing away, The Bucket List has as much poetry and poise as its clumsy, clunky title."
660,a-hijacking-movie,Joe Williams,88,"Director Lindholm is a graduate of the Dogma school, and he is able to maintain tension with a documentary camera technique, virtually no music and minimal on-screen theatrics."
661,the-wood-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,An across-the-board delight featuring a spot-on ensemble cast that treats the most awkward and embarrassing moments in the rites of passage with affectionate hilarity.
662,america-imagine-a-world-without-her-movie,Gabe Toro,0,"It's all fist-pumping anti-thought, consisting of baseless revisionist history and idle contrarianism."
663,turbo-movie,Roger Moore,63,"While small children may be enchanted by this little gastropod that could, adults will be more sorely tested. For all the horsepower Turbo boasts about, the movie tends toward the sluggish — as in slow as a slug."
664,rat-race-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"The funniest film to come along since ""South Park,"" and one that succeeds in a more difficult and satisfying way."
665,best-in-show-movie,Lawrence Toppman,88,"If this new film doesn't quite go to 11, it's a healthy 8½."
666,detachment-movie,Anthony Lane,80,"It is the greatest biblio-climax of any film since ""Fahrenheit 451,"" although Truffaut's prayer was that reading might yet survive calamity and carry the torch of the civilized.  Detachment snufffs out that faith; books it warns us, are the first thing to go.  [19 March 2012, p.91]"
667,the-master-movie,Damon Wise,100,"An often brilliant '50s-throwback character drama that never feels nostalgic, with terrific central performances and a luminous, unforgettable visual beauty. "
668,rollerball-movie,Mark Holcomb,0,McTiernan's Rollerball is a movie masochist's delight.
669,pain-gain-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Michael Bay's absurdist comedy is all pain, no gain and an utter monstrosity. It may be the most unpleasant movie I've ever seen, and I'm not forgetting ""Freaks,"" which Pain & Gain resembles, come to think of it."
670,200-cigarettes-movie,Peter Rainer,10,The film is filled with actors you want to see -- just not in this thing.
671,michael-movie,Desson Thomson,20,"After the disastrous ""Mixed Nuts,"" her last holiday season folly, Ephron appears to have hunkered down for a career of pandering mediocrity."
672,blind-shaft-movie,A.O. Scott,90,"Deftly swings to a spartan, engrossing climax, and the final twists spell out what the murderers are made of and the setting responsible for creating them. It is a true piece of film magic. "
673,alice-through-the-looking-glass-movie,Nick Schager,25,The off-putting aesthetics of ‘Looking Glass’ are complemented by an equally putrid tale that’s determined to make its protagonist loathsome. 
674,hope-floats-movie,Keith Phipps,30,"If there's one thing more heartbreaking than a crying child, it's a crying child wearing thick glasses, an image exploited numerous times throughout the course of the dull, uninvolving, tissue-thin Hope Floats."
675,marci-x-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"It's a dishonest satire that manages to be (disingenuously) contemptuous of white people and (unintentionally) condescending toward black people, without ever being funny."
676,her-movie,Michael Phillips,100,"A delicate, droll masterwork, writer-director Spike Jonze's Her sticks its neck out, all the way out, asserting that what the world needs now and evermore is love, sweet love. Preferably between humans, but you can't have everything all the time."
677,earth-to-echo-movie,Andrew Osmond,80,"Does for ""E.T."" what ""Super 8"" did for ""Close Encounters."" As lovably '80s as Reece's Pieces and pop socks."
678,the-wind-rises-movie,Lawrence Toppman,100,"The film is visually sumptuous, morally ambiguous, dramatic and dreamlike, with a narrative as engrossing as any live-action movie of 2013. It’s easy to follow yet hard to shake."
679,trembling-before-g-d-movie,Desson Thomson,70,Short but emotionally effective movie.
680,the-comedian-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,"The real problem, when all is said and done, isn’t the movie but the man with the microphone in its spotlight. Despite two comedy consultants who worked on the film, De Niro’s Jackie never comes across as especially funny on stage (or especially likable off). "
681,anger-management-movie,William Arnold,25,"A perfectly dreadful affair that makes no sense, has almost no good laughs and finally just sinks like a rock in a Beverly Hills swimming pool. "
682,pretty-persuasion-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,38,Sets out to be a social critique but settles for smug disdain.
683,searching-for-sugar-man-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,80,Malik Bendjelloul really knows how to spin a yarn.

685,being-elmo-a-puppeteers-journey-movie,Marsha Lederman,63,"The film is narrated by Whoopi Goldberg, who also shows up as an interviewee, and in a Sesame Street clip, which frankly feels odd. Worse: the script she has to work with is often lacklustre. "
686,drowning-mona-movie,Desson Thomson,10,I watched Mona. I felt like drowning.
687,sollers-point-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,75,"It transfixes, not with artifice or cheap sentiment, but with a strange alchemy of gloom and light. "
688,sugar-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"A moving, surprising and provocative baseball flick that rises immediately to No. 1 with a bullet on my personal list."
689,my-dead-boyfriend-movie,Christy Lemire,25,"A mixture of misplaced gallows humor, wildly over-the-top caricatures and a gimmicky use of animation combine to make My Dead Boyfriend one of the year’s more uncomfortable movie-going experiences."
690,the-hunt-for-red-october-movie,David Sterritt,25,"Like the nuclear sub it's named after, the picture is big, shiny, and expensive. It's also cold, hard, and cumbersome, and lacking the barest hint of emotional or psychological depth. [9 Mar 1990, Arts, p.10]"
691,bad-words-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"A young Jack Nicholson might have pulled this off, but Jason Bateman is not Jack Nicholson. Pity the actor who thinks he’s edgier than he actually is."
692,love-basketball-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"Lathan, charismatic and beautifully strong, holds the screen in every scene."
693,porto-movie,Rex Reed,0,A pretentious load of swill made in Portugal that should have been buried in a locked vault without a key.
694,kidnap-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,33,"Kidnap is an asinine child-abduction thriller spliced with a touch of the early Steven Spielberg TV movie ""Duel,"" and the most likable thing about it is that it is utter, unabashed garbage."
695,starsky-hutch-movie,Eric Campos,10,This tired old pile of garbage will hopefully be chased out of town soon.
696,the-birdcage-movie,Todd McCarthy,90,"Performed with matchless aplomb and made with plush professionalism, pic serves up pure pleasure from beginning to end."
697,enough-movie,Paul Malcolm,10,"Mechanical revenge fantasy that skirts every serious issue it raises along a slick, cynical trajectory."
698,short-term-12-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"Short Term 12 is a small wonder, a film of exceptional naturalness and empathy that takes material about troubled teenagers and young adults that could have been generic and turns it into something moving and intimate."
699,demonlover-movie,Ella Taylor,70,Nielsen beautifully embodies the sadness and confused sense of unreality that attend our appetite for the Internet's cheaper thrills. 
700,spider-man-3-movie,Michael Sragow,67,The sprawling canvas ultimately dwarfs the plucky title figure and makes him seem too small in every way.
701,last-train-home-movie,G. Allen Johnson,100,Fan has visual panache - Last Train Home has some gorgeously composed shots - but he also has something that can't be taught: The patience and understanding to allow a family to tell their heartbreaking story in their own way.
702,hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-movie,Dan Jolin,100,"A bit ""Up,"" a bit ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" a bit ""Midnight Run,"" even… Taika Waititi’s latest is an oddball treat of a mismatched-buddy pursuit move."
703,spring-break-movie,Gary Arnold,10,"It would be a grim day for the movies if every picture were as dignified as ""Gandhi,"" but that's no excuse for an indignity as craven and amateurish as Spring Break. [30 March 1983, p.B10]"
704,norbit-movie,Scott Tobias,0,"There's enough material here to add another hour to Spike Lee's ""reel of shame"" in ""Bamboozled,"" but hideously offensive black stereotypes are merely the tip of the iceberg."
705,west-of-memphis-movie,Philip Kemp,80,"A superbly detailed account of a notorious miscarriage of justice and how it was gradually unravelled. It's a tad overlong, but the passion, skill and revelations on display will captivate you."
706,topsy-turvy-movie,Peter Travers,90,The year's most beguilling and touching surprise. Bravo.
707,a-haunted-house-movie,Michael Nordine,12,"If you're wondering why A Haunted House exists alongside the upcoming Scary Movie 5 rather than instead of it, you may already have given the subject more thought than Marlon Wayans had hoped."
708,eureka-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"Slow -- sometimes maddeningly, soporifically so."
709,pootie-tang-movie,Mike Clark,25,"Only the makers of ""Freddy Got Fingered"" might crack a smile because it now has competition for worst movie of the year."
710,beasts-of-the-southern-wild-movie,Richard Corliss,100,"Mark down the date: June 27. That's when American moviegoers will see this perfect storm of a film, and the tiny force of nature that is Quvenzhané Wallis."
711,prevenge-movie,Matt Donato,90,"Prevenge is a breathtaking, savage debut from Alice Lowe, one that boasts horrific moral deprivation and a sense of humor drenched in maternal madness."
712,drop-dead-gorgeous-movie,Robert Horton,30,"Oddly enough, I'm enjoying the memory of these jokes more than I actually enjoyed watching the film."
713,survival-of-the-dead-movie,Joe Williams,38,A bland family-feud potboiler with no sign of the cook.
714,mercury-rising-movie,Lisa Alspector,10,The actors' serious faces are out of place in this hopelessly silly action conspiracy.
715,the-godfather-part-ii-movie,Richard Schickel,90,"This is a much colder film, with austere aspirations — not fully realized — to transcend its melodramatic origins and to become an authentic tragedy. … As Michael plots his careful, lethal moves, the recurring, unforgettable image is of his eyes growing colder, until they finally go dead to the horrors around him."
716,realive-movie,Nick Allen,25,"The movie is inescapably lifelessness, unintentionally dumbing itself down while desperately hoping to be profound. "
717,chronicle-2012-movie,Scott Tobias,83,"Chronicle becomes what ""Hancock"" wanted to be - a dark superhero story with firm footing in the everyday. Perhaps now the found-footage gimmick has been fully exploited; let us never speak of it again."
718,the-act-of-killing-movie,Matt Patches,79,The most gut-wrenching 'making of' documentary ever made.
719,the-details-movie,Eric Kohn,33,It's a familiar mold: the perils of suburban discontent have been so thoroughly explored that The Details plays like a hodgepodge of familiar circumstances on an assembly line to disaster.
720,chicago-movie,Jack Mathews,100,"At times, Chicago has the feel of a revue, with the major characters taking turns at their own show-stopping numbers. If it's too much of a good thing, I say, bring it on."
721,dheepan-movie,Jesse Cataldo,63,"Jacques Audiard's film struggles to overcome the burden of its over-simplified, moralizing setup."
722,lilya-4-ever-movie,Keith Phipps,70,What it became is essentially one long free-fall from destitution to despair. 
723,great-expectations-2013-movie,David Rooney,70,Vivid characterizations from Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter are the highlights of Mike Newell's traditional retelling of the classic Dickens novel.
724,the-roommate-movie,Roger Moore,25,"A timid thriller that manages a couple of mild jolts and a couple of creepy-cringe-worthy moments in its Variations on a ""Single White Female"" theme. "
725,white-noise-movie,Carla Meyer,25,A rather boring horror film.
726,sixty-six-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"It's labeled a ""true-ish story,"" and the results are cheeky fun."
727,dreamgirls-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"Dreamgirls is performed, shot, edited and packaged like a coming-attractions trailer for itself. Ordinarily that would be enough to sink a film straight off, unless you're a fan of ""Moulin Rouge."" But this one's a good time."
728,runaway-vacation-movie,Jami Bernard,63,"The funny thing about RV - no, it's not the jokes, which mostly bomb - is that the characters are actually pretty likable. It's an odd achievement for a road-trip comedy that wants desperately to be loved for its potty jokes, not its humanity."
729,all-about-steve-movie,Claudia Puig,38,Manages to be both toothless and tasteless in its satire of TV news sensationalism.
730,night-watch-nochnoi-dozor-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"A contemporary Russian movie that you could honestly call revolutionary, more for its style than its politics."
731,the-face-of-an-angel-movie,Glenn Kenny,38,To get at the heart of what’s wrong with The Face of an Angel all you need to do is consider the professional stones it takes to adapt the Amanda Knox case into yet another movie about the existential/amorous crises of a white male filmmaker. (And then have the nerve to dedicate the results to the memory of the murder-victim in the real-life case!) 
732,the-conspirator-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"This provocative account of a war-weary administration that denied Surratt her right to a fair trial starts slow but builds momentum in the scenes with Wright and Evan Rachel Wood as Surratt's flinty daughter, Anna."
733,10000-bc-movie,Dana Stevens,20,"In terms of character development, wit, and simple curiosity, it's dumber than a Neanderthal."
734,hostage-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,"But by the time Willis's character saves this considerably long day, it's filmgoers who will no doubt feel like prisoners, as a movie that promises to be a taut nail-biter devolves into the kind of silly, overblown climax parodied so beautifully by Robert Altman in ""The Player."""
735,ghost-town-2008-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,80,"Leoni and Kinnear are charming, and Koepp keeps the mood appropriately light. But really, this would be just another disposable comedy if it weren't for our unassuming star."
736,why-him-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"Why Him? takes a comic situation and then does everything it can to undermine it. It’s more than unfunny. It’s anti-funny. It doesn’t provoke laughter or even neutral silence, but an increasingly stunned disdain. It is the movie equivalent of putting on a plaster life mask and letting it dry and lock your face into an expression of blank misery."
737,aint-them-bodies-saints-movie,Rodrigo Perez,91,"Lowery is the real deal and understands filmmaking, and this is abundantly clear in this searing, romantic crime drama and love story."
738,little-nicky-movie,Jami Bernard,25,Crude and giggly.
739,i-love-you-beth-cooper-movie,M. E. Russell,8,"I was stunned to learn that ""Beth Cooper"" was adapted by former ""Simpsons"" writer Larry Doyle from his young-adult novel and directed by ""Harry Potter"" helmer Chris Columbus. Rarely have two seasoned Hollywood professionals produced something so painfully, amateurishly, relentlessly unfunny."
740,rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-movie,Richard Roeper,88,"This is a very “Star Wars”-y “Star Wars” movie. It’s not quite on the level of the original or “The Empire Strikes Back” (the best of ’em all, of course), but it’s on a par with last year’s “The Force Awakens” and it’s light years above “Attack of the Clones” and “The Phantom Menace.”"
741,winters-tale-movie,Rex Reed,25,"Movies get crazier and more incomprehensible every day, but you don’t know demented until you see Winter’s Tale."
742,jack-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,A listless family comedy and bland morality primer.
743,bottle-rocket-movie,Barry Walters,12,"Several times during this film, you wish you were a bottle rocket so you could explode out of your seat and leave this tedious mess behind. "
744,tyrannosaur-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"True, the stars are very good at what they do, but so what?"
745,no-such-thing-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,20,"Seems more theatrical than cinematic, needing the kind of direct address that only a stage can provide."
746,mamma-mia!-here-we-go-again-movie,Robbie Collin,80,The first film’s very specific pleasures are comprehensively encored.
747,gone-baby-gone-movie,Ty Burr,88,"The joke's on us, it turns out; as a director, Affleck has come through with a sharp, morally ambiguous piece of pulp crackerjack."
748,white-god-movie,Rene Rodriguez,100,"White God is the rare sort of movie in the era of computer-generated special effects where you can’t believe your eyes, because what you’re looking at is real. "

751,irreversible-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Whatever else it may be, Irreversible is disturbingly unforgettable. It is impossible to have a blasé reaction to a film this visceral. Indifference is not an option."
752,mcfarland-usa-movie,Bilge Ebiri,70,It comes by its emotions honestly and wins you over.
753,salmon-fishing-in-the-yemen-2012-movie,Ella Taylor,80,The crisply sweet banter and the halting intimacy that grows between two shy people with a common goal more than makes up for a wildly implausible plot. 
754,the-proposal-movie,Wesley Morris,38,"Neither (Bullock/Reynolds) brings out anything good in the other, and watching them try hurts the eyes, the tummy, and the libido."
755,into-the-abyss-movie,Bill Weber,88,"Underlying the occasionally harrowing, consistently mournful tone is a philosophy that, more than being explicitly anti-capital punishment, puts both family ties and the social contract at the center of people's self-worth."
756,the-cats-meow-movie,Charles Taylor,70,"If there were any justice in the world, The Cat's Meow would be the beginning of the rehabilitation of Davies' image."
757,robocop-2013-movie,Richard Jordan,80,"Taking the original and successfully transplanting it into an ambitious new world, José Padilha’s english-language debut is an exciting, pacey and thoughtful sci-fi actioner."
758,man-of-the-house-movie,Debra Birnbaum,12,"Mindless, vapid fare... Watching the movie, you'll feel really dirty."
759,spectre-movie,Steven Rea,75,"It's business as usual, even if that business is pulled off with brilliant precision, ingeniously choreographed action, and an itinerary boasting some of the most photogenic spots on Earth. "
760,super-troopers-2-movie,Staff (not credited),0,"Coming soon to a screen in hell’s multiplex is Super Troopers 2, a sequel that sets back Canadian-American relations to an 1812 level and retroactively awards an Oscar to ""Porky’s II"" and a Pulitzer citation to 1995’s ""Canadian Bacon."""
761,gerry-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,Gerry is ragingly bad art that contributes to a definition of independent film as something no one would want to sit through. 
762,actress-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"Mr. Greene’s impressionistic style and rough, off-center compositions create an atmosphere of intimacy, as if the viewer were being invited to read Ms. Burre’s diary or her mind."
763,the-in-crowd-movie,Jonathan Foreman,25,A laughably bad B-thriller.
764,national-security-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"Has many more downs than ups, but this ragged action comedy, with Martin Lawrence and Steve Zahn as mismatched buddies, rings some outrageously funny changes on a deadly serious genre of amateur video that began with Rodney King."
765,the-hottie-the-nottie-movie,Sam Adams,0,"It's not like Paris Hilton to rise above her material, but The Hottie and the Nottie sinks so low that all she has to do is stand upright."
766,dope-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"It’s a movie about a geeky teenager living in the Los Angeles hood, and something about it, or rather everything about it, feels real."
767,first-reformed-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,"In one of his best roles, Hawke is galvanizing as a man who has lost his way and is desperately searching for meaning in his life. And as Mary, Seyfried turns in a poignant and beautifully nuanced performance. Provocative and mesmerizing, First Reformed is a film that demands to be seen."
768,what-we-do-in-the-shadows-movie,Rosie Fletcher,80,"Sharp as fangs, warm as fresh blood, this could be the funniest movie of the year. New Zealand’s answer to Edgar Wright. "
769,punisher-war-zone-movie,Kyle Smith,0,"With its dopey fight scenes, grimy look and goopy gore, this movie is so far from ept that inept is the wrong word. It's anti-ept."
770,sabrina-1995-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"The new version is just as satisfying, if not as dry and cynical, as the original."
771,game-over-man!-movie,Clint Worthington,25,"Unfortunately, Game Over, Man! sacrifices all the brusque cleverness of their hit show for a warmed-over Die Hard parody that’s too self-indulgent to entertain anyone but the four goofballs who made it."
772,mother!-movie,Rex Reed,0,"Nothing about mother! makes one lick of sense as Darren Aronofsky’s corny vision of madness turns more hilarious than scary. With so much crap around to clog the drain, I hesitate to label it the “Worst movie of the year” when “Worst movie of the century” fits it even better."
773,tommy-boy-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,63,"A gentler adjunct to the dumb-buddy craze that's mostly inoffensive, save for a gratuitous bong-smoking scene. [31 Mar 1995, p.4D]"
774,bad-boys-ii-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,The vilest film of the season.
775,my-all-american-movie,Dan Callahan,0,"This is a movie that is confident in clean living, blinkered righteousness, and manly sentimentality, and it is shamed by some brief footage of the real Freddie at the end, an actual person whose story has been diminished by this slack, dawdling, offensive film."
776,almost-famous-movie,Richard Corliss,100,"So Almost Famous is almost fabulous. Oh, all right. The movie's so clever and endearing, you can forget the almost."
777,juwanna-mann-movie,Paul Malcolm,10,So what in this high-concept lame-a-thon makes screenwriter Bradley Allenstein think he can diss the Clippers?
778,halloween-ii-2009-movie,James Berardinelli,12,Halloween II is an affront to Halloween and horror fans. It's the kind of cataclysmic misstep from which a franchise cannot recover. It has transformed Michael Myers from an iconic movie monster into a laughingstock.
779,last-holiday-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,75,Latifah's performance and the film's gentle heart should prove enough to win over even the most churlish.
780,fat-albert-movie,Karen Heller,38,"Alas, this eternally sunny character's mantra, ""I don't have a problem, I solve problems,"" makes for paltry dramatic tension."
781,the-emperors-club-movie,Desson Thomson,90,"This isn't a stand up and cheer flick; it's a sit down and ponder affair. And thanks to Kline's superbly nuanced performance, that pondering is highly pleasurable."
782,proof-of-life-movie,Mike Clark,63,It's never enough of a grabber to keep the mind from wandering to the romance it apparently sparked.
783,surviving-christmas-movie,Jessica Winter,0,This ghastly comedy emits the subliminal whine of a sucking chest wound. 
784,shes-the-man-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,30,"Fails to exploit the myriad comedic possibilities, settling instead for broad, unconvincing slapstick aimed at 12-year-olds and gags Shakespeare would have rejected as ancient."
785,bobby-jones-stroke-of-genius-movie,Rick Kogan ,0,"It was Mark Twain who famously said, ""Golf is a good walk spoiled."" I'm telling you that Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius is 120 minutes wasted."
786,better-housekeeping-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"Plunges far beneath Todd Solondz's territory and enters the suburbs of John Waters' universe in its fascination for people who live without benefit of education, taste, standards, hygiene and shame. I"
787,america-imagine-a-world-without-her-movie,Rob Humanick,0,"Beholden to the same plethora of taboos, half-truths, and outright lies traded en masse by mainstream conservatism for the last seven years."
788,unfinished-business-movie,Robbie Collin,20,"Mawkishness, gay panic, and lazy jokes make Vince Vaughn's workplace comedy considerably less fun than work itself."
789,black-snake-moan-movie,Nathan Rabin,75,"Like ""Hustle & Flow,"" Moan succeeds on languid atmosphere and the conviction of its leads. But it'd be nice if the execution matched the startling audacity of its premise."
790,stealing-harvard-movie,William Arnold,25,Rarely has paper-casting worked as dismally as it does for Jason Lee and Tom Green.
791,mission-impossible-fallout-movie,Robert Abele,80,"At nearly two and a half hours, it’s designed to test your patience for the things that matter in these movies — violent confrontation, deception, jokey camaraderie, and over-the-top action — but it does so with a remarkably re-engaged fluidity of purpose."
792,shanghai-knights-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,Desperately unfunny action comedy.
793,it-movie,Tim Robey,80,"As a rattling ghost-train ride through sewers and derelict houses even David Lynch would think twice before exploring, the film toot-toots its way around at often deafening volume, but settles for doing only partial justice to King’s epic ambitions. Perhaps Muschietti has more of these stored up for the sequel, once an audience has gained faith that the scary stuff – petrifying, when it peaks – is well and truly in hand."
794,eros-movie,Desson Thomson,20,It doesn't seem like overstating things to say that Eros becomes steadily worse as it goes along.
795,house-of-fools-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,10,"His (writer/director Konchalovsky's) plunge into the world of mental distortion is so garish, so exploitative, that the picture needs only a few clicks of the dial to move from the horrible to the ludicrous"
796,meduzot-movie,Steven Rea,88,A beautifully strange movie.
797,beverly-hills-ninja-movie,Lisa Alspector,10,"It makes me sick all over again just describing this--the most affecting scene in a sluggish would-be comedy that reflects the dubious state of the art of fat male comedians exploiting themselves in 1997, the year its star died."
798,the-merchant-of-venice-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"It has greatness in moments, and is denied greatness overall only because it is such a peculiar construction; watching it is like channel-surfing between a teen romance and a dark abysm of loss and grief."
799,the-lunchbox-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,75,"Batra's film is ultimately less about love than about the vulnerability relationships place us in emotionally, and courage required to move past pain, and experience life again after we've been hurt. "
800,listen-up-philip-movie,Jeff Baker,91,A brilliantly flinty movie about writers angry at the world for failing to live up to their standards and recognize their genius.
801,only-god-forgives-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"Whether one thinks Only God Forgives is laughably awful — like, for instance, “Showgirls,” “The Color of Night” or “Battlefield: Earth” — or just plain terrible awful depends, appropriately, on how much you’re willing to forgive it."
802,peggy-sue-got-married-movie,Paul Attanasio,100,"Not since the heyday of Frank Capra, perhaps, has there been a movie that so seamlessly combines screwball comedy with get-out-your-handkerchiefs heart. Peggy Sue Got Married isn't about solving life's problems, it's about accepting them, in a world where love doesn't conquer all, but conquers enough. And in the hands of director Francis Coppola, that message makes what could have been merely a delightful lark about time travel into something much more."
803,hercules-the-thracian-wars-movie,Rob Humanick,12,"The film fluctuates haphazardly between semi-serious reverence and tongue-in-cheek camp, with no shortage of opportunities for the inevitable Rifftrax accompaniment."
804,lucky-numbers-movie,Gemma Files,20,"Ephron is still a director whose movies veer uncomfortably between the good -- make that adequate -- ""You've Got Mail"", the bad ""This Is My Life"" and the ugly Lucky Numbers. Pity."
805,the-avengers-movie,Keith Phipps,0,It's almost fascinating to witness just how lousy The Avengers really is.
806,king-arthur-movie,Mike Clark,63,"For better or worse, but surely satisfying novelty needs, Jerry Bruckheimer's King Arthur is set much earlier than usual and against the crumbling Roman Empire, which may even (or not) be historically legitimate."
807,mr-brooks-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,Mr. Brooks manages to be deeply loathsome -- no small feat for a film that's shallowly amateurish.
808,zero-days-movie,Stephen Holden,90,Zero Days has a similarly balanced outlook along with a critical political viewpoint that avoids hysteria and demagogy. Its strongest protest is against what Mr. Gibney sees as the dangers of excessive American secrecy.
809,nasty-baby-movie,Alan Zilberman,37,"Ultimately, Silva’s uneven command of tone undoes whatever goodwill his actors have managed to generate. They — and we — deserve much better than this."
810,bird-on-a-wire-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,"Bird on a Wire is far from inept-every one of those car chases is masterfully staged. Still, for most of two hours you’re pummeled with formula; it would be hard to name another movie at once so proficient and so dull. When a director as talented as Badham reaches this state of empty craftsmanship, who can say whether he’s working out of boredom or cynicism? At this point, there may be very little difference."

812,skin-trade-movie,Chuck Bowen,0,"There's no beauty to this film, little rhythm, none of the physical grace that action-film fans crave even if they don't know they do. "
813,young-mr-lincoln-movie,Nick Schager,90,"Exuding nobility, modesty, and down-home wit, Henry Fonda assumes the iconic top hat as America’s 16th president in Young Mr. Lincoln. Far from a traditional decades-spanning biopic, John Ford’s drama instead provides a snapshot of a moment in Lincoln’s life."
814,the-pillow-book-movie,J. Hoberman,10,"The Pillow Book's pretentions are boundless, for all its desperate fashion and layered imagery, it's a staggering bore-as vacantly petulant as Kate Moss's stare. [10 Jun 1997]"
815,blue-caprice-movie,Kyle Smith,88,"Blue Caprice takes a minimalist, documentary-style approach that proves harrowingly effective."
816,entourage-movie,Chris Nashawaty,75,"Entourage, the show and the movie, is about five insanely lucky knuckleheads who have each other’s backs in a town that’s more likely to stab you there. "
817,a-family-man-movie,Gary Goldstein,10,"Alternately crass and treacly, overbearing and under-finessed, the film, penned by headhunter-turned-screenwriter Bill Dubuque and directed by Mark Williams, is on life support from get-go."
818,shaun-the-sheep-movie-movie,Jordan Hoffman,80,"From the company that gave us “Chicken Run” and “Wallace and Gromit,” this adorable tale about a sheep who leads his comrades on a big-city adventure is some of the most pure visual storytelling you’re going to see this year."
819,the-boy-next-door-movie,Drew Taylor,0,"A limp psychosexual thriller that takes a promisingly trashy conceit... and does absolutely nothing with it, and saddles it with wooden performances, poor staging, and a complete lack of conviction. It reaches a nearly operatic level of ineptitude. "
820,green-room-movie,Chris Nashawaty,91,"Part of being in a punk band involves having to play some pretty hostile venues. But the one in writer-director Jeremy Saulnier’s new white-knuckle thriller, Green Room, makes the typical mosh-pit dive look like a kindergarten run by nuns."
821,it-follows-movie,Scott Tobias,90,Mitchell’s deft handling of the relationships in It Follows gets threaded into an ingenious and exceedingly skillful creepshow.
822,paris-36-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"So shameless in its pandering, sentimental vision of Frenchness as to constitute something of a national embarrassment."
823,they-came-together-movie,Rex Reed,0,A ponderous spoof of movie rom-coms that plummets stupidity to a new low even by Hollywood standards.
824,distant-voices-still-lives-movie,Jay Carr,88,"It's a stunningly stylized, fiercely emotional one-of-a-kind film that seals in amber the horrors of a life the director couldn't wait to escape. [18 Sep 1988, p.96]"
825,endless-love-movie,Michael Phillips,38,A movie just begging to go up in the flames of camp. If only somebody had brought a match.
826,surviving-christmas-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,10,"A lame comic premise, a tiresome-bordering-on-obnoxious protagonist and a script devoid of humor is a lot to overcome for any movie, and Surviving Christmas is not the one to do it. "
827,2-fast-2-furious-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"A video game crossed with a buddy movie, a bad cop-good cop movie, a Miami druglord movie, a chase movie and a comedy. It doesn't have a brain in its head, but it's made with skill and style and, boy, is it fast and furious. "
828,major-payne-movie,Desmond Ryan,25,"No fewer than seven writers were recruited to create the story and screenplay for Major Payne, a textbook demonstation of how more can produce less - in this case, a comedy that has all the brio and wit of an army training manual on personal hygiene. [27 March 1995, p.D02]"
829,seeking-a-friend-for-the-end-of-the-world-movie,Marc Mohan,91,"Predictable, contrived, sappy and, ultimately, against all odds, remarkably fulfilling. "
830,casino-movie,Richard Schickel,80,"So long as Casino stays focused on the excesses -- of language, of violence, of ambition -- in the life-styles of the rich and infamous, it remains a smart, knowing, if often repetitive, spectacle."
831,curse-of-the-golden-flower-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"A period spectacle, steeped in awesome splendor and lethal palace intrigue, it climaxes in a stupendous battle scene and epic tragedy."
832,damsel-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"Wasikowska struggles to activate a vague notion of female disenfranchisement and victimhood, triumphant. She and Pattinson fill in as many blanks as they can, where they can."
833,silverado-movie,Jay Scott,38,"The manipulative Star Wars-style score is the only novelty on tap in Silverado, which has a plot too drearily complicated and arid to summarize and an attitude almost unbearable in its dryly smirky assurance that it knows what you want from a Western, which is to say, action that never quits, emotion that's never felt, characters that are never real and situations that are never sensible. [10 Jul 1985, p.S7]"
834,johnny-english-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"This is strictly dull chuckles from dull wits, and while there are a few genuine laughs to be found amidst the dross, they’re as rare as Francophiles in Crawford, Texas."
835,bride-wars-movie,Connie Ogle,25,"An insipid comedy in which the women are shallow, acquisitive, backstabbing, selfish harridans."
836,grindhouse-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"We need filmmakers who can move us forward even as they maintain a sense of the past. To that end, Grindhouse captures a bit of rowdy movie history in a bell jar."
837,the-warren-files-movie,Manohla Dargis,90,"The dread gathers and surges while the blood scarcely trickles in The Conjuring, a fantastically effective haunted-house movie."
838,bachelorette-movie,James Berardinelli,0,"I don't often use the words ""godawful"" and ""abomination"" to describe a movie, preferring to reserve such terminology for extreme instances when I feel duped and mortally offended. Case in point: Bachelorette."
839,congo-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,"All I know is that something has gone terribly, drum-beatingly wrong in Congo (Paramount, PG-13), and you can sense Jungle Trouble brewing from the git-go."
840,the-foot-fist-way-movie,Robert Wilonsky,70,"Truthfully, The Foot Fist Way is no different from an episode of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"": This is irritainment, something you snicker at while covering your eyes, praying that this guy never gets loose in the real world, when, in fact, he's your next-door neighbor. Or you."
841,are-we-there-yet-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,"All too effectively conveys the claustrophobic horror of being shackled in a small space with two whiny, hateful children."
842,breakfast-of-champions-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,A movie so unhinged it practically dares you not to hate it.
843,croupier-movie,Stephen Schaefer,88,"A tiny treasure: grown-up, tight, sexy, suspenseful and with a mildly ambiguous wrap-up that stimulates the mind rather than confusing it."
844,we-the-animals-movie,David Rooney,90,"In his first narrative feature, documentary maker Jeremiah Zagar (In a Dream, Captivated: The Trials of Pamela Smart) captures the feel of the novel with uncanny precision, notably in the visceral charge and physical heat of tightly wound bodies almost constantly moving in close proximity."
845,nothing-but-the-truth-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,Competently constructed and nicely acted by Kate Beckinsale and Vera Farmiga.
846,loves-labours-lost-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"KEN, KEN, KEN, not another Shakespeare, pleeeeeeez."
847,mothers-day-2016-movie,Peter Sobczynski,12,"None of the actors are able to find a way to rise above the material, instead just plowing through in the broadest manner possible while trying not to look too obviously embarrassed. "
848,lost-in-la-mancha-movie,Michael Sragow,88,"This documentary could have been a simple downer. Instead, it's a giddy, manic-depressive roller coaster - because it brings us eye to eye with Gilliam."
849,hercules-1997-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"The wonder is that it took Disney so long to get to the gods of Greek mythology. Hercules jumps into the ancient legends feet-first, cheerfully tossing out what won't fit and combining what's left into a new look and a lighthearted style."
850,fair-game-movie,Joey O'Bryan,11,"Very slick and extremely silly, not to mention aptly titled, Fair Game is just that - a noisy actioner so inanely scripted, acted, and directed that it practically begs you to make fun of it."
851,we-are-marshall-movie,Stephen Cole,63,"An enjoyable time-waster, distinguished by an unexpectedly sharp comic turn by McConaughey, lots of boisterous horseplay and some stirring emotional clinches. All in all, an entirely serviceable night out for buddies looking to locate hidden feelings."
852,towelhead-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,The result is a movie about the many forms of social and sexual abuse that does not make the abusee a victim but victor.
853,mr-deeds-movie,A.O. Scott,20,"Mr. Deeds is mostly terrible, a shambles of a comedy that looks as if it was shot by a tabloid news crew."
854,asylum-movie,Michael Phillips,63,"Natasha Richardson glides through the film version of Patrick McGrath's novel Asylum in various states of fear, desire and undress, a swan among Yorkshire frumps."
855,meeks-cutoff-movie,Steve Ramos,100,"Epic in scope, and featuring a powerful lead performance by Williams, Reichardt does justice to the myth of the wagon train settlers and makes a Western every bit as beautiful and poetic as Terrence Malick's ""Days of Heaven,"" and thankfully a bit more energetic."
856,clowntown-movie,Matt Donato,30,Even those who are deathly afraid of clowns will have trouble finding enjoyable bouts of horror in this survival thriller.
857,mumford-movie,Peter Stack,100,"So wonderfully odd, even spiritual, that audiences won't be able to do anything but smile."
858,kafka-movie,Staff [Not Credited],30,"The story ultimately feels too conventional, and the portrait of the artist is too shallow to stand as a compelling or convincing evocation of a complex mind."
859,i-love-you-phillip-morris-movie,Peter Travers,75,"It's one crazy love story, but Carrey and McGregor make it work by making us buy the romance as the real thing. There's something about these Marys that pulls you in. "
860,me-myself-irene-movie,Lisa Alspector,30,A kind of idealist fantasy that seems almost hamstrung by its plot.
861,summer-catch-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,Can only be enjoyed with a skullful of Old Bohemian and a faceful of high school crotch.
862,all-is-lost-movie,Eric Kohn,91,The movie is an impressively realized work of minimalist storytelling that foregrounds Redford's physicality more than any other role in his celebrated career. His performance defines the movie to an almost shockingly experimental degree.
863,sammy-and-rosie-get-laid-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"For people who love London and yet are thoughtful about it, this film is indispensable."
864,cruel-intentions-movie,B.J. Sigesmund,70,You won't be able to resist the film's ribaldry and cynicism.
865,post-grad-movie,Staff (Not credited),25,"A promising premise simply devolves into just another ""Definitely, Maybe"" or ""The Proposal."""
866,sin-city-movie,Stephen Hunter,100,Two hours and six minutes has never seemed so much like two and six-tenths seconds. It's pure pulp metafiction.
867,men-of-honor-movie,Dennis Lim,30,The filmmakers at once coarsen and dilute a fascinating life into a lumpy puddle of punishing inspirational hokum.
868,o-movie,Peter Rainer,30,"It's a doomy dirge of a movie, in which the protagonists, or at least the actors who play them, aren't equipped to handle their outsize passions."
869,rise-of-the-guardians-movie,Leah Churner,30,"Kids who can stomach mixed holiday fare should be able to ride out this stereoscopic superstorm of snowglobes, Easter eggs, magic portals, enchanted crystals, moon worship, fruitcakes, matryoshka dolls, and lost teeth. Others may be confused."
870,shrek-the-third-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,67,I love the princess squad.
871,i-am-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"At the end, as Shadyac proclaims, ""I stopped flying privately"" (well, hurrah for you, Mahatma), renounces his Pasadena mansion and moves into a trailer park, the results of his epiphany grow funnier than any of his movies."
872,steve-jobs-movie,Eric Kohn,83,"While at times too over-the-top and operatic for its own good, those same flawed ingredients echo the rough edges that define the movie's iconic subject.  "
873,mimic-movie,Barbara Shulgasser,25,If there is a reason anyone would voluntarily agree to make this movie it probably dwells somewhere in a realm only accessible to the thinking of ambitious actors.
874,standing-in-the-shadows-of-motown-movie,Mark Caro,88,"Gordy barely is mentioned, even though he was the artistic leader who presumably profited most from the Funk Brothers' labors. Discussing Motown solely through the prism of the musicians is like assessing Picasso's works on the basis of the paint quality."
875,fresh-movie,Gene Siskel,88,"Fresh is Boyz N the Hood meets Searching for Bobby Fischer. Key to the success of the film is the solemn performance by young Sean Nelson. We stare at him in much the same way as we gazed upon that little girl in the red coat in Schindler's List, a human face walking through a tragedy."
876,napoleon-dynamite-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"There is a kind of studied stupidity that sometimes passes as humor, and Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite pushes it as far as it can go."
877,the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"It's not brazenly bad or heroically bad or stridently bad. It's bad in all the old, dull ways of being bad: poor performances, absurd story, dreary special effects, witless dialogue and the excessive length of someone taking himself far too seriously."
878,behaving-badly-movie,David Ehrlich,20,"As fresh as a stiff tissue and even less appealing, the film takes its cues from so many disparate sources, it almost feels like an accidental spoof."
879,captain-corellis-mandolin-movie,Michael Sragow,88,"Although it's in the same genre as ""The English Patient,"" it's a vastly better movie --more surprising and original, more rigorous and sympathetic. This film is oddly shaped. It is also heartbreaking and exhilarating."
880,one-night-at-mccools-movie,Wesley Morris,0,A shamelessly dumb movie.
881,paranoid-park-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Paranoid Park has the slightly glum insularity of minimalist fiction, but it's the first of Van Sant's blitzed-generation films in which a young man wakes up instead of shutting down."
882,undisputed-movie,Rene Rodriguez,63,"Isn't exactly memorable, and as far as its prison setting goes, it has nothing on HBO's infinitely more brutal ""Oz."" But as late-summer time killers go, you could do worse."
883,house-of-the-sleeping-beauties-movie,J.R. Jones,0,"Glowna presents this smoky German feature as an elegy for lost youth, but it's so tumescent with male self-pity that I couldn't wait for it to end."
884,flirt-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,[Hartley] changes the script enough so that the integrity of his experiment goes out the window. But he doesn't change enough so that the narrative can have any suspense.
885,rush-movie,Manohla Dargis,90,"Mr. Howard doesn’t just want you to crawl inside a Formula One racecar, he also wants you to crawl inside its driver’s head."
886,the-cook-the-thief-his-wife-her-lover-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"If there's anything disgusting or grotesque that The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover doesn't dabble in, I'm at a loss to figure out what it is. This film, a wildly exuberant, bitingly satirical examination of excess, bad taste, and great acting, is the kind of over-the-top experience that will have timid movie-goers running (not just walking) for the exits. Taboos? If director Peter Greenaway has any, you can't tell by this film."
887,ballets-russes-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,"It's a profoundly optimistic and delightful movie, for balletomanes and neophytes alike. It made me happy for days afterward."
888,scream-4-movie,Steven Rea,63,"For genre geeks, this can be fun - although nothing in Scream 4 is quite as clever as the filmmakers seem to think it is."
889,stigmata-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"By the time the credits roll and a disclaimer informs us that there may, in fact, be a lost gospel of Jesus and that it is being suppressed by the Church, all we can think to say is, ""Ah, shaudup!"""
890,the-medallion-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"One of the Peking Opera-trained superstar's most mediocre films, rivaling last year’s God-awful ""The Tuxedo"" for sheer messy filmmaking and brazen acts of tedium... Abysmal."
891,exiled-movie,Wesley Morris,75,"This intriguing story, like many tales of mid-20th-century American art, is fueled by testosterone."
892,sorry-to-bother-you-movie,Ty Burr,100,There are a lot of reasons to be thankful for Sorry to Bother You — one being that it represents the return of the inspired/demented midnight-movie satire — but the rise of Lakeith Stanfield to leading man status is probably the most satisfying.
893,a-united-kingdom-movie,Stephanie Merry,63,"Although the relationship lacks a certain fire, the acting is superb."
894,sideways-movie,Peter Rainer,100,"Sweetest, funniest, most humane movie I've seen all year."
895,class-movie,Vincent Canby,30,"The movie can't make up its mind whether it's a lighthearted comedy, set in what appears to be a posh New England-style prep school just outside Chicago, or a romantic drama about a teen-age boy who has a torrid affair with his roommate's mother. Either way it's pretty awful."
896,the-amati-girls-movie,Robert Koehler,20,Most discomforting of all is the sight of world-class actors stuck in such threadbare material.
897,american-beauty-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"Though excellent in many ways, American Beauty is, finally, an uneasy mix of assured technique and simplistic satire."
898,the-do-deca-pentathlon-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"It shares one annoying practice with their other early films: They like to use distracting little zooms in and out for no reason at all, except possibly to remind us the film is being shot with a camera."
899,the-hottie-the-nottie-movie,Keith Phipps,0,"How is Paris Hilton in her first starring role to receive a national release? Pretty bad, actually. She's limited to a single, all-too-familiar expression of smug self-satisfaction, and she delivers her lines in a tone somewhere between ""seductive"" and ""dish-soap commercial."""
900,the-skulls-movie,Maitland McDonagh,30,"Dopey ""thriller."""
901,dear-john-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,Dear John is the sort of movie that gives tearjerkers a bad name.
902,philip-roth-unmasked-movie,A.O. Scott,80,"Fittingly enough, given that his great subject has always been himself, it is Mr. Roth who dominates the screen...He is, for 90 minutes, marvelous company — expansive, funny, generous and candid."
903,butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid-movie,Staff (Not Credited),10,"Every character, every scene, is marred by the film's double view, which oscillates between sympathy and farce."
904,song-one-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,This is a sweet-tempered and small movie that’s not remotely trying to be hip. 
905,dirty-love-movie,Richard James Havis,0,This banal comedy is filmmaking of the lowest order.
906,a-good-day-to-die-hard-movie,Claudia Puig,38,The best thing about A Good Day to Die Hard is its title. 
907,indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,20,"Mechanical, soulless."
908,mud-movie,Ty Burr,63,The most striking aspect of Mud is the air of myth and tall-tale telling that hovers lightly over the settings and characters.
909,the-raid-2-movie,Chris Nashawaty,83,The Raid 2 will make you feel like Christmas came nine months early. Some action sequels don't know when to say when. But here's one where too much is just the right amount.
910,the-libertine-movie,Michael Wilmington,63,"It's a bit too muddy, dismal-looking and smoky to beguile us, too fixated on filth and too dreary-looking to really shock us."
911,alpha-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,63,"Sweet, strange and at times slightly scary."
912,bamboozled-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,"Angry, fitfully provocative mess."
913,batman-robin-movie,Liam Lacey,0,"Campy costumes can't disguise the incoherent plot, confused performances and lame script that send this star vehicle spiralling downward."
914,virus-movie,Marc Savlov,0,It's dead in the water.
915,a-night-at-the-roxbury-movie,James Berardinelli,12,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is so boring and pointless, that those faithful movie-goers who never walk out on a film have to find some alternative to watching the mind- numbing stupidity unfolding on the screen."
916,legend-of-the-guardians-the-owls-of-gahoole-movie,Scott Bowles,75,"The film is surprisingly deft and entertains at both the adult and juvenile levels. If something in Guardians catches your eye, trust your gizzard."
917,what-if-2014-movie,Joe McGovern,33,"An unctuous rom-com that runs its characters through every plastic cliché of a pre-Oscar McConaughey vehicle, ultimately causing us to root against the vacuous couple and their predetermined happy ending."
918,thats-my-boy-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"Never underestimate the importance of guy-on-guy sentimentality in the Adam Sandler universe. It's his way of making his fans feel as if he's high-fiving them, or maybe giving them a group hug. But Sandler, bottom line, is too good at playing louts like Donny to spend this much energy getting us to like them."
919,the-incredible-burt-wonderstone-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Alan Arkin does the best trick, bringing a dollop of humanity to the role of Rance Holloway, the magician who was young Burt's inspiration. Apart from Rance, the whole production is slovenly nonsense, photographed on the cheap with blaring ghastliness. Yet it poses an intriguing mystery. Did the producers appeal to a denominator even lower than common by making their film as dumb as possible, or did it just turn out that way?"
920,the-trumpet-of-the-swan-movie,Jan Stuart,30,"Nothing quite works about The Trumpet of the Swan, one of those animated films that make you realize how hard it is to strike the right tone for a family film."
921,simon-birch-movie,Stephen Holden,0,No doubt there are those who will deem Simon Birch ''heartwarming.'' It is exactly the kind of movie that has given that hackneyed superlative a bad name. 
922,black-rose-movie,John DeFore,0,A cross-cultural buddy-cop flick so bottom-of-the-barrel it would've been hooted off screens even when such things were in commercial demand.
923,the-queen-movie,Keith Phipps,91,"Mirren begins the film having her portrait painted, looking every inch the monarch and proud to play the part. By the end, she's let the pressure of one week, and maybe a lifetime, show in her eyes."
924,intolerable-cruelty-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"The results have the Coens' usual tartness most of the way, before turning soft and gooey at the center."
925,the-lady-and-the-duke-movie,Kenneth Turan,80,"Just as interesting, if not more so, is how Rohmer integrates his very contemporary concerns into a period drama, how he creates characters who manage to be true to our times as well as their own."
926,a-love-song-for-bobby-long-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Macht is the best thing in A Love Song for Bobby Long, but his intelligent performance doesn't justify a tough, and very long, sit."
927,big-fat-liar-movie,James Berardinelli,25,"A lame collection of dumber-than-dumb gags, the quality of Big Fat Liar is on par with that of the worst television sit-com gorged to four times its normal size."
928,unsane-movie,William Bibbiani,78,"Unsane is a creepy little thriller, with a concept that could terrify just about anybody, and a plot that wobbles but ultimately stays on the rails. Claire Foy gives a standout performance and Steven Soderbergh’s intimate visual style sells the idea that we are watching something horribly sinister get revealed."
929,junebug-movie,Peter Debruge,88,"That rare kind of movie that contrasts ""cultured"" big-city characters with devout, ""simple"" folk without being condescending or judgmental of either camp."
930,alice-through-the-looking-glass-movie,Justin Chang,30,"At every turn the filmmakers have simplified, banalized and sentimentalized Alice and her psychological landscape in ways that reek of ignorance at best and cynicism at worst. "
931,nobel-son-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"The plot twists are mostly predicated on the characters' improbably shifting loyalties, the sort of thing you can get away with only when the people in your movie are drained of all compassion."
932,new-york-minute-movie,Marrit Ingman,0,"The kind of winking, disingenuous youth comedy that tries to play it both ways, dangling the twins as fetish objects and then yanking them back on the leash because, you know, this is a family film."
933,casa-de-mi-padre-movie,Diego Semerene,0,"You know a film isn't going to be considered high art when the guy to your left at the press screening is a reporter from Extra and the guy to your right lets out a loud ""That's awesome, man"" after each scene. "
934,the-center-of-the-world-movie,Kevin Thomas,20,"All this sadness becomes so depressing to watch, testing the limits of the patience of even a viewer prepared to take Wang's underlying concerns seriously."
935,premium-rush-movie,Steve Persall,83,"Working in tandem they (Gordon-Levitt/Shannon) make Premium Rush a movie that's off the chain, as the kids say. "
936,under-siege-movie,Gene Siskel,88,"For its first hour is as exciting an action picture as the Die Hard films. The tension and humor level tail off a bit toward the conclusion, but Steven Seagal and Chicago director Andy Davis clearly declare themselves as top-flight talent."
937,wrath-of-the-titans-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,12,"The only reason you'll feel any wrath is because you shelled out 12 bucks for this steaming bucket of half-baked plot, cliched dialogue and disappointing 3-D special effects."
938,left-behind-2014-movie,Bilge Ebiri,10,Left Behind is biblical in its silliness.
939,watchmen-movie,Keith Phipps,75,"Snyder's Watchmen keeps moving so assuredly, it's nearly impossible not to get swept along."
940,songcatcher-movie,Jean Oppenheimer,80,Combines strong feminist sensibilities with surprisingly old-fashioned melodrama.
941,rat-race-movie,Steven Rea,12,"Somnambulistic pacing, kerplunkingly unfunny jokes, and mugging thespians making fools of themselves. Truly torturous spectacle."
942,dior-and-i-movie,Steven Rea,88,Tcheng finds Simons in moments of haughty self-confidence and tremulous self-doubt.
943,citizen-kane-1941-movie,Edwin Schallert,90,"Citizen Kane does occasionally sink to dullness because of its reiterations, notwithstanding it can be classified as, in a number of aspects, one of the most arresting pictures ever produced."
944,town-country-movie,Kevin Maynard,10,"It's ""Shampoo,"" 30 years after. What a surprise, then, that this effort ranks lower even than the Steve Martin remake of ""The Out-of-Towners."""
945,geostorm-movie,Alissa Wilkinson,10,"Even though no movie that lends itself to individually tailored special effects should be a royal snoozefest, it’s 2017 and everything is awful, and so, too, is Geostorm, a disaster movie without a disaster and an apocalypse flick lacking the apocalypse. "
946,et-the-extra-terrestrial-re-release-movie,David Sterritt,75,"Doesn't make it a masterpiece, but it's fun. [2002 re-release]"
947,jason-x-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,A protracted and only sporadically imaginative menu of ways to be murdered.
948,the-triplets-of-belleville-movie,David Sterritt,100,"Children may enjoy it, aside from the youngest, who might find it too weird for comfort. Its main audience is adults, though. And not just any adults, but those in the mood for venturesome fare that's both surreal and hilarious."
949,capote-movie,Ella Taylor,90,The triumph of Capote is that it both grants and shares with him that twisted brew of obsessive identification and monstrous detachment that is the fertile burden of the artist.
950,runaway-bride-movie,Hal Hinson,30,"Marshall is the very definition of a hack; his one and only desire is to play to the lowest common denominator. This is the secret of his success: He aspires to mediocrity. With Runaway Bride, he has scored another bull's-eye."
951,in-the-cut-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"Ryan radiates neither desire nor terror. She's freeze-dried in a world of lifelessly abstract feminine fear, and so is the movie."
952,that-awkward-moment-movie,Scott Foundas,30,The pic falls well short of its efforts to combine the raucous vulgarity of the “Hangover” movies with Cameron Crowe-ish depth of feeling.
953,the-guru-movie,Howard Cohen,38,"Swami says, “Steer clear of The Guru, a dismally dumb sex comedy, lest you waste $9 and 90 minutes of your life you will never get back.''"
954,the-post-movie,Chris Nashawaty,83,"If you look at The Post next to something like All the President’s Men, you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it. That’s a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film. But it’s also the difference between a very good movie and a great one."
955,fresh-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Fresh takes the setting and tone of Boyz 'N the Hood and Menace II Society and applies it to a thriller. Gone is the documentary-like quality of filmmaking as well as the gritty sense of immediacy. Fresh uses higher-quality film stock and a more traditional cinematographic style to distance the audience ever-so-slightly from the characters. This way, it's easier to appreciate the complexity of Michael's plan and the manner in which he arranges his masterful scheme of manipulation."
956,driven-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"Redundant, humorless and overlong screenplay."
957,spread-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,"A witless homage to ""Shampoo"" and ""American Gigolo"" that's brain-dead on arrival."
958,sin-city-movie,William Arnold,0,"The attainment it achieves is in the depths of pointless, mean-spirited exploitation."
959,dogville-movie,David Denby,10,"What Lars von Trier has achieved is avant-gardism for idiots. From beginning to end, Dogville is obtuse and dislikable, a whimsical joke wearing cement shoes.  [29 March 2004, p. 103]"
960,the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-movie,Peter Rainer,80,"Smashing for much of the way; as a piece of fantasy moviemaking, franchise-style, it beats the bejesus out of ""Harry Potter."""
961,chloe-and-theo-movie,Frank Scheck,10,A deadly earnest polemic whose good intentions are smothered by its inept execution. 
962,the-women-movie,M. E. Russell,25,"Is there anything more depressing than when middlebrow filmmakers decide to remake bona fide classics that did not, under any circumstances, need to be remade?"
963,what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting-movie,Eric Hynes,10,"For all the fear, loathing, and overthinking that Murkoff's bedside text engenders, its journey ends with the hopeful beginning of a new life, whereas the movie leaves you hoping for a swift end to your own."
964,the-tortured-1969-movie,Rex Reed,25,A nasty piece of work that's been hanging around for two years looking for an audience. 
965,the-heart-is-deceitful-above-all-things-movie,Ty Burr,12,The Heart Is Deceitful wants to cauterize us into feeling something -- anything -- but it's far too heartless to know what.
966,life-itself-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,88,"Life itself, that loaded two-word phrase, is what Roger really wrote about when he wrote about movies. "
967,jupiter-ascending-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,16,"There is an emptiness that lingers around Jupiter Ascending. From the lack of original thought in its conception to the expensive excess in its execution, the directors' usual bag of tricks can't manage to fill the void. "
968,sarahs-key-movie,Rex Reed,75,Director Gilles Paquet-Brenner has done an elegant job of reducing a complex piece with many components into a riveting narrative that grabs you by the lapels and refuses to loosen its grip.
969,the-red-violin-movie,Bob Graham,75,"Some will say this film is overly ambitious, but what the hell. The man put five years of his life into making this epic mystery. We can surely give it two hours of ours."
970,lady-bird-movie,David Sims,95,"Lady Bird isn’t a movie about any searing issue; it’s just a wonderful, rare character study of a young woman figuring out her identity, and all the pitfalls that follow."
971,the-other-sister-movie,Russell Smith,30,"There's little to recommend this movie, which is part and parcel with Marshall's schlock-dominated body of work."
972,tomcats-movie,Carla Meyer,0,"Offers only tired jokes, grimace-worthy physical comedy and bad, bad acting."
973,dopamine-movie,Ellen Fox,63,"The moody, distinctively San Franciscan Dopamine has other charming little touches -- its humor, its characters, its city life -- that make you want the film to succeed. It doesn't entirely; it's more likable than it is good."
974,trance-movie,Kim Newman,80,"Though it rings ever so slightly hollow as cool shades into callousness, this exercise in sexy suspense and brain-scrambling mystery is a dazzling, absorbing entertainment which shows off Danny Boyle’s mastery of complex storytelling and black, black humour."
975,national-treasure-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"Isn't any fun at all, which is ultimately the most damning thing you can say about a Bruckheimer movie. "
976,the-dark-horse-movie,Peter Debruge,90,"The Dark Horse is as good a title as any for a film that takes an overplayed genre — the inspirational mentor story — and still manages to surprise, sneaking up to deliver a powerful emotional experience within a formula we all know by heart"
977,mom-and-dad-movie,Richard Roeper,75,"It’s a funky, violent, nasty exploitation film, highlighted by a performance of operatic madness by the one and only Nicolas Cage."
978,the-fighter-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"Visionary director David O. Russell so deftly weaves the family's story that we, too, are initially seduced by Dicky."
979,the-wedding-movie,Neil Smith,20,"The Big Wedding isn’t telling a story so much as selling a lifestyle – one that, rather like Heigl’s morning sickness, makes you want to vomit."
980,letters-from-iwo-jima-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"Letters From Iwo Jima, takes audiences to a place that would seem unimaginable for an American director. Daring and significant, it presents a picture from life's other side, not only showing what wartime was like for our Japanese adversaries on that island in the Pacific but also actually telling the story in their language. Which turns out to be no small thing."
981,looper-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Late in Looper, when a highly telekinetic kid starts levitating things, it really does look like Christopher Nolan had wandered onto the set and taken over."
982,paul-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"The movie, despite what you may have gathered from the goofy trailer, is more sweet than silly."
983,afterlife-movie,Betsy Sharkey,10,"The afterlife is not, however, nearly as deadly or as ghastly as the movie itself, an undertaking so tortured that it digs a deeper grave with every passing scene."
984,dungeons-dragons-movie,Dana Stevens,10,Take this as a warning: it's not much fun.
985,the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,30,"Nothing anchors the lighter-than-air story as it drifts away under the direction of Stephen Norrington (""Blade"") into an FX stratosphere where wit, character and vigorous storytelling cease to matter."
986,monsters-university-movie,Steve Persall,75,"The movie is mostly fun and ultimately disposable, which is a letdown after Pixar's previous greatness."
987,tomcats-movie,John Patterson,10,Grotesque and ugly.
988,the-little-traitor-movie,Roger Moore,75,"An engaging Israeli film about the days when the people throwing rocks, assassinating soldiers and setting off bombs were Jews out to carve a state for themselves out of the British ""mandate"" in Palestine."
989,coco-before-chanel-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"Coco is played by Audrey Tautou, and she's phenomenal--self-contained, tightly focused, sparing with her smiles, miserly with her joy, often guarded to the point of severity, yet giving off a grave radiance at every moment she's in front of the camera."
990,spanglish-movie,David Denby,30,"Spanglish chokes on an excess of sincerity and guilt, and, in retrospect, its failure may turn out to be momentous for a sincere and guilty community--Hollywood liberals in a state of post-election dismay."
991,lovely-amazing-movie,Kim Morgan,75,"About how women see themselves in terms of bodies, age and careers, but without all the ""you go girl"" tripe crammed into so many other movies of this ilk."
992,the-fountain-movie,M. E. Russell,100,"It's an ambitious, passionate, grief-stricken work of film art."
993,festival-in-cannes-movie,Rick Groen,63,"Festival in Cannes is definitely Jaglomesque, but can't get that tricky balance right -- the result is a picture as charmingly insubstantial as the world it invokes."
994,abandon-movie,Steve Davis,30,"What hath ""The Sixth Sense"" wrought? These days, it seems as if every psychological thriller has a surprise finish."
995,the-chronicles-of-narnia-the-voyage-of-the-dawn-treader-movie,Richard Mowe,80,"Michael Apted opts for a certain dated and mannered appeal with a whiff of nostalgia for more innocent times, which lends added enchantment. "
996,house-of-d-movie,William Arnold,25,"As a director, Duchovny is in big trouble every frame of the way. His characters ring false, his scenes seem improperly motivated in a glaring way, and his distasteful obsession with imagery of unflushed cigarette butts bobbing in a toilet is beyond inexplicable."
997,pride-prejudice-movie,Stephen Hunter,80,"Lord God, can she take control of a scene, dominate a movie, project to the last seat, radiate power and personality unto the rafters. It's a great performance. I love the way Knightley's eyes light with furious intelligence when she cuts the pompous Darcy a new something or other."
998,bad-boys-movie,Rita Kempley,30,"Relentless formulaic fodder for the explosion-starved; it's loud, shallow, sexist and a complete waste of time."
999,the-amityville-horror-movie,Wesley Morris,25,The latest cannibalization of a popular older horror film.
1000,the-kings-speech-movie,Ian Nathan,100,"Think the blazing joys of ""Chariots Of Fire"" where the race is to the end of a sentence. Can it be that the British are coming?"
1001,the-expendables-movie,Anthony Lane,10,"The Expendables is savage yet inert, and breathtakingly sleazy in its lack of imagination."
1002,storytelling-movie,Paula Nechak,16,"While there are maybe two moments of genuinely clever humor, Storytelling is the work of a previously promising filmmaker who, having no new ideas, has morphed into a sniggering schoolboy intent upon being mean."
1003,intimate-strangers-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"Such a triumph of simplicity, subtlety and tact--and of the eroticism in words, looks and glances--that the actors ravish us with sheer talent and intelligence."
1004,44-pages-movie,Chris Packham,70,"Anyone who’s worked in editorial or a similar environment will recognize the staff’s focus, creativity, and sharpness."
1005,let-it-ride-movie,Rita Kempley,30,Pytka's marginally successful at setting this gambler's fantasy against the Damon Runyonesque aspects of the horsy life.
1006,toy-story-3-movie,Ann Hornaday,75,"Lasseter and his team plunge the audience into a collective case of empty- nest syndrome, with a dash of mortal terror thrown in for grins. And again, they make it work."

1011,showtime-movie,Charles Taylor,30,"Isn't particularly assaultive, but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase, explosion or gunfight again."
1012,flash-of-genius-movie,Tasha Robinson,75,"It's a smart movie for grownups, an increasingly rare commodity."
1013,the-haunted-mansion-movie,Owen Gleiberman,33,"Tame and witless enough to make me long for the ancient, dusty fright kitsch of ''The Munsters.'' "
1014,it-movie,Gary Thompson,63,"You almost wish the movie had jettisoned the horror elements entirely, and converted It into what it feels like it wants to be — something more like King’s Stand By Me, with a teen girl in the mix."
1015,the-walk-movie,Joe Neumaier,100,The Walk is a visionary high-wire act.
1016,west-side-story-movie,Philip K. Scheuer,100,I daresay most spectators will also find the pull of this film irresistible. The — hardest — problem faced by its adapters must have been one of intangibles — how to make an essentially ballet-opera form believable as realistic cinema — and they have all but licked it. West Side Story never quite shakes off an aura of pretentiousness but its portentousness is stronger and that is all to the good.
1017,up-movie,Perry Seibert,100,"You get the feeling that, had Pixar been in business 25 years ago, Steven Spielberg might have made this movie for them as a follow-up to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."""
1018,solaris-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"The Soderbergh version is like the same story freed from the weight of Tarkovsky's solemnity. And it evokes one of the rarest of movie emotions, ironic regret."
1019,against-the-ropes-movie,Laura Sinagra,30,"As a gloves-off Erin Brockovich, Ryan never makes it into the ring."
1020,love-friendship-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,It's a joy to watch Beckinsale attack the material — Lady Susan is one of those people whose interest in themselves and their own well-being is so great that it becomes contagious.
1021,breaking-and-entering-movie,Rick Groen,63,"Minghella is a smart guy with splendid intentions but, ultimately, he's a victim here of his own liberal contrivances."
1022,shut-up-sing-movie,Peter Travers,88,"For three years, the camera focuses on the Chicks as wives, mothers, entertainers and political flash points. Their fight to stay uncompromised is inspiring."
1023,gods-not-dead-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,Any just God would likely recoil from the ham-fisted and spurious defense put forth in this film.
1024,barton-fink-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,10,"Billed as a comedy, but it could also be billed as a drama, a satire, an allegory, or a film (partially) noir. It wouldn't matter, or help... Not since Robert Altman has any American filmmaker been as overrated as this pair. [30 Sept 1991]"
1025,viola-movie,Calum Marsh,100,"The world the film describes is so vividly realized that it seems to spill over the edges of the frame, as if the lives of its characters will continue after the credits roll."

1028,closed-circuit-movie,A.A. Dowd ,75,"Closed Circuit may be little more than a high-minded, shrewdly topical gloss on a shopworn genre, but its cynicism is bracing."
1029,i-am-another-you-movie,Eric Kohn,83,"Shot over the course of several years, the movie blends an intimate perspective with trenchant investigative chops, uncovering a transitory figure whose romantic ideals give way to a harsh reality check."
1030,with-all-deliberate-speed-movie,Ken Ringle,30,Misses almost every opportunity to break new ground on the issue.
1031,king-kong-movie,Stephen Hunter,100,Jackson's big monkey picture show is certainly the best popular entertainment of the year. The film is a wondrous blend of then and now: It honors its mythic predecessor of 1933 while using sophisticated movie technology to seamlessly manipulate the fantastic.
1032,kangaroo-jack-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"There are two distinctive features to the movie: the mind-numbingly banal plot as one chases another who chases another, and all the offensive material."
1033,bewitched-movie,Ken Tucker,30,"Kidman is stuck in this pomo movie about the making of a TV-show remake. It’s ""Being John Malkovich for Morons."""
1034,amelie-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"A charmer, a movie whose embrace of cinema is so passionate it could be mistaken for an embrace of life."
1035,love-ranch-movie,Gary Goldstein,30,"The grand Mirren is, truth be told, miscast and Pesci is misdirected as Grace and Charlie Bontempo."
1036,15-minutes-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"Herzfeld also wrote the screenplay, and so its leaden and obvious tone and the resulting dearth of delicacy rests squarely on him."
1037,congo-movie,Steve Davis,0,"Jawdroppingly bad, this adaptation of Michael Crichton's 1980 novel about a talking ape named Amy and a fabled lost city deep in the jungles of central Africa is as sophisticated in execution as a Jungle Jim movie."
1038,pride-and-glory-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,Pride and Glory would be risible if it weren't so reprehensible.
1039,winters-tale-movie,Peter Travers,0,Winter's Tale is preposterous twaddle. 
1040,heartbreak-ridge-movie,Pauline Kael,10,This movie is offensive on just about every level.
1041,reds-movie,Alex von Tunzelmann,90,"An engrossing, beautifully filmed and remarkably balanced portrait of a fascinating moment in history, cleverly enhanced by the intercutting of real-life documentary interviews. Reds is everything a historian could want in a movie."
1042,omar-movie,Sheila O'Malley,88,"Omar is a thriller and a romance, with unabashedly melodramatic elements (there's even a love triangle), all of which are brought into stark relief by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "
1043,welcome-to-collinwood-movie,Megan Lehmann,63,"Doesn't have the polish of ""Ocean's Eleven"" - but it does have George Clooney."
1044,sophies-choice-movie,Dave Kehr,20,"The picture is completely devoid of cinematic interest, adopting instead a tiresome theatrical aesthetic in which showy monologues are filmed in interminable, usually ill-chosen long takes."
1045,the-club-movie,Robert Abele,70,"Larraín, who wrote the movie with Guillermo Calderón and Daniel Villalobos, approaches the material like a scientist both fascinated and cynically bemused by how a particularly virulent sickness operates."
1046,3000-miles-to-graceland-movie,Kenneth Turan,10,"One of those movies that makes you want to throw up your hands in despair, disgust, or maybe both."
1047,the-brady-bunch-movie-movie,Steve Persall,67,"Like The Flintstones and The Beverly Hillbillies before it, The Brady  Bunch Movie is an amusing facsimile of a pop culture archetype. If only the script had been given such attention to detail. [17 Feb 1995, p.3]"
1048,le-divorce-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"In this episodic film with a soupcon of ""Sex and the City"" (just as the Merchant Ivory Slaves of New York presaged the HBO hit), cross-cultural misunderstanding, not character, is the point."
1049,jack-and-jill-movie,Jaime N. Christley,12,"If the result is a movie that seems like a much slicker, more condensed, and speedier version of the Sandler comedies that have guaranteed his grandkids' retirement, count it as a blessing that it's over quickly. Not without pain, but quickly."
1050,terminator-genisys-movie,Jake Cole,38,Terminator Genisys feels like being trapped in a conversation with a child breathlessly recounting the highlights of the preceding movies.
1051,georgia-rule-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"WARNING: Do not take your mom to Georgia Rule unless she's Roseanne Barr. You may expect a three-generational chick flick, but what you get is a child-rape comedy."
1052,the-amati-girls-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"Although the concept seems promising enough, it is undone by disastrous casting decisions and an utter lack of ensemble unity."
1053,the-man-from-uncle-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"It has taken Warner Brothers ten years to get this property a new life and, thankfully, the results in no way resemble those of its Cold War TV compatriot. Or, to put it another way, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) is good fun, which ""The Avengers"" (1998) wasn't."
1054,tape-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,"Tape may not be a great movie, but it's a great demonstration of creativity within severe limitations."
1055,new-jack-city-movie,Janet Maslin,80,"The film's flamboyant portrait of Nino may be stereotypical, but Mr. Snipes makes it chilling."
1056,pretty-persuasion-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,"The movie wants so badly to be mentioned in the same breath as ""Heathers"" or ""Election"" that it's not even funny. Really, I mean it, this charred-black comedy is not even funny."
1057,sex-the-annabel-chong-story-movie,Wesley Morris,25,"When Annabel Chong sits in front of Gough Lewis' camera and complains about her need to have one of those normal everyday lives, you want to tell her that having intercourse on camera with more than 200 men is probably not the way to get to normal."
1058,aimee-jaguar-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,Färberböck's sensual adaptation is a matter of fact embrace of the unconventional and dangerous during a terrible time.
1059,chasing-liberty-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,"An endless, virtually laugh-free pastiche of Aaron Sorkin by way of Aaron Spelling, Chasing Liberty features Mandy Moore trying so strenuously to be the next America's Sweetheart that she almost pops a vein. "
1060,chips-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"The investigation is dull, the jokes dispiritingly flat-footed, with Ponch’s sex addiction and squirminess over male intimacy supplying most of the setups for CHIPS’ puerile humor."
1061,the-duke-of-burgundy-movie,Chuck Bowen,88,"Peter Strickland charges full-tilt into the objectifying whims of his fantasies in order to somehow reach the other end of perception, which acknowledges the ultimate empathetic limitations of said fantasies."
1062,the-mothman-prophecies-movie,Michael Wilmington,38,"A gaudy yet grim science-fiction horror movie of such surpassing silliness, humorless intensity and stylistic overkill that watching it may actually put you in a state of paranoia."
1063,the-comedian-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Why did Mr. De Niro do it, and why would anyone pay money to see it?"
1064,nights-in-rodanthe-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"It's no wonder the faithful continue to forsake the movies, given junky embarrassments like Nights in Rodanthe."
1065,monsters-ball-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,80,Well redeemed by its dank atmosphere and cracker-barrel performances.
1066,cassandras-dream-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"Instead of offering a perspective that, at the very least, laments a world where the flow of money hurts otherwise good people, Allen simply pushes the movie into an uncertain sinkhole between morality play and black comedy."
1067,wild-tales-movie,Alonso Duralde,92,Wild Tales represents the work of an exceedingly skillful storyteller.
1068,crazy-horse-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"The picture is celebratory, in its own quiet way, as well as clear-eyed. "
1069,would-you-rather-movie,Sara Stewart,0,"Would you rather . . . watch this movie, or spend an hour and a half having your arm hairs plucked out with a rusty pair of tweezers? I’d have chosen the latter if it’d been on offer. "
1070,passion-play-movie,Robert Abele,10,"Inexplicably filmed in a handful of styles - including, bizarrely, obviously processed shots - by cinematographer Christopher Doyle, Passion Play would be midnight-movie fodder if it weren't so drearily wrapped up in its wounded-male aesthetic and a clumsy approach to art-movie moodiness that was abandoned in the '80s."
1071,black-panther-movie,Conor O'Donnell,83,"While Ryan Coogler’s deep dive into the titular character’s Wakandan homeworld keeps the assembly line working, it heralds not only an improvement on the MCU, but a striking and grandiose fantasy in its own right."
1072,new-years-eve-movie,Roger Ebert,25,New Year's Eve is a dreary plod through the sands of time until finally the last grain has trickled through the hourglass of cinematic sludge. How is it possible to assemble more than two dozen stars in a movie and find nothing interesting for any of them to do?
1073,last-days-movie,David Ansen,90,A hauntingly beautiful tone poem.
1074,the-master-of-disguise-movie,Claudia Puig,25,"Lacking even a hint of humor or a watchable story, Disguise has distinguished itself as the summer's worst movie."
1075,mystic-river-movie,Shawn Levy,100,Eastwood has crafted one of the most powerful American dramas in years. 
1076,the-family-movie,Adam Markovitz,67,"Doesn't just wink at De Niro's history, it leans on it, hard."
1077,44-inch-chest-movie,Peter Travers,25,There's a difference between exposing misogyny and crassly exploiting it.
1078,undertow-movie,Rick Groen,63,"Green may be right to avoid the melodramatic waves of the conventional thriller. But, if so, he needs to dive a lot deeper than this -- there's just not enough under in Undertow."
1079,license-to-wed-movie,Peter Rainer,0,A sham.
1080,audition-movie,A.O. Scott,80,"The picture is about victims -- but it's also a great, sick rush with a kicker on the level of ""The Vanishing."""

1083,duets-movie,Kenneth Turan,30,"By the time Duets faces the music, hardly anyone is going to care."
1084,the-amityville-horror-movie,Peter Travers,25,"Result? It's not scary, just busy."
1085,selena-movie,Duane Byrge,80,"What makes this movie work is Jennifer Lopez's electric performance as Selena, capturing the charismatic aspects of Selena's stage persona and the essence of her maturity as a growing woman."
1086,no-mans-land-movie,Jean Oppenheimer,100,"Tanovic describes it as ""a very serious film with a sense of humor."" It is an apt description for a very remarkable film, one of the best of the year."
1087,i-daniel-blake-movie,Robert Abele,70,"When I, Daniel Blake regrettably piles it on at the end, it’s Loach growing weary of humanizing details and desperate to shake you up with consequences, didacticism and speechifying. It’s the finger-pointer in him, but as this movie frequently shows in its best moments, he’s still a practiced veteran at open-arms affection for the dignity of the downtrodden."
1088,big-fish-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"Big Fish is a clever, smart fantasy that targets the child inside every adult, without insulting the intelligence of either. "
1089,rules-of-engagement-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"The clichés lap like bay waves, from the salutes to the brotherly brawl to the olive-oil tear streaks semipermanently painted down Jackson's cheeks."
1090,religulous-movie,Kenneth Turan,30,"Though he claims to be a seeker, someone who ""has to find out"" why believers believe, Maher sets out not after answers but cheap laughs that preach, so to speak, to the converted."
1091,the-family-man-movie,David D'Arcy,0,What were they thinking?
1092,man-of-the-year-movie,Keith Phipps,33,"If there's anything sadder than a satire without teeth, it's a thriller without thrills. Even sadder is the rare movie that fails at both genres simultaneously. That, and that alone, makes Man Of The Year exceptional."
1093,xxx-state-of-the-union-movie,William Arnold,25,"Has to be one of the most absurd of all big-budget action movies, and that's saying something. It's just a blink away from over-the-top self-parody, and I'm pretty sure it's not trying to be."
1094,the-green-hornet-movie,Peter Rainer,0,Such a feeble excuse for an action comedy that it's already taken pride of place in my upcoming worst-movies-of-2011 list.
1095,joe-versus-the-volcano-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"There’s something weirdly innocent about Shanley’s ineptitude: He seems to be inventing the oldest cliches for the very first time. The movie doesn’t really hit bottom, though, until he has Ryan deliver an ickily earnest monologue about how her character is ”soul-sick.” I think she means, ”Pass the Pepto-Bismol."
1096,boys-dont-cry-movie,Mark Caro,88,"A stirring, emotionally true testament to foolish bravery as well as shameful evidence of the severity with which it is so often punished."
1097,arthur-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"Attempting to fill Dudley Moore's top hat in Arthur, Russell Brand rapidly descends the rungs of the comedy ladder from ""unfunny"" to ""irritating"" to ""vulgar"" to the bottom one - ""Andy Dick."""
1098,the-ring-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"It's an utter waste of Watts; there's not a trace here of the talent on display in Mulholland Drive, perhaps because the script doesn't bother to give her a character."
1099,fargo-movie,Desson Thomson,90,Frances McDormand enjoys the comedic role of her career.
1100,see-you-in-valhalla-movie,Frank Scheck,10,"Featuring stereotypical characterizations and painfully awkward dialogue, the film treats its dramatic themes with a wince-inducing shallowness. Virtually nothing in the drawn-out proceedings works on any level, and the characters are so inherently unlikeable that being in their company is as painful for viewers as it is for them."
1101,102-dalmatians-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"So dull and formulaic, it ought to be leashed and led directly to the doghouse."
1102,the-limits-of-control-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Jim Jarmusch's Dada meander, shot by Christopher Doyle, is empty and excruciating -- that's really all you need to know."
1103,point-and-shoot-movie,Simon Abrams,38,Point and Shoot consequently feels like a film made by a storyteller — not a journalist — who doesn't know he can ask follow-up questions.
1104,someone-like-you-movie,Kim Morgan,16,"Surprisingly bland even within its dubious genre of ""chick flick."""
1105,i-love-you-man-movie,Richard Corliss,70,The picture is worth catching for the delicate and toxic nuances of Rudd's performance. And one of its funniest corollaries is that it shows how hilarious and instructive a star this perennial supporting player can be.
1106,colors-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"A special movie - not just a police thriller, but a movie that has researched gangs and given some thought to what it wants to say about them."
1107,year-one-movie,Rick Kisonak,10,This is shtick that’s minimally a generation past its expiration date.
1108,the-curious-case-of-benjamin-button-movie,Steven Rea,75,"Question: Is life still like a box of chocolates if you're going in reverse? The answer, in the case of the curiously Gumpian The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, is a gooey yes."
1109,hansel-and-gretel-witch-hunters-movie,Roger Moore,38,Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is more Gatling guns and grenades than The Brothers Grimm. 
1110,the-cove-movie,Bob Mondello,85,"Psihoyos describes his troops as a kind of ""Ocean's 11"" team, and that's apt enough: He's making a real-life action caper, a heist with potential consequences in the real world. The buildup to getting the shots they want has a good deal of natural tension. And the payoff -- well, let's just say it's devastating."
1111,life-partners-movie,Jesse Hassenger,83,"If this all sounds more than a little familiar, it’s probably because similar material about young-ish women growing up and maybe apart has been staged recently and on a variety of scales, from the scrappy intimacy of ""Frances Ha"" to the broader comedy of ""Bridesmaids."" Life Partners isn’t as ebullient as the former or laugh-out-loud funny as the latter, but it maintains a sharp specificity about both of its lead characters’ lives. "
1112,knucklehead-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,20,A distinctly shameless and shoddily made family comedy.
1113,ghosts-of-girlfriends-past-movie,Melissa Anderson,0,"Above all, it will make you long for a day when studio movies about relationships feel like they are by and for adults who have actually been in one."
1114,the-uninvited-movie,Glenn Whipp,30,Without dwelling on the limited abilities of novice British filmmakers Tom and Charles Guard (a.k.a. the Guard Brothers) -- who seem to have divvied up duties here by having one sibling focus exclusively on close-up shots of doorknobs and the other oversee everything else -- the movie's fatal flaw is the undeveloped relationship between the two sisters.
1115,the-misguided-movie,Katie Walsh,10,"Nibali and Galati deliver their lines in matching monotones, in scenes that are simply deadening. None of the trio of leads has the presence to carry the film, though Mihaljevich displays a flicker as the dangerous sociopath Wendel. Alexander's limited style doesn't help these performances either, nor does the wildly underwritten script. "
1116,steamboy-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"If Victorian Manchester had been remotely like this, H.G. Wells never would have bothered to pen ""The Time Machine"" – he'd have just stepped outside and into the fray."
1117,the-november-man-movie,Kyle Smith,12,This one resembles a James Bond film about as much as Belgrade resembles London.
1118,hot-tub-time-machine-2-movie,Richard Roeper,25,"Given the considerable comedic talents of Rob Corddry, Craig Robinson, Adam Scott et al., and the ragged, what-the-hell charms of the original “Hot Tub Time Machine,” it’s surprising how rotten this movie is from start to finish."
1119,untitled-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"Those willing to meet (Untitled) even part way will discover a comedy of intelligence and wit, with some strong performances."
1120,georgia-rule-movie,Staff (Not credited),30,"Another flabby big-screen sitcom from ""Happy Days"" creator Garry Marshall."
1121,the-ladies-man-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"One of the most deadly dull ""SNL"" spinoffs."
1122,taxi-2015-movie,Glenn Kenny,63,"Panahi’s latest act of defiance is entirely commendable on a number of levels, but I regret to say that from my own perspective, Taxi is the weakest of the films he’s made since he was enjoined from making them."
1123,ghosts-of-girlfriends-past-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,A junky-looking romantic comedy that’s neither remotely romantic nor passably comic.
1124,london-road-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,90,"The artifice of the form works something wondrous with the material, highlighting the generic nature of our response to extreme violence."
1125,the-fantastic-four-movie,A.O. Scott,30,"This Fantastic Four, directed by Josh Trank from a script he wrote with Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, feels less like a tale of superhero beginnings than like a very long precredit opening sequence."
1126,vampires-kiss-movie,Peter Travers,0,"The bloodsuckers in this thriller may not have much bite, but here's a movie that can -- it's guaranteed -- drain the life out of an audience in minutes."
1127,the-human-centipede-first-sequence-movie,Frank Scheck,0,Crosses the line from horror to just plain sick.
1128,king-kong-1933-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"Kong is an exaggeration ad absurdum, too vast to be plausible. This makes his actions wholly enjoyable. "
1129,manglehorn-movie,Jessica Kiang,83,"For filmmaker and actor, even on those occasions when Manglehorn’s risks do not pay off, we have to credit the courage and confidence it took to attempt them; but more often than not they pay dividends and the result gently dazzles."
1130,jackie-ryan-movie,Stephen Holden,70,"It uses a terrific score of bluegrass and old-timey songs, many of them written by Nick Hans, to underscore the connection and to evoke a fundamental American spirit epitomized by traveling musicians with banjos, fiddles and guitars."
1131,dungeons-dragons-movie,Scott Foundas,10,Stunningly bad sci-fi/fantasy hokum.
1132,last-days-movie,Dennis Lim,100,The brilliant concluding chapter in the death trilogy that inspired Gus Van Sant's artistic rebirth.
1133,the-hoax-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"Gere is terrific at suggesting the kind of addictive cocktail of excitement, panic, chutzpah, creativity, and naked hunger for fame and megabucks that might inspire such big, fat lies."
1134,take-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,A dreadfully misguided movie.
1135,no-way-out-movie,Jay Boyar,100,"A thriller that grabs you even before the ironies of its plot kick in is a thriller you don't want to miss. No Way Out is that sort of movie, a thriller that's thrilling throughout."
1136,from-paris-with-love-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,20,"Both mean-spirited and self-conscious. It's all style and no soul, which wouldn't be a problem if its style at least gave us something to look at, or to laugh at. But From Paris With Love, filmed on location in Paris, has a raggedy, greasy, dingy look: It's the movie equivalent of an unbathed, unshaven French boyfriend (the bad kind). It thinks it's suave, but it just smells bad."
1137,mother!-movie,Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,83,"It’s a dizzying, sadistic feature, and may well be Aronofsky’s most biting work since Requiem for a Dream, but it’s also concerned with some deeply painful and humane material. Where that film aimed for repulsion of a literal bent, however, Mother! is far more concerned with horrors of the allegorical variety."
1138,sunshine-state-movie,Peter Rainer,70,The usual Sayles mix of torpor and talent prevails here.
1139,i-am-big-bird-the-caroll-spinney-story-movie,Randy Cordova,80,"The movie is fascinating when it looks at the mechanics of Big Bird, which are physically challenging."
1140,movie-43-movie,Robbie Collin,20,"After watching Peter Farrelly’s Movie 43, I was immediately overcome with a sudden rush of emotion: not amusement, anger or even mild irritation, but a profound and faintly tragic sense of pity."
1141,what-if-2014-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"What If is a case of the cutes the way the Black Death was a case of infectious disease. The movie is saturated with cute, teeming with cute, rancid with cute. I’d endured all a man could fairly be expected to take when I glanced at my watch and realized there were still 95 minutes to go."
1142,frances-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Jessica Lange plays Frances Farmer in a performance that is so driven, that contains so many different facets of a complex personality, that we feel she has an intuitive understanding of this tragic woman."
1143,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,Ron Stringer,10,A stinker.
1144,a-hard-days-night-re-release-movie,Frank Lovece,90,"Refreshing, innovative and immensely funny."
1145,whitney-movie,Randy Cordova,90,"It's clear-eyed and remarkably honest, and Macdonald shows a flair for illustrating how Houston's life fits in the bigger picture"
1146,heist-2015-movie,Stephen Whitty ,20,"So, Bobby, seriously, what the hell is happening? You got a new movie, or what you’re billing as a movie, except it's already on cable and I figure a month from now it'll be in one of those Redbox things. And it's called Heist, I guess because it wants to separate me from my money."
1147,barneys-great-adventure-movie,Nathan Rabin,25,Barney's Great Adventure will bore adults to tears.
1148,dreamgirls-movie,Maitland McDonagh,88,"Murphy is a revelation as James, and what American Idol castoff Hudson lacks in technical acting craft she makes up for in raw energy and a voice that could melt the rhinestones off a beauty queen. To complain that Beyonce pales by comparison is to fault her for nailing the essence of the infinitely malleable Deena."
1149,one-day-2011-movie,Ty Burr,25,"A miscast, underwritten, drably directed adaptation of a very popular novel, it's the feel-bad film of the summer and an almost perfect example of how not to turn a book into a movie."
1150,her-movie,Scott Foundas,100,"What begins like an arrested adolescent dream soon blossoms into Jonze’s richest and most emotionally mature work to date, burrowing deep into the give and take of relationships, the dawning of middle-aged ennui, and that eternal dilemma shared by both man and machine: the struggle to know one’s own true self."
1151,the-virginity-hit-movie,Stephen Cole,25,"The Virginity Hit is another slice of ""American Pie,"" one more youth comedy that encourages its cast (and audience) to ridicule a fumbling, well-meaning teenager. "
1152,borgmcenroe-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,67,"Just as many sports movies before have done, and many more will after, Borg/McEnroe shines a light on the sacrifices necessary to achieve greatness. It’s just a shame that the movie itself doesn’t have the same ambition"
1153,shutter-island-movie,Scott Tobias,91,"There’s a purpose to all this madness--though to talk about the primary reason the film succeeds would be giving the game away--but it should be appreciated first as a vivid, waking nightmare."
1154,hot-pursuit-movie,Ann Hornaday,12,"There isn’t one joke, sight gag or piece of slapstick tomfoolery that lands with any success or originality in Hot Pursuit."
1155,soapdish-movie,Jay Carr,38,"Soapdish should have been a laugher. But this new spoof of TV soaps isn't nearly as funny as the real thing. Soapdish holds only the merest sliver of entertainment. [31 May 1991, p.28]"
1156,the-forgiveness-of-blood-movie,Eric Kohn,83,"The Forgiveness of Blood examines the barriers of ritual and the passage from youth to adulthood in Albanian society with the perceptive detail of a grand literary feat. At the same time, it retains the simplicity of a parable. "
1157,sex-and-the-city-2-movie,Rick Groen,12,"But the best, most irrefutable reason why Sex and the City 2 deserves one-half a shining star. It’s worse than Sex and the City 1, and that alone is a remarkable achievement."
1158,21-and-over-movie,Mark Olsen,0,"This is a movie that celebrates selfishness, stupidity and the mean-spirited insensitivity that goes along with it. We're better than this, America."
1159,dumb-and-dumberer-when-harry-met-lloyd-movie,Peter Travers,25,"The jokes? ""Chicks are for fags,"" says Lloyd. The film is subtitled When Harry Met Lloyd. Believe me, you don't want to be there. "
1160,addams-family-values-movie,Edward Guthmann,100,"Addams Family Values is so much better than the first film -- partly because Sonnenfeld, who made his directing debut with the first film, has refined his directing chops, but mostly because Rudnick has contributed a delightful, mock- macabre script. [19 Nov 1993, p.C1]"
1161,suburbicon-movie,Gary Thompson,38,It all feels flat-footed and pretentious.
1162,friday-night-lights-movie,Andrea Gronvall,80,Captures all the action of a tumultuous season while showing the emotional toll on the players.
1163,annabelle-movie,Graham Fuller,20,Wallis is commendably restrained and Alfre Woodard adds class as Mia’s wise ally. But Annabelle is a vortex of visual clichés beyond rescue.
1164,the-love-guru-movie,Peter Travers,12,Ninety minutes pass like an eternity. Verdict: Down for the count.
1165,scary-movie-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,75,"The whole thing wobbles, like the garish, trashy, sexy shoes the young folks are wearing this summer on their way (in droves) to movie theaters, intent on abandoning themselves to pleasurable mindlessness."
1166,the-happening-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"The Happening is a movie to walk out of, sleep through, or - best of all - not to bother with."
1167,wonderstruck-movie,A.A. Dowd ,67,"For all of the time-warp elegance, it’s hard to shake the feeling that Haynes has authored more of an exercise than a movie: a lovingly assembled flashback pastiche whose emotional core remains oddly theoretical."
1168,soldado-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"The film’s overarching story is solidly scripted, although it lags somewhat in the second act, and the government figure played by Catherine Keener is woefully undeveloped (an especially sore point since Emily Blunt in the original film portrayed such a formidable female lead)."
1169,the-indian-in-the-cupboard-movie,Staff (Not Credited),63,"This is not a great movie - sometimes, soaring orchestral music tries to evoke emotions that don't quite rise out of the drama itself - but it is a good, kind-spirited one that should please both parents and children. [14 July 1995, p.3E]"
1170,i-think-i-love-my-wife-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,Rock appears to have edited I Think I Love My Wife with a roulette wheel.
1171,serious-moonlight-movie,Betsy Sharkey,70,"It's been a long time since Ryan has had a romantic comedy that gave her room to move and though the scale is smaller here, the humor blacker and Ryan well beyond the first blush phase, you'll be glad that Serious Moonlight came along."
1172,lo-and-behold-reveries-of-the-connected-world-movie,Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,83,"If Lo and Behold is more just a collection of interviews on a series of themes than a cohesive piece of storytelling, it’s still a fascinating endeavor into how the Internet went from personal to unimaginably broad and how it could either continue to expand or perhaps even return to that infant phase again."
1173,macgruber-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"There's a reason you've never seen the words ""Will Forte"" topping the billing of a major motion picture. After the throbbing flameball of unfunny that is MacGruber, you never will again."
1174,skyline-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,11,I'd use the term science fiction to describe Skyline but the movie decidedly lacks both science and fiction. 
1175,the-hottie-the-nottie-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,0,"Custom designed for its smirking star (who is also an executive producer), this tasteless train wreck asks only that she preen and prance on cue."
1176,stoker-movie,Michael Phillips,63,"Wasikowska is a fine, intriguing actress, though I'm not sure anyone could make actual psychological sense of this woman. Nobody on screen — not Kidman, not Goode, not Wasikowska, not Jacki Weaver as Auntie Gin — seems entirely at home in the chosen (or guessed-at) style. "
1177,cool-it-movie,Nicolas Rapold,30,"The nitty-gritty science of global warming is tough enough to evaluate without the sort of hard-sell Ondi Timoner pushes on behalf of her subject, Bjørn Lomborg."
1178,american-dreamz-movie,James Berardinelli,63,This movie seems better suited as cable or video fare than for theatrical viewing.
1179,best-laid-plans-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,An inept low-budget thriller.
1180,spirit-stallion-of-the-cimarron-movie,Shawn Levy,16,"The animation is dull, the thought is fuzzy, the storytelling is vague and the music just plain stinks. It's not ""National Velvet,"" it's sure not ""The Black Stallion,"" it's not even ""Dances With Wolves."""
1181,the-emoji-movie-movie,Johnny Oleksinski,0,"Please restore my eyes to factory settings. They have seen The Emoji Movie, a new exercise in soulless branding, aimed primarily at little kids. "
1182,still-bill-movie,Nicolas Rapold,70,"Withers gets a sleepily even-keel portrait that could use more on musical technique, though it is nice to see him get happy with singer-songwriter Raul Midón."
1183,the-sugarland-express-movie,Staff (Not Credited),80,"The film moves well and never loses its gripping tension, but the lighthearted tone of the beginning takes a dive into an abyss that shocks many viewers."
1184,mulholland-dr-movie,Stephen Hunter,80,"Lynch's new movie, Mulholland Drive, is a trip and a half: It's like playing Twister and Scrabble simultaneously while high on LSD. Oh, and it's dark out."
1185,the-mummy-tomb-of-the-dragon-emperor-movie,Mike Clark,25,"Remarkably, the plot has much in common with ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army,"" yet that bundle of fun has enough vision to make even its Barry Manilow interlude seem appropriate."
1186,the-chronicles-of-narnia-the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"The Christian themes of forgiveness and sacrifice are tastefully conveyed, and the opening sequence of Nazi bombs falling on London, an event only alluded to in the book, helps dramatize Lewis's fascination with power."
1187,the-ambassador-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"Mr. Brugger's portrait of shameless, routine collusion between exploitative foreigners and dysfunctional dictatorships is depressing and undeniable.Unless, that is, The Ambassador is even more of a hoax than it seems to be. This strikes me as plausible, since somebody having this much fun in such proximity to horror may not be completely trustworthy. "
1188,the-kings-speech-movie,Manohla Dargis,70,"That film does have its attractions, notably in its two solid leads and standout support from Mr. Pearce."
1189,the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"Just when it seems about to become a real corker of an adventure movie, plunges into incomprehensible action, idiotic dialogue, inexplicable motivations, causes without effects, effects without causes, and general lunacy. What a mess."
1190,school-for-scoundrels-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,"Billy Bob Thornton's leer is much in evidence in the shoddy comedy School for Scoundrels, though the tackiness of the film, its lazy direction and its self-satisfied stupidity may mean that Mr. Thornton curled his lip about the production rather than for it."
1191,bride-wars-movie,Peter Travers,0,"The first big-studio movie released in 2009 has a damn fine chance of being the worst. Bride Wars isn't just chick-flick hell for guys, it should numb the skulls of moviegoers of all sexes and ages."
1192,clerks-ii-movie,Jack Mathews,63,"Some of the banter is fun, like Randal's debate with Elias over the relative merits of ""Star Wars"" vs. ""The Lord of the Rings."" But most is just trash-talk as shoptalk."
1193,marie-antoinette-movie,Dana Stevens,30,"Like licorice, Marie Antoinette is a confection you either love or hate, and both affects seem tied to your feeling about the director herself and her apparent identification with Louis XVI's bride. For my part, I can definitely say that I love licorice and hate Marie Antoinette. But I'm still wrestling with the enigma of Sofia Coppola."
1194,the-letters-movie,Inkoo Kang,10,It’s as punishingly dull as Sunday-school homework — and just as unnecessary.
1195,the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-movie,David Sterritt,25,"Amiably bland actors can be fun to watch, as Tom Hanks has proved. Freeman is no Hanks, though, and The Hitchhiker's Guide won't boost anyone's career into hyperspace. Or give your mind a workout."
1196,2-fast-2-furious-movie,James Berardinelli,12,"This movie only takes a few minutes to crash and burn, but more than an hour and a half to realize it. "
1197,hillarys-america-the-secret-history-of-the-democratic-party-movie,David Ehrlich,0,"As a documentary determined to damn the Democratic Party, “Hillary’s America” is a profound failure of unprecedented proportions, an embarrassment for Republicans, Americans and pretty much the rest of humankind. As a parody of right-wing conspiracy theorists, this knotted spiderweb of ideological garbage is practically “Citizen Kane.”"
1198,vantage-point-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"It's a fast-paced motion picture that fails the ""reality test"" but maintains a certain intensity for its entire running length. It's entertaining in the same way that an episode of ""24"" is entertaining."
1199,chicken-run-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,88,"A little slapstick, a little action, rich characters and a whopping serving of wit. All baked to near-perfection."
1200,charlies-angels-full-throttle-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"A less cohesive action-comedy than its predecessor, Full Throttle is instead a freewheeling collection of random action sequences strung together with little or no discernible rhyme or reason."
1201,the-sense-of-an-ending-movie,Diego Semerene,12,Ritesh Batra's film is a tale of white nostalgia that should have found its footing on dramatic grounds. 
1202,horrible-bosses-movie,Roger Ebert,88,Funny and dirty in about that order.
1203,blade-runner-movie,Rita Kempley,100,"Grand enough in scale to carry its many Biblical and mythological references, Blade Runner never feels heavy or pretentious -- only more and more engrossing with each viewing. It helps, too, that it works as pure entertainment."
1204,a-walk-to-remember-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,Takes the giant leap from your run-of-the-mill mediocrity into an alternative universe of awfulness.
1205,friday-night-lights-movie,William Arnold,75,"The film goes for a grainy, fast-cut, documentary look that is both a blessing and a curse."
1206,rize-movie,Dana Stevens,70,"Indeed, the movie sometimes has trouble living up to the richness of its subject, or keeping up with the dances' rapid spread and evolution."
1207,early-man-movie,Steve Persall,75,Early Man proudly retains Park’s simple/not simple Plasticine pleasures.
1208,i-am-number-four-movie,Bob Mondello,10,"I Am Number Four's CGI sequences are murky and dark, its performances negligible, its script genuinely inept. There is, I should note, a puppy, which arguably keeps the film this side of completely unbearable, but just barely."
1209,monsieur-lazhar-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"What makes the film enthralling is the wisdom and grace with which it addresses the twin subjects of grief and healing, and the quiet beauty of Mohamed Fellag's performance in the title role."
1210,faust-movie,Michael Atkinson,80,"Faust is not your great-granddaddy's selling-your-soul fable, but something new, a dreamy immersion into the messiness of myth, where hubris and desire can get lost in the chaos of time and retelling."
1211,hollow-man-movie,John Hartl,10,Maybe Kevin Bacon can use the Twinkie defense to explain Hollow Man.

1213,here-on-earth-movie,Jay Carr,38,Maudlin script mars teen love.
1214,aqua-teen-hunger-force-colon-movie-film-for-theaters-movie,Nathan Rabin,83,"Begins by living up to its fans' rabid expectations, and ends by justifying skeptics' doubts. In between lie roughly equivalent levels of tedium and hilarity."
1215,manchester-by-the-sea-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"To say Lonergan has evolved further with his third feature would be an understatement: He toggles between his new plot’s years with the relaxed mastery of Boyhood’s Richard Linklater. Plus, he’s finally got a complex central performance that anchors his ambitions to cinema’s all-time great brooders."
1216,three-to-tango-movie,Jay Carr,38,Trips early and never gets up off the floor.
1217,capote-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Philip Seymour Hoffman's precise, uncanny performance as Capote doesn't imitate the author so much as channel him, as a man whose peculiarities mask great intelligence and deep wounds."
1218,life-or-something-like-it-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"Oh, please. Stop and smell the manure."
1219,the-great-wall-movie,Kenneth Turan,30,"If ever a film was made with more money than sense, this is it."
1220,the-da-vinci-code-movie,Anthony Lane,0,"The Catholic Church has nothing to fear from this film. It is not just tripe. It is self-evident, spirit-lowering tripe that could not conceivably cause a single member of the flock to turn aside from the faith."
1221,searching-for-sugar-man-movie,Lawrence Toppman,88,"Rodriguez' inner peace wins us over. He seems to have enjoyed recording music, fathering kids, cleaning houses, playing sold-out gigs and simply strumming a guitar in his kitchen. Searching for Sugar Man reminds us that a wise man knows lasting riches are never the result of record sales."
1222,birth-of-the-dragon-movie,Scout Tafoya,0,A preposterous screenwriting-for-dummies exercise directed with all the flare of a mid-‘90s tourism video.
1223,air-force-one-movie,Charles Taylor,0,"If you've ever sat in a jet waiting on the runway, feeling it lumbering along in place and then bucking and shaking when it's cleared for take-off, you know what it's like to sit through Air Force One."
1224,stranded-movie,Farran Smith Nehme,25,"It’s a scrappy, unpretentious movie, with nicely calibrated pacing, but there’s no logic, little motivation and above all, no personalities."
1225,rape-me-movie,Lisa Nesselson,10,"This hard-core pic is a half-baked, punk-inflected porn odyssey masquerading as a movie worth seeing and talking about."
1226,spring-summer-fall-winter-and-spring-movie,Scott Foundas,90,"The film unfolds at a deliberate pace, with a soundtrack occupied less by dialogue than by the sounds of water flowing and crickets chirping. And if you listen carefully enough, you might just hear the sound of one hand clapping."
1227,death-wish-movie,Amy Nicholson,20,"This could be satire, but Roth and screenwriter Joe Carnahan refuse to take a stance. Ironically, a film about a guy with guts doesn’t have any itself."
1228,kicking-and-screaming-movie,Rick Groen,88,"Like the stationary figures it portrays, Kicking And Screaming is alive at the edges; it comes with a vibrant border of trenchant asides, tossed-off remarks that blend the solace of protective irony with the sterner stuff of hard truth."
1229,penelope-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,Is there anything more dull than an ineptly cynical fairy tale?
1230,pandoras-promise-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,67,"The most counterintuitive enviro-doc of the year, Pandora’s Promise makes the case that nuclear power may be the closest thing Earth has to a sustainable, realistic supply of energy. "
1231,21-grams-movie,D.W. Smith,90,"Trust me, if you have a thirst for a good, dark drama, this one is a big gulp."
1232,american-gangster-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"It lacks momentum, and thus the propulsion required to rocket it into the movie mythosphere."
1233,the-adventures-of-rocky-bullwinkle-movie,Charles Taylor,10,This clunky TV remake is stiffer than an iron curtain.
1234,god-bless-america-movie,Sara Maria Vizcarrondo,70,"You'll laugh and be offended, but if you watch it and don't want to be part of the solution, you'll know which side of the line you're on. Activism takes some unique forms."
1235,one-more-time-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,"Christopher Walken is in top form as Paul Lombard, an aging romantic crooner."
1236,johnny-english-reborn-movie,Rob Humanick,38,"As ticklish as one might find the idea of an equivalent Mr. Bean character occupying the driver's seat of a James Bond parody, it's likely that even a competent manifestation of such a scenario would pale in comparison to what Mike Myers and Jay Roach pulled off with apparent ease in their Austin Powers films."
1237,standing-in-the-shadows-of-motown-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"When all is said and done, there ain't no mountain high enough that should keep you from getting to this movie. We've heard it through the grapevine for too long."
1238,the-science-of-sleep-movie,Shawn Levy,83,This fascinating and occasionally transporting film never quite transforms into something really great.
1239,the-fate-of-the-furious-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Who am I to call it soulless, graceless, witless, incoherent — even for the franchise — and, not incidentally, brain-numbingly long at 136 minutes?"
1240,the-man-from-elysian-fields-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"This is a grown-up movie, in its humor and in its wisdom about life. You need to have lived a little to understand the complexities of Tobias Allcott, who is played by James Coburn with a pitch-perfect balance between sadness and sardonic wit."
1241,the-client-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"The movie keeps you occupied, but in a processed, unexciting way."

1250,scooby-doo-2-monsters-unleashed-movie,Robert K. Elder,25,"To call this movie a dog would also be an insult to canines, so let's just say Scooby-Doo 2 is a Scooby-Don't."
1251,crazybeautiful-movie,Mark Caro,75,"Stockwell deserves kudos for working mental illness into a teen story without making it the explicit focus, as in simplistic exercises like ""Girl, Interrupted."""
1252,the-informers-movie,Perry Seibert,25,"So, in essence, The Informers fails precisely because we never believe these lost souls were ever human enough to have had a soul to lose in the first place."
1253,zero-dark-thirty-movie,Kim Newman,100,"Gripping throughout, with an impressive central performance, this is like a Dogme 95 redo of a Chuck Norris film - by heroic effort, the good guys find and kill a bad guy. How you feel about that is something Bigelow leaves you to decide. "
1254,juwanna-mann-movie,Charles Savage,0,A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply.
1255,darkest-hour-movie,Robert Abele,65,Oldman treats Churchill’s words the way a Broadway virtuoso would: as the showstopper. And who can blame him? It works.
1256,the-reunion-movie,Roger Moore,25,"The action is wan, the laughs hard to come by."
1257,the-hangover-part-ii-movie,Ann Hornaday,25,"The Hangover Part II offers absolutely nothing new to fans of the first film. In fact, once the comfort of familiarity has worn off, they may well feel as baited-and-switched as the patrons of one of the sketchier clubs the boys visit."
1258,farewell-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"That's another thing about Carion's direction: He has an eye for unusual, atmospheric touches -- the kinds of striking little things you notice in the world and think: ""Somebody should put that in a movie."""
1259,the-brothers-grimm-movie,Robert Wilonsky,30,"It's easily the ugliest film Gilliam's ever made, a movie shot with a lens someone forgot to wipe. It's also his loudest: Every scene is amped up to 11, and every line of dialogue is delivered as though it's a cry for help from the bottom of the well."
1260,the-final-project-movie,Noel Murray,10,"Even by the shaggy standards of found footage, The Final Project is amateurish. "
1261,i-shot-andy-warhol-movie,Peter Travers,88,Immensely entertaining and provocative.
1262,the-core-movie,A.O. Scott,10,The cast of The Core deserve Oscar nominations just for being able to speak most of the lines without succumbing to the chortles. 
1263,drowning-mona-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,10,"With a sneer and a wink, Drowning Mona plunges us into a fresh deluge of idiotic Americana ."
1264,footprints-movie,John P. McCarthy,10,The barely coherent Footprints seems bent on erasing any nostalgia one might have for Hollywood's heyday.
1265,ghost-world-movie,David Edelstein,90,"Pitch-perfect -- not just the most enjoyable movie of the year but the first (after Crumb) to get the tone of a certain strain of ""underground"" comic right."
1266,it-movie,Brian Truitt,75,"The infamous clown is plenty freaky, though it’s the youngsters, bursting with hormones and one-liners, who make It one of the better Stephen King adaptations."
1267,analyze-this-movie,Mike Clark,63,"Because De Niro's performance is aptly ''Scorsese-aggressive'' while Crystal effectively underplays, one can easily sit through this bottom-line disappointment with a smile painted on, waiting for belly laughs that rarely come. [5 Mar 1999]"
1268,miss-julie-movie,Phoebe Flowers,75,Fiery but turgid adaptation of the 1890 August Strindberg play.
1269,k-pax-movie,Charles Taylor,80,"What keeps the movie going, besides Softley's intelligent direction and Mathieson's inventive cinematography, is the actors' duet between Spacey and Bridges."
1270,against-the-ropes-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,A boilerplate melodrama whose good guys and bad guys are so baldly drawn they could have been conceived by Friz Freleng.
1271,the-mortal-instruments-city-of-bones-movie,Liam Lacey,25,"Within this bloated fantasy hodgepodge, there are few grace notes: In the role of the creepy fortune teller, Madame Dorothea, CCH Pounder is evil fun. And a few special effects, including a Rottweiller who turns into a skinned hellhound, leave an impression. Otherwise, Mortal Instruments manages to occupy 130 minutes of frantic, numbing, activity."
1272,author-the-jt-leroy-story-movie,Leah Greenblatt,83,"Even when the film fails to ask so many of the questions its narrative begs, Author is still a tricky, fascinating look at the strange nexus of art, artifice, and the intoxicating cult of celebrity."
1273,metropolis-2002-movie,Liam Lacey,88,"May not have the most sophisticated narrative, but it is one of the most spectacular and masterly demonstrations of animation in screen history."

1275,stone-reader-movie,J. Hoberman,80,I've never seen a movie that paid more heartfelt tribute to the power of artistic invention. 
1276,treasure-planet-movie,Dana Stevens,20,"The delicate magic of, for instance, Hayao Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away,"" which Disney released earlier this fall, is absent from this brainless, mechanical picture."
1277,crossroads-movie,Desson Thomson,0,It does wonders to a critic to know that [Britney] could be a continuing font of teen and post-teen kitsch for years to come.
1278,amy-2015-movie,Roger Moore,75,Amy does its greatest service by holding up a mirror to this sad icon who lived her life in imitation of “The Rose.”
1279,a-fantastic-woman-movie,Phil de Semlyen,80,"A gripping, chastening study in what it’s like to spend your entire life behind enemy lines, A Fantastic Woman offers uplift, too – as well as the odd surreal touch."
1280,war-of-the-worlds-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"Rivets and amazes, even if it falls just frustratingly short of the mind-expanding grandeur it could have had."
1281,the-class-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,"The Class is clearly a microcosm of contemporary France, beset by social and economic tensions. More than that, though, it's a saga of education's struggles in many parts of the modern world. If only the film were pure fiction."
1282,king-cobra-movie,Diego Semerene,0,It’s difficult to find a reason for the film's existence beyond a spoiled platform for James Franco's ersatz boldness.
1283,gi-joe-the-rise-of-cobra-movie,Peter Travers,12,"I don't know what to say about the acting, writing and directing in G.I. Joe because I couldn't find any."
1284,the-foot-fist-way-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"The movie is so heavily weighted toward the Simmons character that no one else really gets to breathe. And though McBride's shtick is brilliant - he could get rich by playing variations on this character for the next few years, and probably will."
1285,sweet-november-movie,Roger Ebert,25,Passes off pathological behavior as romantic bliss. It's about two sick and twisted people playing mind games and calling it love.
1286,the-shawshank-redemption-movie,Rita Kempley,90,Remarkable.
1287,kramer-vs-kramer-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Kramer vs. Kramer is a movie of good performances, and it had to be, because the performances can't rest on conventional melodrama."
1288,krampus-movie,Sara Stewart,25,"Seeing as Krampus is about the Alpine demon who punishes Christmas a-holes, this is a promising start — but alas, it’s all downhill from there, making a murky and humorless hash out of a pretty great piece of "
1289,the-shape-of-water-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"A sexy, violent, preposterous, beautiful fantasy, co-writer and director Guillermo del Toro’s most vivid and fully formed achievement since “Pan’s Labyrinth” 11 years ago."
1290,deliver-us-from-evil-2014-movie,Neil Genzlinger,70,"Scott Derrickson, the director, and his special-effects crew really deliver the creepy goods here, providing an apt climax for as taut and credible a movie involving demonic possession as you’re likely to see."
1291,secret-things-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"It’s Brisseau's penchant for the flamboyantly perverse and the perversely flamboyant, however, that might have been best left secret."
1292,211-movie,David Ehrlich,16,"Unwatchable even by the subterranean standards of a direct-to-video Nicolas Cage thriller, director York Shackleton’s 211 is the kind of low-grade schlock that leaves you with a newfound respect for the basic competence that most bad movies bring to the table."
1293,the-messenger-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"The similar Kevin Bacon HBO movie ""Taking Chance"" got there first. Worse news: The earlier movie was sober, meticulous and quietly convincing, not a shouty, shoddy bore like this piece of flummery."
1294,a-midsummer-nights-dream-movie,James Berardinelli,88,A thoroughly enjoyable piece of cinema that does credit to its director and cast.
1295,stealing-harvard-movie,Michael Sragow,38,"Like Adam Sandler's ""Mr. Deeds,"" this is a hybrid, hipster-cornball movie that wants to celebrate common folk but unapologetically uses words like ""trailer trash"" to describe them."
1296,lars-and-the-real-girl-movie,David Ansen,70,"Gillespie’s movie walks a delicate line through a minefield of potential bad taste. Directed with patient, low-key sensitivity, it never goes for a cheap laugh at its protagonist’s expense."
1297,that-awkward-moment-movie,Ann Hornaday,37,"The best thing about awkward moments, after all, is that they usually pass quickly. And, blessedly, just as swiftly forgotten."
1298,hello-my-name-is-doris-movie,Peter Keough,38,"Field next tries to touch our hearts with her pitifulness. Stay away, crazy woman! At times she seems about to turn into Glenn Close in “Fatal Attraction.”"
1299,sex-and-the-city-movie,Rick Groen,0,"Bad summer films, full of furious hype and signifying nothing, are hardly exceptional these days, nor is the sound they typically make: the dull scrape of a culture hitting rock bottom. Yet this one seems uniquely bad; this one is a threshold-breaker with a different sound, the crack of rock-bottom giving way to a whole deeper layer of magma."
1300,spider-man-movie,Michael Sragow,75,"When the cast and their director are really cooking, they conjure a bipolar sense of high school-age emotion -- and use it to fuel outrageous fantasy."
1301,dumb-and-dumberer-when-harry-met-lloyd-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Even with its scant running time, this nightmarish travesty barrels along with all the whipcord speed and nimble comedic grace of a loved one’s funeral."
1302,the-next-best-thing-movie,Andy Klein,10,"Nobody involved will want to make this banal ""comedy"" a highlight of their résumé, not if they have any sense."
1303,dodgeball-a-true-underdog-story-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,Mean-spirited vulgarity and homosexual panic.
1304,a-better-life-movie,Steve Persall,100,"The weight of Carlos' world shows on his rugged face, even with rare half-smiles. This is a masterfully understated performance that should be remembered during awards season. "
1305,a-quiet-place-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,A Quiet Place is the closest thing to a silent movie since “The Artist.”
1306,wolf-creek-movie,Roger Ebert,0,"There is a line and this movie crosses it. I don't know where the line is, but it's way north of Wolf Creek. There is a role for violence in film, but what the hell is the purpose of this sadistic celebration of pain and cruelty?"
1307,dungeons-dragons-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"The audience has already checked out, long before the formulaic finish."
1308,father-figures-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,10,"Distinguished mainly by its overqualified cast and lack of inspiration, Father Figures can’t decide whether it’s a gross-out comedy or an uplifting tale of brotherly love; it embraces the worst of both worlds. "
1309,war-inc-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,"The movie has two modes - very loud and extremely loud - and all of the actors are encouraged to mug their hearts out. That even includes Cusack's real-life sister Joan, normally one of the most reliable performers in the business."
1310,the-object-of-beauty-movie,Michael Upchurch,88,"It's a spirited, sumptuously crafted tale about two spoiled Americans, Jake (John Malkovich) and Tina (Andie MacDowell), who have pushed their credit cards to the limit and now are going bankrupt in a London luxury hotel. Andie MacDowell almost equals her performance in sex, lies, and videotape. Funnier and looser than she was in Green Card, she's on her way to becoming our subtlest screen comedienne. [26 Apr 1991, p.3]"
1311,bernie-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"You should have the opportunity to experience the movie the way I did, in complete ignorance, enjoying its every weird turn."
1312,thin-ice-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,"It's an entertaining film and a deceptively gritty thriller, and Kinnear conveys Mickey's mounting desperation in winning fashion."
1313,the-karate-kid-part-iii-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"This material is wearing out its welcome. I have mastered all of the lessons The Karate Kid movies have to teach and all of the surprises they have to spring. I am also intimately familiar with the plot formula, so that nothing in this third film comes as the faintest surprise. Perhaps it is time, as Mr. Miyagi might say, to study something else."
1314,the-distinguished-gentleman-movie,Edward Guthmann,25,"The Distinguished Gentleman isn't much of a movie - it's a mess, in fact. [04 Dec 1992]"
1315,under-solen-movie,Mark Olsen,30,"Try as they might, the two central performers can never overcome the film's underdeveloped core, and are left flailing about amid Nutley's listless, glacial pacing."
1316,sexy-beast-movie,Maitland McDonagh,70,The main event is the Mamet-esque battle of foul words between vintage hard-case Ray Winstone and the seething sociopath played by Ben Kingsley.
1317,hope-springs-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,"Hope Springs is an oddly ambitious blend of bland humor and startling insight into the realities of married life. It's something like Ingmar Bergman's ""Scenes From a Marriage,"" as translated into the universe of the Lifetime Network."
1318,the-incredibles-movie,Richard Corliss,90,"The Incredibles has those characters, that heart. "
1319,greater-movie,Roger Moore,38,The faith-based football bio-drama Greater fails on so many levels one scarcely knows where to begin.
1320,star-trek-insurrection-movie,George Powell,88,The maturity of the Star Trek saga and its remarkable fan base have combined to produce a polished film that shines like a crown jewel in the Star Trek firmament. 
1321,insidious-movie,John DeFore,70,"Successful to a point (though seemingly unaware of the chuckles it produces in between shrieks), the movie has strong prospects with genre audiences but won't spawn a phenomenon resembling the filmmakers' previous franchise."
1322,waterworld-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,This movie feels like it was made by a bank rather than a person.
1323,the-mod-squad-movie,Lawrence Van Gelder,10,Torturously boring. 
1324,it-comes-at-night-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"It Comes at Night is a film of tense gradations, a chamber piece set at the twilight of humanity."
1325,gone-in-sixty-seconds-movie,Jay Carr,25,The flat tire of summer movies.
1326,only-the-strong-survive-movie,Charles Taylor,10,"All Only the Strong Survive has to offer are scraps, and it's a sad thing to sit through a movie billed as a tribute to a group of terrific performers and to come away with nothing more than scraps."
1327,bull-durham-movie,Staff (Non Credited),70,"Featuring outstanding lead performances by Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins; a witty, literate script; and an insider's familiarity with life around minor league baseball--Bull Durham is both one of the best films ever made about the national pastime and a charming romantic comedy. "
1328,timeline-movie,Jonathan Foreman,12,"It reeks of contempt for the audience. This is not just a ""B-movie"" -- it's a B-movie that fails to entertain on any level. "
1329,superheromovie-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,30,"Predictable, flat, full of name-dropping, tragically unhip, and likely to make a decent amount of cash."
1330,the-godfather-part-ii-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"Coppola is unable to draw all this together and make it work on the level of simple, absorbing narrative. The stunning text of ""The Godfather"" is replaced in Part II with prologues, epilogues, footnotes, and good intentions."
1331,recess-schools-out-movie,Christine Dolen,75,"If your kid is a fan of Disney's ""Recess,"" one of the hotter properties on ABC's Saturday morning cartoon lineup, the new inspired-by-the-TV-show movie, Recess: School's Out, will be quite a hit."
1332,the-worlds-end-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"The movie independently bungles everything it tries, like a Central Park busker who simultaneously sucks at juggling, harmonica playing and skateboarding. "
1333,die-another-day-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid, but when it has the temerity to run over two hours, you feel like winding up with a kick."
1334,the-flintstones-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,"Considering the 32 writers (including Tom S. Parker, Jim Jennewein, and Steven E. de Souza) who worked on this live-action adaptation of the 60s Hanna-Barbera cartoon series about a Stone Age family, one might have expected a few funny lines here and there, but this is mirthless (and worthless) from top to bottom."
1335,mannequin-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"This movie is a real curiosity. It's dead. I don't mean it's bad. A lot of bad movies are fairly throbbing with life. Mannequin is dead. The wake lasts 1 1/2 hours, and then we can leave the theater."
1336,galaxy-quest-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,80,The wisecracks fly fast and furious
1337,world-war-z-movie,Chris Cabin,25,"The zombies twitch, leap, gnash, and destroy, but the film has all the thrill and surprise of a model U.N. summit."
1338,x-men-apocalypse-movie,Peter Travers,63,"Director Bryan Singer, who started the whole thing in high style with 2000's ""X-Men,"" returns for a fourth time. Singer shows a lot of energy, but he and screenwriter Simon Kinberg (Fantastic Four, yuck) let the movie get way overcrowded."
1339,the-fugitive-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"""Innovative"" is not a legitimate description of The Fugitive, but ""entertaining"" is."
1340,queen-to-play-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,"Bonnaire, whose films include ""Vagabond"" and ""Monsieur Hire,"" gets Helene just right, registering her joys and disappointments with finesse."
1341,dead-ringers-movie,Rita Kempley,70,"The movie is really almost tasteful considering [Cronenberg’s] stomach-churning capacities. He always does it for a higher purpose, though, which is why his films sometimes win wider audiences. This one probably won't cross over, because it's too queasy. [23 Sept 1988]"
1342,blood-simple-movie,Lawrence Toppman,88,"(The Coens have) never again achieved the one-two punch of Blood Simple and ""Raising Arizona"" - the first darkly cynical, the second light-headedly comical."
1343,wet-hot-american-summer-movie,Stephen Hunter,0,This is supposed to be funny? It was so depressing I almost started to cry.
1344,the-flat-movie,Chuck Wilson,90,"In families, this fascinating film suggests, acknowledging or denying the darker truths of one's legacy is a choice that must be made again and again, each and every day."
1345,the-human-centipede-first-sequence-movie,David Edelstein,0,The movie stinks to heaven.
1346,focus-movie,Connie Ogle,63,This film and Miller's vision remind us of the danger of giving in to fear.
1347,midnight-special-movie,Soren Andersen,88,"The picture is a long tease, artfully constructed. Mood is all-important, and it’s a mood designed to keep the audience off balance and on edge until the very end."
1348,cool-world-movie,Brian Lowry,10,"Style has seldom pummeled substance as severely as in Cool World, a combination funhouse ride/acid trip that will prove an ordeal for most visitors in the form of trial by animation."
1349,tyler-perrys-a-madea-christmas-movie,Frank Scheck,20,"The clunky narrative doesn’t ring true for a second, and the hackneyed dialogue is even worse."
1350,bleed-for-this-movie,Richard Roeper,100,"Miles Teller gives the performance of his career as the indefatigable Vinny “The Pazmanian Devil” Pazienza, and writer-director Ben Younger delivers one of the best boxing movies of the decade in Bleed for This."
1351,maniac-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"This poor man’s Norman Bates, though, doesn’t make us wonder what makes him tick; he makes us want to shut our eyes."
1352,snow-dogs-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,10,"Snow Dogs may simply be a stupid waste of your time. But if you know the source, it's an abomination."
1353,a-glimpse-inside-the-mind-of-charles-swan-iii-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,20,"Seriously, this is one of the strangest and most painful films in recent memory."
1354,girl-most-likely-movie,Sara Stewart,25,"I only laughed once, and it was when Whit Stillman made a cameo to be snubbed by the newly self-actualized Imogene. But it was mostly in disbelief; pretentious or not, Stillman represents a caliber of smart writing that’s wholly absent from Girl Most Likely. "
1355,legend-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"To take such a subject and render it without focus, interest, or joy—to make a long, dull movie from it — qualified as some perverse sort of achievement."
1356,kicking-and-screaming-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,90,"There's plenty of wit on the surface, but the pain of paralysis comes through loud and clear."
1357,happy-gilmore-movie,Owen Gleiberman,33,Adam Sandler stars in a one-joke Caddyshack for the blitzed and jaded.
1358,i-hate-valentines-day-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Stick a fork in Nia Vardalos. I've been to funerals that were a lot more fun than I Hate Valentine's Day, her second alleged romantic comedy in less than a month."
1359,ted-2-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"In a movie devoted mainly to making you laugh, it’s a plea for tolerance that takes your breath away."
1360,gone-girl-movie,Robbie Collin,80,"For all its simmering malice and buried secrets, it’s worth remembering that this is David Fincher in fun mode: unnerving, shocking and provoking for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, but mostly sickness."
1361,thunderbirds-movie,Alan Niester,0,"Simply put, this is a bad, bad film, this summer's answer to last summer's ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman."" A dog for the dog days of summer."
1362,jonah-hex-movie,Keith Phipps,0,"Every once in a while, a film limps into theaters so stitched together, it's a wonder it doesn't rip apart in the projector. Jonah Hex is such a film."
1363,tokarev-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Rage lets us see where all the money was spent — on Cage, and on a noisy, metal-rending car chase through scenic Mobile. It’s head-slappingly dumb, it’s dull and even the novelty of filming outside of the over-filmed Los Angeles adds nothing."
1364,three-days-of-rain-movie,Darren Reidy,30,The real subversion is director Michael Meredith's insistence on not capturing interactions between human beings in a frame; with some forethought he could have filmed the actors individually and spliced.
1365,even-cowgirls-get-the-blues-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"Cowgirls, a flaky-surreal adaptation of Tom Robbins' 1976 feminist hipster road novel, finds the director of ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and ""My Own Private Idaho"" lost in the ozone of his own private whimsies."
1366,entourage-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,Charm has curdled into smarm in the big-screen version of Entourage. The jaunty style of a hit TV series has been replaced by huge spasms of false energy and a sense of barely concealed flop sweat.
1367,wonder-woman-movie,Alex Abad-Santos,70,The violence and fights in Wonder Woman are intriguing not just because they’re stunning but also because of how emotional they are.
1368,sleepover-movie,Angel Cohn,30,"The only memorable moments in the entire film come courtesy of three supporting characters, dopey skateboarders (Evan Peters, Shane Hunter, Hunter Parrish) who blindly follow Julie around."
1369,the-informers-movie,J.R. Jones,0,Repulsive 80s flashback.
1370,anything-but-love-movie,Bob Westal,30,Director and (uncredited) choreographer Robert Cary and his performers are simply not up to the task of recalling the great moments they are trying so hard to evoke. 
1371,lazer-team-movie,Clayton Dillard,12,"The premise thoughtlessly combines elements from Marvel comics, Men and Black, and a swath of '80s pop culture to curiously neutered effect."
1372,three-to-tango-movie,Bruce Fretts,0,I didn't think Matthew Perry could find a romantic comedy more inert or inane than the 1997 fiasco ''Fools Rush In.''
1373,dogtooth-movie,Jennie Punter,88,Lanthumos's accomplished and fascinating Dogtooth pushes the notion of parents screwing up their kids into seriously disturbing and darkly comic terrain. 
1374,camp-x-ray-movie,Steve Macfarlane,38,"Peter Sattler's film feels quintessentially Sundance: an expensively mounted treatise on important issues that's terrified to dig in obsessively, yet so ramrod-stiff with indignation that it never comes anywhere near compelling entertainment."
1375,inside-job-movie,J.R. Jones,80,"""American Casino"" and Michael Moore's ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" offered more striking images of the human wreckage, but Ferguson is more successful at nailing the perpetrators in New York and their gullible accomplices in Washington. "
1376,beverly-hills-cop-iii-movie,Evette Porter,10,"The formula has stayed the same, but Murphy isn't the Foley of 10 years ago.  The only thing that remains is his patented Chic-let grin. [7 Jun 1994]"
1377,no-mans-land-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"In the remarkable, ferociously intelligent new film No Man's Land, Bosnian writer-director Danis Tanovic gives us a movie portrait of the Bosnian War, a conflict that has devastated his country, friends and neighbors -- and found in it both shocking humor and searing, relentless tragedy."
1378,the-ridiculous-6-movie,Deborah Day,0,The Ridiculous 6 is everything wrong with Hollywood for the past two decades: a circle-jerk of imbecilic white-dude humor.
1379,best-night-ever-movie,Joe Leydon,20,"The four leads are nothing if not game, and actually earn  respect, along with a fair amount of sympathy, for their uninhibited willingness to go to extremes. But there are limits to what they can do to dispel the overall sense of mounting desperation as the gross-out tomfoolery grows ever more tedious."
1380,dumb-and-dumberer-when-harry-met-lloyd-movie,Sean Axmaker,25,It's so sloppy that the flashback montage includes clips from scenes that were cut from the film! 
1381,stray-dog-movie,Peter Keough,88,"Immersive, enlightening documentary."
1382,closer-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,Few directors are more adept at playing with all this anguish and exhilaration than Mike Nichols.
1383,house-on-haunted-hill-movie,Marc Savlov,30,It's all a bit of overkill.
1384,thoroughbreds-movie,E. Oliver Whitney,90,"Ultimately it’s Finley’s sleek and stylish visual language that makes Thoroughbred a must-see, and one of the best surprises out of Sundance. He composes his shots with such precision, control, and confidence."
1385,rosewater-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"Rosewater is an earnest picture, but it's also got some juice — there's vitality and feeling in it, the secret ingredients so often missing from even the most well-intentioned first features."
1386,charlies-angels-movie,Jonathan Foreman,75,"The film's tongue is so firmly in cheek that, without being a spoof like ""Dragnet"" or ""The Brady Bunch Movie,"" it has more in common with the ""Austin Powers"" films."
1387,the-man-without-a-face-movie,Staff (Not Credited),83,"Gibson has done a capable job of directing The Man Without a Face, showing little in the way of a personal style, but taking advantage of the skills brought to the project by his collaborators. [27 Aug 1993]"
1388,let-me-in-movie,Scott Bowles,88,"Let Me In is going to lure and please fans of the original; like the first, the remake is graphically violent but as tense as good horror gets."
1389,don-jon-movie,Odie Henderson,38,"A sex comedy that just lays there and expects you to do all the work. Gordon-Levitt's direction is repetitive and dry, and his screenplay is a collage of badly cut out pieces from other movies."
1390,down-and-out-in-beverly-hills-movie,Jay Scott,88,"Once you overlook the laborious contrivance of Jerry's background, Down and Out in Beverly Hills is a sharp, sweet comedy of affluent manners. [31 Jan 1986]"
1391,the-people-garden-movie,Justin Lowe,20,"Crucially, Litz misses almost every opportunity to build atmosphere and create suspense, or even a hint of heightened drama, rendering the tone of the film virtually somnambulistic throughout."
1392,captain-phillips-movie,Marc Mohan,91,"The pressure cooker atmosphere builds for almost too long, but when the resolution finally occurs, the sense of relief is that much more palpable."
1393,detroit-rock-city-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,"It's an utterly fake nostalgia piece -- stupid and pandering, a bad-boy teen flick that plays less like a loving look at the late '70s than a terrible movie from the late '70s."
1394,sex-lies-and-videotape-movie,Rita Kempley,90,"What ""The Big Chill"" was to baby boomers, the inspirational sex, lies, and videotape is to the mall crowd. It's designer soul-searching, a looking glass for a generation. "
1395,someone-like-you-movie,Rita Kempley,10,A gooey romantic comedy that sticks to everything except its principles.
1396,angel-a-movie,Nathan Rabin,25,"At heart, it's just the latest from one-man industry Luc Besson, so even though it looks like art, it plays like schlock."
1397,unfriended-game-night-movie,Simon Abrams,25,"The biggest difference between the two films is that ""Unfriended"" is dynamic and cruel while Unfriended: Dark Web is unbelievably stupid and sadistic. Neither movie is especially smart or incisive about the Way We Live Now, but they don't really have to be. "
1398,florence-foster-jenkins-movie,Ann Hornaday,75,Florence Foster Jenkins brims with love for its characters and forbearance for even their most blinkered self-deception. 
1399,stories-we-tell-movie,Calvin Wilson,100,"This is the kind of film that benefits from being experienced with as little prior knowledge as possible. As one watches it, certain questions may arise. But don’t worry — the answers are fascinating."
1400,the-bourne-legacy-movie,Shawn Levy,83,The result is a newly revived spy movie franchise -- and the best big-budget action film of the summer.
1401,the-rewrite-movie,Nick Schager,30,"Amid much talk about character, story structure, and theme, Grant delivers his usual rakish-charmer routine in a role that’s as hackneyed as the script’s portrait of women, the movie industry, and Star Wars fanatics is one-note."
1402,clash-of-the-titans-1981-movie,Ed Gonzalez,75,"These fantastical He-Man epics were common in the early ’80s (Legend, Conan the Barbarian, and The Beastmaster were all variations of the same theme), and while Clash of the Titans remains one of the genre’s homelier entries, there’s no faulting a film this lovingly and aptly arcane."
1403,what-happens-in-vegas-movie,Richard Schickel,10,"Worst-in-breed not only for this year, but very likely in living memory."
1404,confessions-of-a-shopaholic-movie,Michael Sragow,38,The problem with Confessions of a Shopaholic isn't conspicuous consumption. It's ostentatious idiocy.
1405,little-fockers-movie,Sean O\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Connell,25,"How bad is the third installment... So bad that this bland, pointless sequel features a gratuitous scene where the stunning Jessica Alba - one of many new faces added to an already overstuffed ensemble - strips down to her lacy undergarments, belly-flops into a backyard pit, rolls around in the mud, and I still can't recommend you pay to see it. "
1406,vegas-vacation-movie,David Sterritt,0,"The Griswalds drive to Las Vegas ""because half the fun is getting there,"" but the fun never begins in this disappointing sequel to the Vacation slapstick comedies."
1407,enigma-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,"The film manages to crack all its codes, and even when it sags a bit, it's never lacking grace and some wit. Not enigmatically at all, it pleases and teases us -- in high style."
1408,cold-comfort-farm-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"There's nothing deep or meaningful to be unearthed in this feel-good comedy, but it nevertheless makes for solid entertainment."
1409,jerry-maguire-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,Brashly engaging.
1410,hairspray-movie,Lawrence Toppman,88,"The film's an irresistible time capsule of that Camelot summer, blending girrrrrl power, social consciousness and faux-'60s pop with the fizz of a soda jerk whipping up a root beer float."
1411,the-snowtown-murders-movie,Noel Murray,67,The sense of enervation that creeps into the movie's second half is bothersome mainly because The Snowtown Murders is often brilliant in its depiction of the mundanity of evil.
1412,license-to-drive-movie,Jay Scott,12,"License to Drive, directed by Greg Beeman and written by Montreal's Neil Tolkin, is not only stupid, a virtual requirement of summer teen exploitation movies, it's also nasty: it's been designed to turn its swooning target audience into a pajama party of neurotics. [08 July 1988]"
1413,chunhyangdyun-movie,Jared Rapfogel,90,"A multi-layered, experimental film, a film about storytelling, but the beauty of it is that it transcends the story at its center while still celebrating the virtues of a tale well-told."
1414,hobo-with-a-shotgun-movie,V.A. Musetto,25,"Japan's Takashi Miike has the formula down pat, but Eisener has no idea how to give violence a touch of class."
1415,match-point-movie,Todd McCarthy,80,Well-observed and superbly cast picture is the filmmaker's best in quite a long time.
1416,joy-movie,Steven Rea,75,"Joy's entry into the world of entrepreneurship has the crazy trajectory of a rocket gone haywire, and Russell's movie is kind of haywire, too. "
1417,the-devil-inside-movie,Peter Travers,0,The Devil Inside manages not only to scrape the barrel's bottom but to drill a hole in said bottom and funnel deeper into the scum.
1418,the-13th-movie,Jordan Hoffman,80,"A few small hiccups aside, 13th is very much not a Michael Moore film. It is organised, detailed and powerful."
1419,network-movie,A.D. Murphy,100,Sidney Lumet’s direction is outstanding.
1420,safe-haven-movie,Melissa Anderson,30,Hough emits all the charisma of a personal assistant.
1421,beirut-movie,Steve Persall,75,"Hamm makes for a compelling guide, Bogart-weary and mind racing, assessing each situation with a readable face for the camera. Beirut won’t make him a bigger movie star, but more interesting actors are tough to find."
1422,9-dead-gay-guys-movie,V.A. Musetto,0,Offensive and unwatchable.
1423,girl-6-movie,Peter Travers,12,"Girl 6 is shameless stuff -- pompous, sentimental and attitudinizing. To swat the Spikeman with his own symbol, the film feels like he phoned it in."
1424,your-highness-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"An exhaustingly pushy, phallocentric and witlessly smutty spoof of early '80s medieval fantasies such as ""Krull"" and ""The Beastmaster."" "
1425,102-dalmatians-movie,Larry Terenzi,35,A film without mirth or magic.
1426,jack-the-giant-slayer-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,"Too scary for very young children, yet too silly for most older fans of director Bryan Singer’s earlier forays into the Superman and X-Men franchises, “Jack” seems designed to appeal to a very narrow, and possibly illusory, demographic: the mature moppet."
1427,40-days-and-40-nights-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,So eyeball-gougingly awful that you're tempted to give up movies for Lent.
1428,schindlers-list-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,"The movie's ending at the train station and the modern-day epilogue feel protracted and indulgent...Apart from the ending though, this is Spielberg's most articulate movie ever."
1429,boo!-a-madea-halloween-movie,Odie Henderson,38,"At 103 minutes, this film has way too much dead weight. Scenes are repeated over and over, and some of the acting would not cut it in a school play. But in the rare moments when Tyler Perry’s Boo! A Madea Halloween is firing on all cylinders, it displays a cleverness which hints that, with more time and a few more iterations of the script, this might have been a good movie. "
1430,a-million-ways-to-die-in-the-west-movie,Kate Erbland,22,"A relentlessly unfunny, charmless send-up of better films with better ideas."
1431,shrek-forever-after-movie,Betsy Sharkey,70,"Whatever else gets tossed into the mix, Shrek must be the heart and soul. In this, Myers is a master; he makes it seem easy being green."
1432,blood-work-movie,J. Hoberman,80,"A bracingly no-nonsense, highly professional policier—as proudly old-fashioned as its curmudgeon hero."
1433,the-void-movie,Jared Mobarak,83,"Its style is audacious, its plot minimalist, and its future full of potential."
1434,the-godfather-part-ii-movie,Daniel Green,100,"Combining the director’s key interests in dysfunctional family units, social stratification and the seething undercurrent of violence inherent in all positions of power, Coppola’s mafia sequel not only succeeded in dwarfing its still terrific predecessor in terms of drama and scope, but also brought together De Niro and Pacino on screen for the first (but thankfully not the last) time."
1435,the-postman-movie,Peter Stack,25,The dragging pace is one of several agonizing defects in this bloated sci-fi action drama. 
1436,gone-girl-movie,Xan Brooks,80,"Gone Girl, finally, may be no more than a storm in a teacup. But what an elegant, bone-china teacup this is. And what a fearsome force-10 gale we have brewing inside."
1437,geostorm-movie,John Fink,25,"Unfortunately, the gleefully absurd ingenuity of Geostorm stops at its title."
1438,titus-movie,Ernest Hardy,30,"An often gorgeous, dizzying assault of ideas and visual flourishes...it's just not very good."
1439,night-at-the-museum-battle-of-the-smithsonian-movie,Rick Kisonak,20,"Even by Hollywood sequel standards, this is lazily conceived, cynically recycled stuff."
1440,life-is-beautiful-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"A deeply moving blend of cold terror and rapturous hilarity. Lovingly crafted by Italy's top comedian and most popular filmmaker, it's that rare comedy that takes on a daring and ambitious subject and proves worthy of it."
1441,goodbye-to-language-3d-movie,Mark Olsen,90,"Always looking forward, Godard remains remarkably capable of seeing the world and thinking about filmmaking with clear eyes and fresh ideas."
1442,mchales-navy-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"It's even less funny than it sounds. By the end, this soporific comedy makes 105 minutes feel more like a two-year hitch."
1443,urban-legends-final-cut-movie,Sean Axmaker,0,"No style, no irony and no smarts, just a vicious streak that lasts 90 minutes."
1444,no-one-lives-movie,Farran Smith Nehme,0,"So unspeakably dull that it can’t even offend, save when the filmmakers have the almighty nerve to quote Alfred Hitchcock and Jonathan Demme. It would be far better to rip off a William Castle movie, and aim for a level they have a prayer of actually hitting."
1445,american-hustle-movie,Steve Persall,100,"Russell and co-writer Eric Warren Singer lay out these deceits and double-crosses with precision but American Hustle isn't merely a procedural. Defining these outsized personalities, tracing their unconventional connections and affections, is where Russell's movie finds its irreverent heartbeat."
1446,the-blind-swordsman-zatoichi-movie,Dana Stevens,80,"Like many musicals, The Blind Swordsman works better in individual scenes than as a whole. Mr. Kitano is not the most disciplined storyteller, and the plot meanders along tangents and stumbles into flashbacks, losing momentum for long stretches in the middle."
1447,dirty-harry-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"I can see why this movie scared so many people. I’m fairly liberal and I find Clint’s super-cop infinitely appealing. Imagine how this movie goes down with people who already have one foot in the door of the local militia or Klan auxiliary. Even Pauline Kæl would have to admit that politics aside, this is a pretty damn effective action movie. This is Clint at maybe his best looking and healthiest, and his Inspector Callahan is perhaps every rebel’s dream."
1448,tomcats-movie,Robert Horton,0,"Re-adjust the levels of cinematic hell, because ""Porky's"" just got bumped up a notch."
1449,paprika-movie,Gianni Truzzi,91,"Despite the jumble, Kon's eye-popping, surreal mastery of the Japanese dream is awakening."
1450,new-years-eve-movie,Stephen Holden,30,"A depressing two-hour infomercial pitching Times Square as the only place in the universe you want to be when the ball drops at midnight on Dec. 31. (Believe me, it's not.) "
1451,erased-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,33,"Erased is a snoozy, sputtering Euro chase flick—a sort of poor man’s Liam Neeson revenge movie."
1452,skyline-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"Their (The Brothers Strause) effects are pretty good, on a fairly limited budget. And that's about all you can say for Skyline."
1453,a-time-to-kill-movie,Hal Hinson,20,"In his screen version, Schumacher does a flamboyant job of staging the book without showing the slightest interest in what it's about. Granted, Grisham's original is no masterpiece; it's beach reading, but it deserves credit for addressing its subject with some conviction and integrity."
1454,head-over-heels-movie,Jack Mathews,0,"Thekind of misfire that makes you understand why every waiter, parking valet and sushi delivery boy in Beverly Hills has a screenplay under his waistband."
1455,insidious-chapter-3-movie,Katie Rife,67,"The motif of grief runs throughout Insidious: Chapter 3, which is surprisingly thematically rich for the third installment of a horror franchise. This emotional undercurrent informs the fright scenes, which otherwise lean rather heavily on jump scares."
1456,two-step-movie,Robert Abele,90,"Giving flair to the inevitable and imbuing those stakes with emotional heft are key to this type of patiently nasty, slow-boil noir. That Johnson understands this makes his feature debut a particularly confident and enjoyable one."
1457,love-and-honor-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Love and Honor may be politically clueless, but Hemsworth and the student journalist he hooks up with (fellow Aussie Teresa Palmer of “Warm Bodies’’) do make an undeniably attractive couple."
1458,the-cook-the-thief-his-wife-her-lover-movie,Jay Scott,25,"In Drowning by Numbers, there is a strange character called Smut, aprecocious boy genius fascinated by sex and obsessed with death: hisavocation is the compulsive cataloguing of dead animals. The Cook, TheThief, His Wife & Her Lover feels as if it could been made by that child. [31 March 1990]"

1461,hannibal-movie,Charles Taylor,0,"Hannibal, which is very likely the worst film of this year and quite possibly the next, achieves what no movie I can recall ever even attempting: It somehow manages to be both repugnant and boring."

1463,the-legend-of-bagger-vance-movie,Dana Stevens,10,Not only is it excruciatingly boring -- but its central premises are so banal and dubious as to border on offensiveness.
1464,leviathan-2014-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Why should you suffer through a 140-minute Russian film that is basically a contemporary remake of The Book of Job? Because it's a stupendous piece of work, that's why, and because it represents the kind of challenging, intimate filmmaking that transcends language and borders."
1465,jeepers-creepers-ii-movie,Claudia Puig,12,"The thrills, chills, frights, starts and occasional screams that a good horror film elicits from an audience are not there. Jeepers, the Creeper has little to recommend it. "
1466,good-morning-vietnam-movie,Bill Cosford,75,"All the film's energy, and most of its appeal, lie in the scenes in which Williams is talking to his audience, the most singular captive audience in Top 40 history.

1470,airheads-movie,Geoff Pevere,0,Airheads is a movie so direly muddled it actually manages - no mean feat this - to seem more stupid than the rock biz idiocy it aims to satirize. [5 Aug 1994]
1471,crossroads-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,"Functions mainly as a big-screen showcase for America's No. 1 teen tease, with the story and other characters serving mainly as accessories."
1472,first-they-killed-my-father-movie,Allan Hunter,70,"We only see what Loung sees, feel what she experiences but through her ordeal there develops an emotional connection to a country undergoing some of its darkest hours."

1475,stronger-movie,Sara Stewart,75,Director David Gordon Green (“Our Brand Is Crisis”) generally skips feel-good cliché to chronicle Bauman’s struggle with being painted as the face of never letting the terrorists win.
1476,blindspotting-movie,Jesse Hassenger,83,"Diggs, Casal, and Estrada are all walking on a high wire here, requiring a balance so delicate that it may not be visible to some of the audience until they have to decide for themselves whether Blindspotting’s leap-of-faith climax works."
1477,the-art-of-getting-by-movie,Rex Reed,75,"Has more charm and wit than most of its J.D. Salinger-inspired cousins in the same genre, and is undeniably engaging."

1479,diamond-tongues-movie,Sarah Kurchak,83,"Although it stumbles a bit at the end with a self-aware redemption that isn’t entirely earned or particularly in character, Diamond Tongues is still a brilliant and realistic portrait of the young artist as a bitter borderline failure."
1480,silence-movie,Steve Persall,100,Only Scorsese could craft a film of such moral gravity for multiplexes and fascinate for nearly three hours.
1481,blue-crush-movie,Hazel-Dawn Dumpert,70,"For the most part, the action, shot entirely on Hawaii's famed North Shore without blue screens or tanks, is awesome, all swirling turquoise tubes, thundering foam hammers and sleek, graceful riders."

1483,death-of-a-nation-movie,David Ehrlich,0,"The meandering and insufferable Death of a Nation is little more than a greatest-hits collection of its creator’s favorite neocon conspiracy theories, which frame the Democratic Party for the fascistic tendencies embodied by Donald Trump."
1484,tadpole-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"Stanford and Neuwirth are performers of such nuance that a mere glimpse of his body language and her bawdy language speak volumes about the difference between love and sex, the ideal and the real."
1485,gothika-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"French director Mathieu Kassovitz Frenches this flimsy tale to death. No scene goes underplayed, no performance (save one, from Robert Downey Jr.) lacks volume, no horror cliche is forgotten."
1486,dark-water-movie,Marc Savlov,20,"The overall emotion the film generates is one of moist, enervated ennui. Who cares if the apartment is haunted when the best the ghost can do is get things a bit damp and run laps on the floor above?"
1487,finding-neverland-movie,David Ansen,80,"Mingling reality and fantasy, Forster has given us a luminous, touching meditation on life and art. "
1488,for-a-good-time-call-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"There are several cameos in For a Good Time, Call… by famous actors portraying the girls' phone-sex clients, including Kevin Smith and Seth Rogen, but they've been clearly been left to improvise, and they don't put much effort into their routines."
1489,her-movie,Richard Roeper,88,"Her works as a real romance, and as a commentary on the ways technology connects everyone to the world but also isolates us from legitimate, warm human contact."
1490,the-matrix-revolutions-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"The Wachowski brothers have rendered their chronicles into banality, as if trying to imitate the qualitative tailspin of the ""Star Wars"" series. "

1496,go-for-sisters-movie,Noel Murray,70,"John Sayles’ Go For Sisters is his best film in more than a decade, and feels like one he could’ve made in the 1980s. It’s a small picture, simply presented, and exists outside of current trends—which isn’t always to its benefit."
1497,welcome-to-mooseport-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"Welcome to Mooseport... is intended to be a comedy; that hypothesis is a generous leap of faith, given the fact that ""House of Sand and Fog"" contains more moments of mirth than this rather joyless exercise in waste and torpor. "

1499,the-internship-movie,Steve Persall,75,"The humor is an underdog's fantasy, tapping the same vein Murray bled dry with self-important camp counselors and military officers; the less cool they are, the harder they'll fall."

1506,the-eyes-of-tammy-faye-movie,Kim Morgan,91,"A hilarious, sad and sometimes-inspiring documentary directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, the film is an all-out Tammy valentine -- campy, dramatic and, of course, makeup-smeared. And better than any melodrama you'll see this year."
1507,the-exorcist-re-release-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"This jolting tale of a 12-year-old girl possessed by the devil, her desperate movie actress mother and the two priests called in to exorcise the demon, actually seems a deeper movie now -- more intense, less formulaic or shallow. Yet it's also retained all its original hypnotic narrative grip. [2000 re-release]"
1508,resident-evil-apocalypse-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,"It's just too bad that almost nothing in the movie seems original. The ""Thriller"" video may have featured hokey dancing zombies, but at least someone was making an effort."
1509,pulp-fiction-movie,Rick Groen,100,"Pulp Fiction is at least three movies rolled into one, and they're all scintillating."
1510,bewitched-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"Bewitched piles miscalculation upon miscalculation, beginning by casting the iron-willed Kidman, one of film's gutsiest and most fearless actresses, as a regressive pre-feminist dumb-blonde doormat, a sort of mildly retarded amalgam of Marilyn Monroe, Renée Zellweger, and Meg Ryan."
1511,kangaroo-jack-movie,Dana Stevens,10,"What better to do with such a quiet, majestic landscape than to liven it up with the noise and vulgarity of lowest-common-denominator American pop culture?"

1516,my-all-american-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,"Every key plot turn is telegraphed at least twice, just in case you missed it the first time. Every emotional moment in the movie is foreshadowed a few beats in advance by the manipulative musical score."
1517,kitchen-stories-movie,David Rooney,70,"The film appears consistently poised to go deeper but instead hangs back, making it less substantial than it might have been. Yet the sweet-natured story's gentle humor and poignancy should draw appreciative audiences."
1518,still-alice-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,"Elements of its plot have the standard quality of a Hallmark production, and the work of some of the film's costars is a bit too on the nose. But, with Moore and Stewart on the case, we feel the presence of something real here, something that can't be shrugged off or ignored."

1520,jolene-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,30,"Jolene's skin may smell like warm milk to Brad, but to the rest of us it has curdled long before she leaves his bed. "
1521,born-to-be-blue-movie,Noel Murray,70,"By reducing Baker's story to just a couple of pivotal years, Budreau makes every moment matter, including a tense final scene that treats the preparation for a performance like a duel at high noon. Like Baker himself, Born to Be Blue finds drama in minimalism."
1522,the-human-centipede-ii-full-sequence-movie,Wesley Morris,0,"Really, all Six is going for, with the generous application of both hardware supplies to the skin and feces to the camera, is a tired commentary on his shallow talents: They're excremental."

1524,furious-7-movie,Marc Savlov,67,"Furious 7 is, to put it succinctly, a rush and a half."
1525,southside-with-you-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,Southside With You proves once and for all that a romantic film doesn’t rely on suspense. We know these people are getting together. What holds us to our seats is wondering how it will happen.
1526,albert-nobbs-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,"García, previously the director of ""Mother and Child,"" ""Passengers"" and numerous TV episodes (and the son of Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez), never feels entirely comfortable with the period or location, but for all its limitations Albert Nobbs has a puzzling undertow, and gets more involving the longer you stick with it."

1535,another-year-movie,Kyle Smith,100,"Getting a small cohort of humanity dead right is an impressive artistic achievement, but Mike Leigh's beautifully modulated English drama Another Year advances even farther."
1536,closer-movie,Wesley Morris,88,"From Marber's fiercely polished writing, Nichols wrings every drop of acid, yet it's a show of the director's goodness that a movie fundamentally preoccupied with interpersonal ugliness is allowed to end on a convincing note of beauty."

1538,the-grifters-movie,Desson Thomson,90,"If Frears and screenwriter Donald E. Westlake (who scripted ""The Stepfather"") are light on substance, they're satisfyingly heavy on nuance. Grifters may not blow you away afterward but it keeps your attention riveted during."
1539,fierce-creatures-movie,Leonard Klady,90,A hilarious farce.
1540,im-still-here-movie,Cliff Doerksen,0,"To judge from this agonizing documentary, sniveling man-child Joaquin Phoenix was put on earth to make us appreciate Crispin Glover for the level-headed fellow he is."

1543,310-to-yuma-movie,Ty Burr,88,"Both actors are among the best, most intuitively creative we have, and whatever transpires offscreen in Crowe’s case, onscreen they only serve their characters. Neither man showboats here, and it’s a thrill to watch them work."
1544,joy-movie,Sheila O'Malley,75,"Joy doesn’t work entirely, and the structure set up so clearly in the opening sequence is dropped early on for no apparent reason, but I’ll be damned if I didn’t get carried away at the story of a mop sweeping the nation. It’s a lunatic “Mildred Pierce,"" without the murder. "
1545,fifty-shades-freed-movie,Roger Moore,38,"At least this time, some of the laughs are intentional."
1546,the-huntsman-winters-war-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,A resoundingly unlovable movie that almost resists being watched.
1547,flags-of-our-fathers-movie,William Arnold,91,"The movie offers one authentically terrific performance: Beach as Hayes. He's so painfully sympathetic in the role that he absolutely breaks your heart, and he looks like the front-runner in the best-supporting actor Oscar race."
1548,oss-117---lost-in-rio-movie,Michelle Orange,70,"The look of the reference-heavy film, mostly shot on location in Brazil, is impeccably cheesy, but the Nazi humor and awkward sexist and racist eruptions smell a little stale. And yet, given time, the film develops an energy all its own."
1549,the-hundred-foot-journey-movie,Bill Zwecker,75,"Overall this is a solid, intelligent movie about the joys of expanding our horizons — in all directions."
1550,margot-at-the-wedding-movie,Michael Sragow,0,Margot at the Wedding is a Christmas gift for high-class depressives: a compendium of malaise fit for an L.L. Bean catalog.

1552,the-big-bounce-movie,Desson Thomson,20,An insipid potboiler set against the far more enticing surf and sand of Oahu's North Shore. 
1553,irreversible-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"The moral of Irreversible -- time destroys everything -- isn't nearly as profound as writer-director Gaspar Noé seems to think it is, which is why some critics have already dismissed the movie as the facile, misogynistic posturings of a provocateur."
1554,the-perfect-holiday-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,38,"If you're really hoping for a perfect holiday, steer clear of this stale fruitcake of a comedy."
1555,all-the-right-moves-movie,Staff (Not Credited),38,"This cliche-riddled picture was the directorial debut of veteran cinematographer Michael Chapman, who took no risks in his first time out."
1556,holy-rollers-movie,Joe Williams,63,"As a testament to traditions that are usually kept hidden from Hollywood, Holy Rollers is a mitzvah. But as a thriller, it's bubkes."

1561,inception-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,80,"Inception, though, is no ""Avatar""--instead, it’s the movie that many wanted ""Avatar"" to be. In a roaringly fast first hour, we’re introduced to a new technology that allows for the bodily invasion of another person’s dreamworld."
1562,hugo-cabret-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,100,"All the actors are wonderful, including Sacha Baron Cohen as a villainous Inspector."
1563,tusk-movie,Roger Moore,38,"In this not-even-faintly scary, rarely funny horror comedy, Smith is still sucking down big gulps of empty calories and hoping we’ll laugh at his belch."
1564,hard-candy-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Hard Candy is impressive and effective. As for what else it may be, each audience member will have to decide."
1565,everything-is-illuminated-movie,Richard Schickel,70,"This often vivid movie, though it doesn't quite attain its highest intentions, is well worth seeing. And thinking about."
1566,dopamine-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"What's alluring is the way the characters played by John Livingston and Sabrina Lloyd savor each other, in between their troubles. Movies are too quick to interrupt romance with sex. Sarah and Rand fascinate us with their dance of dread and desire."
1567,suburbicon-movie,Katie Walsh,25,"Ultimately Suburbicon is woefully underwritten. Gardner and Maggie are mere sketches, a set of facial tics and accessories masquerading as real characters."
1568,dreamcatcher-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"Isn't worth the time, money, or effort. For Stephen King aficionados, it's just the latest cinematic nightmare. "
1569,dr-t-and-the-women-movie,David Sterritt,75,"Some will dislike its shaggy-dog screenplay and restless camera work, and others may find its finale too postfeminist for comfort."
1570,cabin-boy-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,It is possible to watch 90 minutes of this comedy without once cracking a smile. [12 Jan 1994]
1571,free-willy-movie,Michael Wilmington,90,"There's a muscular sincerity to this movie, a power and spread to its imagery that triumphs over the occasional candied purple patches or strained plot twists. [16 Jul 1993 Pg. F1]"
1572,hot-tub-time-machine-2-movie,Tom Russo,38,"Compared with last time, the returning team of director Steve Pink and writer Josh Heald practically doodle the gang’s motivations and worse, their surroundings. "
1573,300-rise-of-an-empire-movie,Kyle Smith,63,"Green rules the picture with her nutty stare and her willingness to get nasty in a hot sex scene, but the movie’s main weak point is the Greek general Themistokles."
1574,moscow-on-the-hudson-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"Romantic humanism may not be fashionable in these cynical cinematic times, but few directors reveal the tragicomic lives of ordinary people with such sensitivity and humour."
1575,la-femme-nikita-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,"The talentless but irrepressibly trendy Luc Besson (""Subway,"" ""The Big Blue"") dreamed up this idiotic story that seems vaguely inspired by Kubrick's (not Anthony Burgess's) ""A Clockwork Orange."""
1576,sleeping-beauty-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"Though Julia Leigh's surprisingly dull debut is meant to present the mysteries of a troubled young woman, you're more likely to wonder why its star, Emily Browning, is drawn to such demeaning roles."
1577,cedar-rapids-movie,Steve Persall,83,This movie embraces its inner yokel.
1578,the-mighty-macs-movie,Roger Moore,63,"This tiny Catholic school for women dominated the sport at a turning point in history, and this plucky, old-fashioned sports drama sets the scene and tells the tale with a lot of heart and a dash of wit."
1579,bitter-harvest-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"It’s a history lesson wrapped up in a romance, gallows grim but far too often unnecessarily heavy-handed in a way that drives home the factual historical horrors it portrays while somehow managing to feel like a sizably budgeted but no less maladroit television movie of the week."
1580,step-up-all-in-movie,Mark Jenkins,37,"First-time director Trish Sie, a music-video veteran, is more interested in spectacle than character, as she demonstrates even when nobody’s dancing."
1581,kandahar-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"Watching this film wakes you up; it is a window on an Iran and an Afghanistan we should have taken account of long ago -- seen though a master's eye, felt through a poet's touch."
1582,the-kids-are-all-right-movie,Dana Stevens,100,"The movie we've been waiting for all year: a comedy that doesn't take cheap shots, a drama that doesn't manipulate, a movie of ideas that doesn't preach. It's a rich, layered, juicy film, with quiet revelations punctuated by big laughs."
1583,plunkett-macleane-movie,Daysun Chang,5,"An empty void of tasteless action, formula plot, and dull dialogue set in a sadly under-utilized time period."
1584,loggerheads-movie,Stephen Holden,70,"If it isn't easy being any of the troubled people wandering through the film, Loggerheads makes it easy not only to believe in them, but to care about them as well."
1585,rabbit-hole-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,80,"Director John Cameron Mitchell - adapting David Lindsay-Abaire's play - has a surprisingly deft touch with this admittedly downbeat material; he builds dramatic intensity in subtle layers, rather than slapping it on with a trowel. "
1586,winchester-movie,Jason Solomons,38,"Whichever way you wield it, Winchester is a misfire."
1587,stuart-little-2-movie,Carrie Rickey,63,The moral of this softhearted tale is that family values can rehabilitate and tenderize even the toughest of birds. But you'll forgive me if I liked it less when Stuart smoothed Margalo's feathers than when Snowbell's fundamental cattiness made the fur fly.
1588,precious-based-on-the-novel-push-by-sapphire-movie,A.O. Scott,90,"Nimble and self-assured as Mr. Daniels’s direction may be, he could not make you believe in “Precious” unless you were able to believe in Precious herself. You will."
1589,the-emperors-new-groove-movie,Loren King,88,"A lively, invigorating comedy: a near-perfect mix of fresh characters, well-cast voices, superb visuals, and a fast-paced, fantasy-adventure plot."
1590,transformers-the-last-knight-movie,Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,16,"While the flagrant product placement is dialed back (at least on Bay’s curve) and there’s mercifully 100% less discussion of sexual consent laws this time around, the latest outing suffers from arguably the most fatal flaw a movie about giant fighting robots can: it’s brutally and relentlessly boring from start to finish."
1591,oldboy-movie,Scott Foundas,10,"Put simply, in my humble opinion, Oldboy sucks."
1592,district-9-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Anyone who watches District 9 and doesn't think of Apartheid, Nazis, and Josef Mengele needs to spend some time reading a few history books."
1593,candy-movie,Michael Phillips,63,"The way director and co-adapter Armfield shoots it, the film's awfully pretty in its grimness, in the way ""Leaving Las Vegas"" managed to make train-wreck alcoholism more fake-lyrical than grungy."
1594,matchstick-men-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,67,"Actually, there's one other way to approach Matchstick Men, and that's to forget all about neuroses and con artistry and admire the movie instead for the unsettlingly beautiful directorial study in geographical mood that it is. "
1595,twelve-years-a-slave-movie,Lou Lumenick,100,"Well-meaning films like “Lincoln’’ and “Lee Daniels’ The Butler’’ merely scratch the surface compared to the deep and painful truths laid bare by 12 Years a Slave. It’s about time, Scarlett O’Hara."
1596,aint-them-bodies-saints-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,100,"Visually ravishing, tonally commanding and built around magnetic performances by Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck as Bonnie-and-Clyde doomed lovers, Ain’t Them Bodies Saints is a tragic but not despairing tale of fatal romance set in the Texas hill country in the mid-1970s. It marks the arrival of an immense talent who will be new to most moviegoers – although Lowery is a well-known figure in the indie-film world – and it’s surely one of the best American films of the year."
1597,virus-movie,Bob Graham,25,"No one is likely to claim it's a great, or even good, movie, but it does offer some guilty pleasures."
1598,the-heart-is-deceitful-above-all-things-movie,Duane Byrge,0,Inspirationally impaired and dramatically retarded.
1599,warcraft-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Longtime World of Warcraft players should and likely will storm the cineplex gates, burn the castle down, and salt the earth (and screenwriters) from whence this abomination sprung.

1600,i-daniel-blake-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,"For the iconoclastic film director Ken Loach and his longtime screenwriting collaborator Paul Laverty, I, Daniel Blake represents their most accessible film ever."
1601,cool-it-movie,Mark Jenkins,70,"To devotees of Al Gore's prophecy of a soon-to-be-parboiled Earth, ""Skeptical Environmentalist"" author Bjorn Lomborg is the devil. So what does an ecologically incorrect demon look like? Like an aging Danish surfer dude, it turns out."
1602,head-on-movie,David Ansen,90,"Akin's raw, powerful, multileveled movie takes us places we never expected to go."
1603,the-last-airbender-movie,Scott Bowles,63,"He hasn't mastered the craft yet, but M. Night Shyamalan may be on to something with this action-movie thing."
1604,slither-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"There are times (and plenty of them) when Slither slops over from smart, affectionate homage into unmodulated frat goofiness as Gunn cannibalizes so many horror plots with such high spirits."
1605,monsters-ball-movie,Stephen Hunter,90,The movie's stroke of sheer genius is its wondrous ending.
1606,tosca-movie,Daniel Cariaga,80,"Altogether, this is successful as a film, while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece."
1607,noah-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Noah is no silly action blockbuster with a Biblical pretext. Rather, it's the product of writer-director Darren Aronofsky's vigorous engagement with the Biblical story and what it might mean in our time. "
1608,the-big-picture-1969-movie,Staff (Not Credited),25,"The Big Picture is a failed attempt to spoof the wheelers and dealers behind the scenes in Hollywood. Christopher Guest, who directed and cowrote this diatribe against the inanities of the studio system, has created what amounts to no more than a series of sketches that would probably work better on television than in this prolonged, belabored movie. "
1609,jung-war-in-the-land-of-the-mujaheddin-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,75,"It is an excruciating experience. But then, it would have to be. We're watching the distilled essence of war."
1610,predator-movie,David Sterritt,12,"Arnold Schwarzenegger fights an outer-space monster in a third-world jungle. The monster never has a chance. Neither does the jungle. Neither does the audience. [19 June 1987, Arts & Leisure, p.23]"
1611,here-comes-the-boom-movie,Chris Cabin,0,"As a comedy, the film aims low and manages to miss the mark entirely."
1612,the-paperboy-movie,Rex Reed,0,"This raunchy dreck, cut from the same disposable toilet tissue as the recent trailer-trash creepfest ""Killer Joe,"" is a leap downhill from ""Precious."""
1613,chuck-buck-movie,Ella Taylor,80,"Had this idea been pursued to its conclusion instead of the pat, wishfully ready-for-TV ending we're fed, the movie would be a standout."
1614,king-of-the-corner-movie,Allison Benedikt,63,"Moments of this film reminded me of Alexander Payne's great library of male dysfunction -- ""Election,"" ""About Schmidt,"" ""Sideways"" -- not because King of the Corner actually reaches Payne's plane, but because I wish it had tried."
1615,envy-movie,David Sterritt,75,"The movie works fairly well as a pitch-dark comedy, and very well as a dead-on satire of upward mobility and its discontents."
1616,2012-movie,Keith Phipps,25,2012 is ultimately only about finding new ways to topple monoliths. Only they don’t feel that new.
1617,the-greatest-showman-movie,Steve Persall,100,"The Greatest Showman is the feel-good (and feel good about it) movie every holiday season needs. P.T. Barnum is famous for saying there’s a sucker born every minute and he’s still right. For 105 minutes I’m a sucker for his movie, that may not be the greatest show on Earth but close enough."
1618,true-story-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Franco’s distancing routine helps sink True Story, an already turgid and tone-deaf adaptation of a self-serving memoir by a disgraced New York Times reporter (played by two-time Oscar nominee Jonah Hill) who bonds with a murderer he’s trying to exploit."
1619,speed-racer-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"This toxic admixture of computer-generated frenzy and live-action torpor succeeds in being, almost simultaneously, genuinely painful -- the esthetic equivalent of needles in eyeballs -- and weirdly benumbing, like eye candy laced with lidocaine."
1620,lars-and-the-real-girl-movie,Wesley Morris,88,"When a movie about a guy who orders a sex doll off the Internet can turn vice into virtue, something miraculous has occurred. Lars and the Real Girl achieves that kind of miracle."
1621,easy-a-movie,Randy Cordova,90,"This is the kind of movie about teenagers that an adult audience should embrace. It's simply that good, and Stone is nothing short of wonderful."
1622,mudbound-movie,Jake Cole,88,"As striking as Mudbound's combat scenes are, they largely exist as setup for the postwar-set second half of the film, which scrutinizes the way that the atrocities witnessed in Europe laid bare the unsustainable hypocrisy in America's own bigoted divisions."
1623,ballistic-ecks-vs-sever-movie,J.R. Jones,10,"Before seeing this film I couldn't understand why the producers had given it a subtitle; afterward I realized ""Ecks vs. Sever"" was probably the full script."
1624,grown-ups-2-movie,Sara Stewart,12,"The movie lurches from one gross-out scene to another, flipping the bird at continuity and logic. It honestly seems as if Sandler and his team descended on a random suburb, halfheartedly improvising and moving on when they got bored."
1625,indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"The movie moves. It has action sequences that are so enormous that they won't just wow audiences, but rock them back in their seats and make them laugh at the audacity of it all."
1626,chinatown-movie,Alastair Sooke,100,"Polanski honed the screenplay, turning the picture into one of the towering achievements of 1970s cinema."
1627,transformers-the-last-knight-movie,Christopher Orr,0,"It all culminates, of course, in a cacophonous and interminable final battle involving far too many participants to possibly keep straight."
1628,since-otar-left-movie,J.R. Jones,70,A trio of finely observant performances graces this quiet drama.
1629,hudson-hawk-movie,Kenneth Turan,0,"Even Willis seems a bit bewildered at times, as if asking himself how he managed to get into such a mess. [24 May 1991]"
1630,timecop-movie,Mike Clark,38,"Timecop's conversation piece is the scene in which Van Damme springs into the air amid hand-to-hand combat, finessing a perfect split atop his kitchen counter. Though definitely ooo-and-aaah stuff, it falls short of landing Timecop the 3-star review earned here by Van Damme's Hard Target. [16 Sep 1994, p.5D]"
1631,the-beatles-eight-days-a-week---the-touring-years-movie,Alex McCown,75,"It’s a testament to the buoyancy of the film that such exhausted, well-trod material can still feel fresh. "
1632,margaret-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,30,Rarely has a film with such a great cast and so many moments of terrific writing and such high dramatic goals been so messy and disorganized and fundamentally bad. 
1633,matilda-movie,Gene Siskel,63,I wish more had been made of the power of books versus the power of a studio's special-effects department. 
1634,kill-me-three-times-movie,Nikola Grozdanovic,16,"If it were funnier, perhaps the trite action and insipid characters could be excused, but it isn’t nearly funny enough for that."
1635,cats-dogs-movie,David Sterritt,25,The plot pants so hard -- that it makes less sense than the average pet-food commercial.
1636,where-to-invade-next-movie,Allan Hunter,80,"It is a more stimulating, thought-provoking and entertaining call to arms than anything we are likely to hear from an aspiring President over the next year."
1637,10000-bc-movie,Ty Burr,25,"So, yea, it is a stinker. But it is prophesied that in six months time you shall come across 10,000 B.C.’ in the land of Pay-Per-View. And you shall say: ‘‘Pass the popcorn.’’"
1638,babies-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,65,"The point of Babies, to the extent that it has one beyond allowing us to revel in unstoppable baby cuteness, is to underscore that infants everywhere are more similar than they are different, regardless of what country they’re born and raised in."
1639,u-571-movie,G. Allen Johnson,75,"Certainly it isn't about to give ""Das Boot"" a run for its money - but nevertheless it is irresistible entertainment."
1640,la-dolce-vita-re-release-movie,Shawn Levy,100,Films don't get more essential than this. 
1641,one-direction-this-is-us-movie,Claudia Puig,63,It's misleading to call this a documentary — fan fodder is more like it.
1642,arbitrage-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,80,"Surprisingly entertaining, probably because it uses Wall Street shenanigans and schadenfreude as the backdrop to a crime drama."
1643,8-women-2000-movie,David Sterritt,75,This visually intricate fantasia combines his (Greenaway's) extraordinary cinematic imagination with a story and characters less compelling than those in his best works.
1644,free-fire-movie,Glenn Kenny,80,"Free Fire is an action movie finely tuned to even the most potentially vicious audiences’ tolerances. It is filled with mayhem, but avoids grisly violence — at least until the finale pulls out some gory, and not inapt, punch lines. Luxuriating in disreputability in all the right ways, the film also contains no shortage of profane verbal wit."
1645,the-nutcracker-movie,Tasha Robinson,16,"Nutcracker In 3D doesn't just compound past errors in re-imagining the story. Thanks to a big budget, huge staging, massive overacting, and the non-wonders of post-production 3-D conversion, it adds a wide bevy of new errors. "
1646,the-curious-case-of-benjamin-button-movie,Richard Corliss,100,"This film's manifold pleasures come in a series of small packages, with treats inside as tasty as they are unexpected."
1647,grind-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,25,"Here's what's missing from Casey La Scala's film: Likable characters, a comprehensible script and any semblance of a good time. "
1648,the-raid-redemption-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"When it comes to The Raid: Redemption, there are no pretentions. Pure and simple, this is about violence. As we used to say, ""kickin' ass and takin' names."" "
1649,inherent-vice-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"Only fitfully does the film manage the kind of lift-off as that achieved by Pynchon's often riotous 2009 novel and, most disappointingly, it offers only a pale and narrow physical recreation of such a vibrant place and time."
1650,trixie-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,10,Where's the comedy?
1651,mission-impossible-fallout-movie,Kevin Lally,85,"Fallout is the boldest of a series that has set a very high (sometimes literally so) standard for breathtaking set-pieces. By my count, the new film has at least seven of them—a generous gift to summer audiences from daredevil star Cruise, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood."
1652,girl-most-likely-movie,Rex Reed,38,"The insurmountable problem is that Imogene is not a very original, dynamic or charismatic character, and Kristen Wiig is not a very original, dynamic or charismatic actress. Nobody in this movie is really appealing enough to be much fun. The state of New Jersey should sue."
1653,racer-and-the-jailbird-movie,Glenn Kenny,75,"The work by the two leads is consistently committed, not to mention oozing with old fashioned movie-star charisma.  "
1654,take-movie,Nathan Lee,10,"Subjective or not, the movie is a bore and an eyesore."
1655,surviving-christmas-movie,Carrie Rickey,0,"So bad you're nostalgic for ""Gigli.""  So painful you need an epidural.  So mindless you'll lose yours wondering, ""What were they thinking?"""
1656,where-the-heart-is-movie,Wesley Morris,25,A particularly egregious array of Kodak moments.
1657,foxcatcher-movie,Joe Neumaier,80,"Rare is the drama that plumbs the quirky, unsettling depths of human nature like Foxcatcher. Simultaneously understated and grippingly edgy, this is an arresting examination of naivete, mismatched worlds and old-fashioned American oddness."
1658,into-the-inferno-movie,Stephen Farber,70,"It might be sacrilege to suggest that Herzog could use a more strong-willed collaborator, but this film sometimes turns into a rather misshapen cinematic essay. Nevertheless, you won’t be sorry to witness the apocalyptic images of nature blazing and roaring."
1659,joe-dirt-movie,Jami Bernard,0,"Talk about waste products; think of the time, effort and money that went into this movie."
1660,evil-dead-2013-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,75,Alvarez triumphs because he made one crucial decision: Avoid digital animation and use only practical in-camera special effects. He uses every trick from classic Hollywood and invents a few of his own.
1661,avatar-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"Is it or is it not stupendously friggin' rad? And the answer is yes. For most of the first hour, a good portion of the second, and even many of the 40 minutes left after that, Avatar is stupendously friggin' rad."
1662,the-falcon-and-the-snowman-movie,Nick Schager,75,"Schlesinger’s portrait of his two characters’ scheme, which comes to involve transactions with KGB handler Alex (David Suchet) and unravels courtesy of Andrew’s burgeoning heroin habit, is consistently suspenseful, thanks to swift pacing and a script that mires itself in its protagonists’ confusion and paranoia."
1663,obsessed-movie,Peter Travers,0,"Memo to Beyoncé Knowles: You were so good as Etta James in ""Cadillac Records,"" so why'd you go spoil everything with a rank cheeseball thriller that buries you in clichés and won't even help you dig yourself out?"
1664,the-missing-picture-movie,Peter Keough,88,His film aspires to a poetry about barbarism that will not let us forget.
1665,the-waterboy-movie,Ron Wells,20,A stupid summer movie. 
1666,kangaroo-jack-movie,Joe McGovern,0,"Virtually every shot of the kangaroo was digitally created, and perhaps that was an insurance policy masterstroke. Forcing a real live one to act opposite these co-stars could have easily constituted animal cruelty."
1667,no-stranger-than-love-movie,Roger Moore,38,"It aims for the heart, but misses. It reaches for existential but never manages much more than “twee.”"
1668,mission-to-mars-movie,Bob Graham,25,"Something so sappy, no one would believe me if I told them. It has to be seen to be disbelieved."
1669,schindlers-list-movie,Rick Groen,88,A powerful and affecting piece of work.
1670,good-night-and-good-luck-movie,Michael Sragow,100,"You go to Good Night, and Good Luck expecting inspiration, and you get it. It's also unexpectedly subtle, tense, and challenging, complex both in its take on its subject and in its craftsmanship. So the movie brings you to your feet - and, at times, to tears."
1671,fired-up!-movie,Jan Stuart,10,"Will Gluck directs with frantic, go-for-broke pacing, which is what you do when your reserves of wit are bankrupt."
1672,public-enemies-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"Mann excels at staging the chaotic bank jobs and bloody shootouts that were just a day at the office for Dillinger, but even at 140 minutes the movie is so dense with incident that there isn't much room for cultural comment or character development."
1673,the-pacifier-movie,Sean Axmaker,25,Ultimately this soppy Pacifier sucks.
1674,the-adventures-of-pluto-nash-movie,Kevin Courrier,25,A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of.
1675,made-of-honor-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"Dempsey's pleasant enough, but he hasn't yet learned how to play against a mediocre script's obviousness. Monaghan has, which is gratifying."
1676,the-boy-next-door-movie,Drew Taylor,0,"The entire movie feels like a warning for women of any age: if you act on your desires, you will be punished. And there seems to be no greater punishment than having to watch The Boy Next Door."
1677,starting-out-in-the-evening-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"It's rare to see a movie adaptation in which a filmmaker has taken so much care in translating the odd little qualities that make a particular novel special, to preserve the complex and fragile threads of feeling between characters that are often much easier to grasp on the page."
1678,leap-year-movie,Aaron Hillis,20,"Why, pray tell, do we not get a four-year break between generic, charmless and sexist rom-coms like this on our side of the pond?"
1679,the-lovers-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,30,"There's a veil of artifice clinging to every aspect of The Lovers, a thoroughly unconvincing time-traveling epic costume drama pairing a miscast Josh Hartnett and Bollywood beauty Bipasha Basu."
1680,all-the-money-in-the-world-movie,David Edelstein,70,"It’s a real transformation. I’ve never heard this diction from her (Michelle Williams) before — sharp, with a hint of North Shore (i.e., old money) Long Island and perhaps a Kennedy or two. (The real Gail grew up in San Francisco but was well acquainted with the cadences of the East Coast rich.) Through the tension in her body and intensity of her voice, Williams conveys not just the terror of losing a son but the tragic absurdity of bearing the illustrious name Getty when family ties confer zero power."
1681,bella-movie,Erin Meister,38,"In this bilingual morality movie about love, family, and fate, however, the unpredictability turns out to be highly predictable."
1682,zodiac-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,"This movie sends you into the night thinking, maybe even a little afraid. Bravo, Mr. Fincher."
1683,the-opposite-of-sex-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,20,"Very much like sex. On second thought, make that bad sex. Actually, sexual assault is more like it. It will leave you feeling used, bruised, violated, mistrustful and unclean."
1684,the-battle-of-algiers-re-release-movie,Ella Taylor,90,"A classic of politically engaged filmmaking, based on a book by Saadi Yacef, a former FLN leader who also produced the picture and played a version of himself."
1685,armageddon-movie,Bob Graham,25,There are barrages of fast cuts to distract us from the fact that the director is showing us no real action.
1686,the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-movie,David Sims,85,"With his latest movie, Lanthimos has made a tense, heart-wrenching tale with an admirably askance view of humanity that’s a worthy successor to his prior works."
1687,suburbicon-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,30,"George Clooney’s statement-making black comedy Suburbicon, playing in competition here at the Venice Film Festival, is a misfire on nearly all counts."
1688,the-girl-on-the-train-movie,Mark Jenkins,85,"While the story pivots on an actual girl-who-cried-wolf incident, this elegantly constructed movie is about much more than that."
1689,rock-the-kasbah-movie,Andrew Lowry,20,"On paper, this could have been excellent; as it stands, it’s painful and futile for all involved. Much like the Afghan conflict itself."
1690,burn-after-reading-movie,Marc Mohan,83,"Nothing more and nothing less than a savvy and talented cast having its way with a clever, hilarious script, with absolutely no weighty issues at stake."
1691,i-dreamed-of-africa-movie,Dennis Lim,20,"Hudson keeps the movie rambling and episodic, deferring to the imposing backdrop whenever possible."
1692,birth-movie,Rene Rodriguez,63,The dialogue is sparse but well used -- it's refreshing to see a movie where people don't feel compelled to talk all the time.
1693,pitch-perfect-2-movie,Jesse Hassenger,67,"It’s at once an encore, a postscript, and a fresh start."
1694,serena-movie,Oliver Lyttelton,16,"The film isn't bad enough to be some kind of potential cult classic: it's tedious, with even the stranger moments and plot developments failing to raise the pulse."
1695,the-theory-of-everything-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"The film is striking, at times even piercing, for the way it infiltrates some universal realities of marriage."
1696,im-still-here-movie,Steven Rea,88,"A meditation on a life lived in the public eye, I'm Still Here is strange, riveting, and occasionally appalling stuff, any way you look at it."
1697,man-on-fire-movie,Mike Clark,63,"Not too many R-rated revenge pics depend on ""Uptown Girls'"" Dakota Fanning for the stronger scenes. Yet once the 10-year-old star exits the picture, Man on Fire starts blowing a lot of smoke."
1698,breaking-away-movie,Bob Thomas,88,"Director Peter Yates brings vitality to Steve Tesich's endearing script, avoiding any temptation for cheap shots. The cast is mostly unknown and awfully good, especially Dennis Christopher as a Hoosier turned Italian and Paul Dooley as his exasperated parent. [16 July 1979]"
1699,repo-men-movie,J.R. Jones,0,Has exactly the same premise (Repo! The Genetic Opera).
1700,shrink-movie,Steven Rea,38,A pity-party of Hollywood narcissism.
1701,another-year-movie,Karina Longworth,0,"I haven't seen a film this year that so openly invited me to revile each and every one of its characters-and I reviewed ""The Human Centipede."""
1702,melancholia-movie,Rex Reed,0,"Melancholia is his latest pile of undiluted drivel, nauseatingly filmed by a wonky hand-held camera and featuring a crazy, mismatched ensemble headed by Kirsten Dunst, who won an acting award in Cannes last year for looking totally catatonic. "
1703,borgman-movie,Jordan Hoffman,80,"Borgman‘s crafty, trickster-ish screenplay, always two steps ahead of you, keeps you rooting for clues, enough to put your ethics on temporary hold."
1704,batman-returns-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,63,"The ripe dialogue (''I was their No. 1 son,'' wails the Penguin about the parents who flushed their deformed baby down the sewer, ''and they treated me like No. 2!'') and rich settings decked out in deco can't disguise that little happens. The frantic action circles the same city block, as if trying to find a spot to park. [19 June 1992, p.1D]"
1705,white-irish-drinkers-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"Writer-director John Gray, who created ""Ghost Whisperer"" on TV, is a son of Brooklyn whose love for the borough is as thick as a pint of Guinness, and he keeps finding fresh ways to present familiar plot points."
1706,trainwreck-movie,Kimberley Jones,67,"Trainwreck can be furiously funny. It just goes down too easy. It’s scared of its own sharp edges. The sly raging against the machine of Inside Amy Schumer has gone missing. Here, the rage, curiously, is turned inward."
1707,bug-movie,J.R. Jones,80,"Steppenwolf alumnus Tracy Letts adapted his play into this fearsome horror movie, directed with single-minded claustrophobia by William Friedkin."
1708,gimme-shelter-2014-movie,A.O. Scott,30,The film is more of a pageant than a convincing drama. It’s so determined to deliver its moral that it loses its grip on the reality of its characters.
1709,stomp-the-yard-movie,Michael Ordoña,30,"Yes, stepping is an age-old tradition at historically African American schools, but this smells of desperation; one more misstep for a film with two left feet."
1710,dangerous-liaisons-movie,Mike Clark,75,"The distanced result, screen-adapted by playwright Christopher Hampton, never quite overwhelms you. [21 Dec 1988, Life, p.1D]"
1711,the-men-who-stare-at-goats-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"At the end, as I stumbled back onto the street as disoriented and grateful as a released POW, I thought I'd need a calendar to calculate the length of time I'd been away."
1712,take-the-lead-movie,Peter Travers,63,"Inspired by a true story (translation: a lot of it is made up), the movie shucks its corn straight from the cob. But it's no less engaging for that, thanks to the enthusiasm of the young cast and the fusion of classic dance with hip-hop moves courtesy of Rich and Tone Talauega."
1713,the-forest-movie,Alonso Duralde,10,"The accusations of cultural tone-deafness wind up being fairly moot, since The Forest turns out to be so generally inept and non-scary that to boycott it would give the film more attention than it deserves. "
1714,in-out-movie,Robert Wilonsky,70,Klein's the perfect actor to play Howard--a man so actory he probably signs his checks in that thin movie-poster type. 
1715,little-fockers-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"They kill me, these guys. No, seriously. If they make any more of these movies, they might as well kill me."
1716,citizen-kane-1941-movie,James Berardinelli,100,"While I acknowledge that Kane is a seminal masterpiece, I don't think it's the greatest motion picture of all time. Even so, there's no denying the debt that the movie industry owes to Welles and his debut feature. Motion picture archives and collections across the world would be poorer without copies of this film, which will forever be recognized as a defining example of American cinema. "
1717,song-of-the-sea-movie,Carson Lund,75,"Even as it entertains increasingly far-fetched detours, the film's folkloric narrative offers an ideal vehicle for this pictorial play."
1718,drop-dead-gorgeous-movie,Wesley Morris,25,"It should be renamed ""Drop Dead Ghetto"" and hauled off to the ""Jerry Springer"" hall of shame."
1719,get-out-movie,Richard Brody,100,"Peele’s perfectly tuned cast and deft camera work unleash his uproarious humor along with his political fury; with his first film, he’s already an American Buñuel"
1720,the-dark-knight-movie,Richard Corliss,100,"Beyond dark. It's as black -- and teeming and toxic --  as the mind of the Joker. ""Batman Begins,"" the 2005 film that launched Nolan's series, was a mere five-finger exercise. This is the full symphony."
1721,prisoners-movie,Rex Reed,100,"When it comes to thrillers, this one is as good as it gets. Not for the squeamish, but for anyone who loves movies, it’s too exhilarating to miss."
1722,the-martian-movie,Mike D'Angelo,83,"At its heart, The Martian is an unapologetically stirring celebration of our ability, as a species, to solve even the most daunting problems via rational thought, step by step by step. It’s basically ""Human Ingenuity: The Movie."""
1723,bats-movie,M. V. Moorhead,20,"A work of hilarious, nearly Ed Wood-worthy ineptitude."
1724,short-cuts-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"Some movies can lay claim to being the best thing around in a week, a month, a year. Robert Altman's Short Cuts is closer to being one of the all-time bests, among the finest American films since the advent of sound. [22 Oct 1993]"
1725,the-best-and-the-brightest-movie,Aaron Hillis,10,"Drearily shot with cheesy skyline pans, oppressively scored with Hallmark cutesiness, and oddly filled with filthy one-liners. "
1726,white-noise-movie,Michael Sragow,25,"Dramatically, it's a ghoul's parade of grieving folk finding solace and then danger through a tenuous connection to the after-life."
1727,baby-geniuses-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,The hokey dialogue and witless physical gags keep everything painful and hectoring.
1728,friend-request-movie,Roger Moore,25,"With no real suspense and little empathy, Friend Request devolves into your standard horror cast-killer time-killer. There are more frights in the trailers for upcoming Halloween horror films preceding this — “Jigsaw” and “Happy Death Day” among them."
1729,city-slickers-ii-the-legend-of-curlys-gold-movie,Jay Boyar,25,"City Slickers II is not merely one of the worst movies of the year. It's one of the worst movie sequels of all time - and, by the way, one of the least necessary. [10 June 1994, p.21]"
1730,the-trip-2011-movie,John Anderson,90,"Michael Winterbottom's The Trip is about 20 minutes too long, but the other 90 are among the funniest in recent memory. "
1731,victor-frankenstein-movie,Kyle Smith,0,"By going exactly where you think it’s going, Victor Frankenstein doesn’t so much invent a fresh origins story as it essentially repeats, with a few uninteresting new details, all the same stuff we’ve seen in the other 457 Frankenstein movies."
1732,your-highness-movie,Peter Debruge,10,That skunky smell emanating from Your Highness ain't pot; it's the stink of miscalculation that surrounds an inside joke gone awry.
1733,gloomy-sunday-movie,Derek Elley,70,"The iconic '30s song ""Gloomy Sunday"" gets a distinctive celluloid setting in this well-played, cleverly scripted pic in which music and character are inextricably combined."
1734,hollow-man-movie,Carrie Rickey,38,Verhoeven's most deeply disturbing film yet.
1735,capturing-the-friedmans-movie,Edward Guthmann,100,A superb documentary.
1736,tristana-re-release-movie,Dave Kehr,100,"Buñuel conjures with Freudian imagery, outrageous humor, and a quiet, lyrical camera style to create one of his most complex and complete works, a film that continues to disturb and transfix."
1737,the-big-sick-movie,Geoff Berkshire,90,"Comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani and writer Emily V. Gordon mine their personal history for laughs, heartache, and hard-earned insight in The Big Sick, a film that’s by turns romantic, rueful, and hilarious."
1738,terminal-movie,David Edelstein,20,"What’s Terminal about? It’s about 90 minutes. That’s a cheap shot, but since the film doesn’t establish a baseline of reality, it’s hard to pick out a premise. It’s a series of playlets stitched together with the seams hanging out."
1739,chronicle-2012-movie,Manohla Dargis,70,"Mr. DeHaan, whose vulnerability and physical awkwardness here can evoke the young Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" is invaluable. Mr. Russell and Mr. Jordan are as likable as their characters, but it's Mr. DeHaan who pulls you uneasily in. "
1740,conan-the-barbarian-2011-movie,Rick Groen,38,"In today's cultural climate, any remake of Conan the Barbarian can only be considered (a) redundant or (b) a cruel case of rubbing salt in our cinematic wounds. Either way, it ain't a pretty sight – in fact, it's downright barbaric. "
1741,soylent-green-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"A good, solid science-fiction movie, and a little more. "
1742,the-rite-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"Terminally silly, even more so for being ""inspired by actual events."""
1743,mission-impossible-fallout-movie,Richard Roeper,88,"“Fallout” just might be the best of the franchise, and what a rare thing that is for a long-running series."
1744,central-station-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"For Fernanda Montenegro, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Italy's late Giulietta Masina (Federico Fellini's wife and frequent star) in appearance and talent, ""Central Station"" is a personal triumph and a rich cinematic experience."
1745,gi-joe-the-rise-of-cobra-movie,Chris Nashawaty,25,"Don't go expecting an escapist night at the movies; go expecting to be cudgeled into numb, drooling submission."
1746,legends-of-the-fall-movie,Amy Gamerman,0,"Nobody fares well in this movie about sibling rivalry, doomed love and fringed suede. [05 Jan 1995]"
1747,mystery-alaska-movie,Cody Clark,29,Has its share of small pleasures.
1748,jack-and-jill-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,It's pretty sad if you're a comic and Al Pacino is the funniest thing in your movie.
1749,wiener-dog-movie,Jordan Raup,83,"With Wiener-Dog, Solondz is perhaps at his most evidently candid, showing all the different, damaged people that can enter and exit one’s life, and what our mutually shared, inevitable destination will be."
1750,the-boxer-movie,Edward Guthmann,100,"It's a tribute to Day-Lewis that he can play a character like Danny -- cautious, withdrawn, inarticulate -- and endow him an eloquence and grace that aren't dependent on language. Without him, The Boxer might still be a powerful tale of loyalty and love, with a core of moral complexity; with Day-Lewis in the lead, it approaches greatness."
1751,inside-job-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,It is a damning indictment of the individuals and institutions who made money while customers lost their shirts.
1752,winnie-the-pooh-movie,Keith Uhlich,80,"It never feels as if we're watching a brand-name cash-grab, but instead as if we're participating in an endlessly imaginative afternoon of play. "
1753,the-avengers-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"In this movie, the sense of charm has been obliterated."
1754,the-road-movie,Marc Savlov,67,The Road deviates from McCarthy's original text via a series of flashbacks to the man's pre-apocalyptic life with the woman (Theron) who both leaves her family behind and is in turn left behind by them.
1755,all-about-my-mother-movie,Kevin Maynard,90,"The most heartfelt tribute to women -- specifically, actresses -- he's (Almodovar) ever made."
1756,dont-come-knocking-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,"There's something a little absurd about this story, but for me, it's endearingly goofy."
1757,two-weeks-notice-movie,Maitland McDonagh,30,"Coarse, cliched and clunky."
1758,sweet-november-movie,Hazel-Dawn Dumpert,20,This feeble remake offers little more than two pretty and willing leads who nonetheless can't hide their embarrassment over being set up as distractions to hide the film's thorough lack of coherence and appeal.
1759,pitch-perfect-3-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,And then there’s the real problem with Pitch Perfect 3: The best thing about the first movie — the singing — feels like an afterthought.
1760,the-hobbit-there-and-back-again-movie,Drew McWeeny,83,"By focusing on a few key emotional arcs instead of making it about every shot being the BIGGEST THING OF ALL TIME, Jackson gives the battle a sense of urgency that builds and ebbs, builds and ebbs."
1761,soapdish-movie,Staff (Not Credited),70,Soapdish aims at a satiric target as big as a Macy’s float and intermittently hits it. Sally Field and Kevin Kline play a feuding pair of romantically involved soap opera stars in this broad but amiable sendup of daytime TV.
1762,grown-ups-2-movie,Andrew Barker,10,"Among the slackest, laziest, least movie-like movies released by a major studio in the last decade, Grown Ups 2 is perhaps the closest Hollywood has yet come to making “Ow! My Balls!” seem like a plausible future project."
1763,new-best-friend-movie,Rick Groen,0,"Calls itself a movie. It has words and pictures like a movie, and will appear in theatres like a movie, and will damn sure charge admission like a movie. But, truth be told, that's pretty much where the resemblance stops."
1764,truth-or-dare-movie,John Fink,25,"A game of Truth or Dare can actually be a great way to get to know each other, the only problem here is that these characters are so paper thin, that it’s hard to care what secrets they may hide."
1765,93queen-movie,Roger Moore,75,Here’s a “feel good” film that puts us through our share of feeling bad before it delivers its triumph.
1766,henry-poole-is-here-movie,Marc Mohan,33,"Every so often there's a tabloid news story about the Virgin Mary seen in a piece of toast or Mother Teresa on a tortilla, and most of us equate them with Elvis sightings. This film is for the rest."
1767,mom-and-dad-movie,Jared Mobarak,67,"There’s also some commentary about twenty-first century technology and cellphone culture, but I don’t think Taylor goes far enough to make it more than throwaway insight soon forgotten for crazed violence. As far as the latter goes, Mom and Dad delivers crazy in an exciting way that never bores."
1768,bottle-rocket-movie,Steven Rea,88,"This is a movie about friendship, about foolhardy endeavors that get your adrenaline going and make you feel life buzzing in your toes. Written with wit and concision and remarkable confidence, Bottle Rocket is a joyride worth taking."
1769,artificial-intelligence-ai-movie,David Ansen,90,"The result is fascinating -- a rich, strange, problematical movie full of wild tonal shifts and bravura moviemaking."
1770,blackhat-movie,Rodrigo Perez,83,"Blackhat is a meticulous and exacting procedural, as obsessive with its hunt for its intangible antagonist as Mann’s compulsive desire to appreciate the flow of 1s and 0s in the virtual space. It’s chockablock with technobabble and jargon that may alienate the average viewer, but Mann’s secret weapon is his infectious fascination with the subject. The movie is like a conductive surface for his unmitigated zeal, and its potency is viral."
1771,anonymous-2011-movie,Dana Stevens,30,What's disappointing about Anonymous is that it isn't dumb enough. 
1772,the-change-up-movie,Steve Persall,0,"The Change-Up is the ""Human Centipede"" of gag-me comedies."
1773,310-to-yuma-movie,Connie Ogle,100,"The new version is a glorious, thrilling throwback that never sacrifices its solid roots in the western genre despite a sharp modern update that actually improves on the original."
1774,turn-it-up-movie,John Patterson,10,"Gormless, gutless little home movie."
1775,rock-the-kasbah-movie,Ty Burr,12,"Rock the Kasbah is a pandering, poorly assembled botch that thinks it’s playing fair by Afghan popular culture but only manages to add insult to the countless other injuries inflicted upon that country. If it were any worse, they’d be screening it as evidence at The Hague."
1776,dark-crimes-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Carrey doesn’t deliver any sizzle in this role. Csokas chews him right out of their scenes, and the always soulful Gainsbourg (“Nymphomaniac,” “Antichrist”) lets us think we’re looking right into her horrific past, even if this dull, obvious “mystery” doesn’t seem worthy of any of their talents."
1777,support-the-girls-movie,Justin Chang,90,"At a little over 90 minutes, Support the Girls has the brash trappings, if not the longevity, of a “Cheers”-style sitcom, and its generous humor is always in productive play with a tough, flinty realism."
1778,whats-the-worst-that-could-happen-movie,Paul Malcolm,20,Comes off as a desperate attempt to breathe life into dull proceedings.
1779,cold-war-movie,Phil de Semlyen,100,"The Polish filmmaker has conjured a dazzling, painful, universal odyssey through the human heart and all its strange compulsions. It could be the most achingly romantic film you’ll see this year, or just a really painful reminder of the one that got away."
1780,book-club-movie,Dennis Harvey,30,"Really, it’s sad that the best Hollywood can come up with for so much seasoned talent is this stale shake-and-bake combining upscale-lifestyle porn with some tepid smirky humor."
1781,rushmore-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"With its dry, throwaway humor and constant stream of chuckles, it creates its own category of stealth comedy."
1782,the-counselor-movie,Richard Roeper,100,The Counselor achieves the almost unheard-of daily double of giving us the most outrageous sex scene of the year AND the most unforgettably brutal murder of the year. This is a badass journey from start to finish.
1783,the-killer-elite-movie,Nathan Rabin,33,"This clumsy action movie feels too generic to be real. The film attempts to add an element of sophisticated sociopolitical commentary to the typical Jason Statham head-busting shoot-'em-up, but only ends up draining it of visceral thrills."
1784,17-again-movie,Roger Moore,63,"As a remake of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""Back to the Future,"" the movies it borrows from most heavily, the relive-your-senior-year comedy 17 Again falls a little short of the mark. But as a funny, sweet and smart star vehicle tailored for Zac ""High School Musical"" Efron, it's right on the money."
1785,raw-movie,Jeffrey Bloomer,90,"The most delicious part of Raw is its rich metaphorical life. Rather than playing like a gross-out sideshow, the movie has viscera-streaked things to say about the terrors of young womanhood, sisterly initiation, French racism, the gruesome traditions of veterinary science, and the uneasy bond between women and gay men."
1786,stories-we-tell-movie,Manohla Dargis,100,"Stories We Tell has a number of transparent virtues, including its humor and formal design, although its most admirable quality is the deep sense of personal ethics that frames Ms. Polley’s filmmaking choices."
1787,the-virgin-suicides-movie,Gemma Files,90,"Subtle, strange, off-putting, fascinating."
1788,compliance-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"This nasty little bottom-feeder of a film is too condescending to be trusted, too manipulative to be believed, too turgid to be enjoyed, too shameless to be endured and, before and after everything else, too inept to make its misanthropic case."
1789,are-you-here-movie,Tomas Hachard,12,"The female characters on Mad Men are probably the show's strongest asset, but here they're hollow to the point of insult."
1790,killers-movie,Rob Nelson,10,"Bullets fly and jokes land with a thud in Killers, a deadly dull hubby's-a-hit man farce that alternately resembles a knockoff of 2005's ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and a rehash of ""Knight & Day"" avant la lettre ."
1791,american-psycho-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"Funny, pungent, and weirdly gripping."
1792,restrepo-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,85,The low-key quality of the filmmaking in Restrepo only intensifies the reality of how much these kids are risking.
1793,gravity-movie,Steve Persall,100,"Gravity is a game-changer like ""Avatar"" in the realm of digital 3-D special effects, inventing trickeries to be applied by future filmmakers and possibly never improved upon. Yet its spirit is closer to Avatar's smarter descendants, ""Hugo"" and ""Life of Pi,"" with the gimmicks embellishing, not driving, the material. Less Cameron, more Kubrick."
1794,big-sky-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,30,Director Grau seems to be making up the film as he goes along — never a good idea when tackling the sort of genre piece that requires building tension and some semblance of dread to succeed.
1795,behind-enemy-lines-movie,Kim Morgan,67,"Although at times ridiculous, Behind Enemy Lines nevertheless thrills, inspires."
1796,my-favorite-martian-movie,Staff (Not Credited),10,"This isn’t a movie, it’s an outline for Happy Meals and theme park rides. Avoid at all costs."
1797,primary-colors-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,Such a smart and savvy piece of work it encourages us to feel we're eavesdropping on history.
1798,54-movie,Charles Taylor,30,"It's a flat, clumsy piece of filmmaking. When Phillippe and Ward are in bed, the shots are so badly matched that I believed they were having sex, just not with each other. "
1799,the-trip-to-italy-movie,Steve Davis,78,"By the end of this affable little film, you’ll likely crave a bowl of fresh-made pasta in seafood sauce, a glass of Frascati, and a room with a view on the Amalfi coast. (Sigh.) "
1800,cadillac-records-movie,Peter Rainer,83,The film suffers at times from biopic-itis – the narrative unfolds with the requisite heartbreak carefully apportioned – but it's always eye-catching.
1801,hamlet-2000-movie,Kevin Maynard,68,"Almereyda never plays up the gimmickry at the expense of the performances, and as a result, his movie largely succeeds, despite an overabundance of pretentious pokes at our consumer culture and the risky casting of Ethan Hawke in the lead role."
1802,white-noise-movie,James Berardinelli,25,"White Noise has nothing. You'll have a better time staying home, tuning your TV to a station that doesn't carry a local signal, and staring."
1803,jack-and-jill-movie,Mary Pols,0,More than 24 hours has passed since I watched the new Adam Sandler movie Jack and Jill and I am still dead inside. It made me feel as if comedy itself were a dirty thing.
1804,keeping-up-with-the-joneses-movie,Alan Zilberman,37,"Mottola and LeSieur seem to have actively avoided the pursuit of wisdom, settling for broad gags — and the occasional explosion — instead."
1805,chapter-27-movie,Duane Byrge,70,"High praise to the cast and crew. Jared Leto is mesmeric as the bloated, deranged Chapman. It's a brilliantly measured performance, evincing the tale of a madman through his own awful rhyme and reason."
1806,time-and-tide-movie,Kim Morgan,83,"A lyrical, exciting adrenaline rush."
1807,cheri-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"Now that she's past 50, can we all stop holding Michelle Pfeiffer's looks against her and just admit that she's a great actress?"
1808,october-baby-movie,Alison Willmore,0,This is no mere tale of redemption or reaffirming of faith; this is a film with an extreme agenda.
1809,cousin-jules-movie,Jesse Cataldo,88,"It's a bit reductive in terms of a personal portrait, but this is a film that's not concerned with telling the story of a man, instead making him a representative symbol of a mostly bygone way of life, a reminder of both the fleeting nature of individual experience and the steady patterns of a broader human existence."
1810,sur-mes-levres-movie,Rick Groen,63,"Offers you the ostensible bargain of two movies in one -- a character study at the outset and the crime caper that follows. The first picture is intriguing, the second stinks."
1811,grown-ups-2-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,16,"Largely free of Sandler’s usual schmaltz and lame romance, it’s pure plotless, grotesque high jinks, bizarre and inept in a way that’s fascinating without ever being all that funny."
1812,mother-of-george-movie,Godfrey Cheshire,75,The result is a work in which style and story unite to create a singularly mesmerizing look at a culture within a culture. 
1813,volver-movie,Jenni Miller,88,"Each scene is lovingly crafted, with bright colors and the beautiful scenery of La Mancha, the mellifluous cadences of Castilian Spanish, and of course the faces, young and old, of each actress."
1814,kidnapping-mr-heineken-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"A dull, trite thriller."
1815,28-days-later-movie,William Arnold,75,Boyle gives us some truly harrowing sequences and a succession of images that stick in the mind like a bad dream.
1816,citizen-jane-battle-for-the-city-movie,Alex Bozilovic,88,"As a history of this war of ideas and as an introduction to Jacobs, the film is essential. But it also pivots toward a great challenge: today’s global urbanization. "
1817,fast-food-nation-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"If I wanted to spend $10.75 making myself sick, I'd buy a bottle of cheap tequila."
1818,tokyo!-movie,Mark Olsen,70,A fun jaunt around the city and a quick tour of the preoccupations of three leading directors? Now there's a bargain.
1819,the-cell-movie,Kenneth Turan,0,"Some movies make you sorry you've seen them, and The Cell is one of those. Creepy and horrific, it's a torture chamber film."
1820,the-rider-movie,Kate Erbland,91,"Utilizing a cast of non-actors — most of whom are tasked with playing versions of themselves, in a story pulled from their lives — Zhao’s film derives its power from the truth that both drives it and inspires it, and the final result is a wholly unique slice-of-life drama."
1821,gloria-2013-movie,David Parkinson,80,The mesmerising García and sensitive direction by Lelio light up this delicate yet spiky drama. Terrific stuff from both Chileans. 
1822,music-and-lyrics-movie,Ella Taylor,30,"Among its other sins, the disposable romantic comedy Music and Lyrics fluffs a golden opportunity to make hay with Grant's dark side."
1823,toy-story-3-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,The third film of the trilogy turns out to be gorgeously joyous and deeply felt.
1824,untraceable-movie,Peter Travers,0,Talk about your pious frauds. I've got a better way to show your disgust for Internet scum: Don't see Untraceable.
1825,the-dying-gaul-movie,Jack Mathews,38,These are three characters in search of a moral pulse.
1826,the-secret-of-nimh-movie,Staff (Not Credited),75,"The Secret of NIMH folds a commentary on the evils of animal experimentation and a salute to the bravery of single moms into a smart, gripping action-adventure framework, becoming an underappreciated touchstone for sensitive Eighties kids. "
1827,the-cook-the-thief-his-wife-her-lover-movie,Kevin Thomas,30,"Greenaway is a man of distinctive ideas and insights who this time out has expended his abilities and perceptions -- and those of many others -- on an exercise in grossness that depresses rather than enlarges the human spirit. The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover is sensational, all right, but hardly entertaining. [13 Apr 1990, p.F12]"
1828,happy-go-lucky-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"It is that rare film that is equal parts entertaining, life-affirming and thought-provoking."
1829,the-hobbit-there-and-back-again-movie,Marc Savlov,78,"The performances have remained continuously excellent throughout The Hobbit trilogy, and they remain so here; likewise Howard Shore’s score, which is particularly righteous – bloodthirsty when it needs to be, keening when a particularly major character is cut down."
1830,the-village-movie,Michael Wilmington,63,"A big, creepy dollhouse of a movie--a sometimes engrossing shocker with a surprise ending that isn't especially shocking or surprising."
1831,hollow-man-movie,Dana Stevens,10,"Endure the long, slow, unraveling of this movie, which can't even muster the intelligence to be pretentious or the bravado to be amusingly bad."
1832,crossroads-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,0,"Go see Crossroads if you want to hear Britney sing or see her wear next-to-nothing. But otherwise, avoid this train wreck at all costs."
1833,darling-companion-movie,Ella Taylor,30,"The movie uses the mutt's disappearance as a frame on which to hang a well-worn package of fatally mild domestic disorder, then resolve it in what feels like real time. Let's just say that the dog gets the best lines."
1834,cedar-rapids-movie,David Edelstein,70,"It helps that Reilly is the opposite of a slob-comic. With his hangdog melancholy, he makes even the nonstop cunnilingus allusions poignant-the product of emotional longing. "
1835,17-again-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"Pleasant, harmless PG-13 entertainment, with a plot a little more surprising and acting a little better than I expected."
1836,marjorie-prime-movie,Ian Freer,80,"A high-concept idea with a low concept approach, Marjorie Prime is cerebral, talk-driven sci-fi lit up by a compelling exploration of big ideas and across-the-board strong performances from the small cast (especially Smith). A treat for the brain and soul."
1837,excess-baggage-movie,Maitland McDonagh,20,"The first fruit of wunderkinder Alicia Silverstone's First Kiss Productions, this muddled thriller-cum-romantic comedy of errors suggests that she might want to lay off the producing for a few years."
1838,keep-the-river-on-your-right-a-modern-cannibal-tale-movie,Edward Guthmann,100,The film underscores the paradox in this man's life: the split between the mild-mannered New Yorker and the fearless vagabond who joined an Arakmbut hunting raid.
1839,the-meg-movie,Demetrios Matheou,70,"It’s a likeable popcorn movie, with some good monster moments, an engaging international cast and Jon Turteltaub helming a family-friendly balance of laughter and mayhem."
1840,hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,Long story short: Hunt for the Wilderpeople is a terrific movie and you should do whatever you can to see it.
1841,pollock-movie,Peter Brunette,90,"Irrespective of whether Pollock, as a movie, is any good -- and it is very, very good -- it's clear that Ed Harris was born to play the lead role."

1843,your-sisters-sister-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,This extremely well-acted dramatic farce of grief and betrayal actually has a resonance beyond its target demographic.
1844,due-date-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,The comedy never really takes off because it's phony.
1845,the-dead-girl-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,70,"By the movie's end, writer-director Karen Moncrieff's The Dead Girl delivers considerable emotional impact. But that doesn't mean you've enjoyed the journey."
1846,patti-cake-movie,Richard Roeper,75,"Macdonald is an absolute force as the twentysomething Patricia Dombrowski, who wakes up every morning determined and upbeat, even though her life path already looks to be a series of dead ends."
1847,high-rise-2015-movie,Rex Reed,0,"A trash wallow in sex, nudity, violence, cruelty to animals and the skewering of contemporary society, it will predictably appeal to kids and art house patrons who crave the cinematic roller coaster rides of outrage and chaos that lead to downright anarchy. Saner, more rational minds are advised to look elsewhere."
1848,beatriz-at-dinner-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,"Deftly balances subtle humor with sharp observations about class, wealth and power. "
1849,17-again-movie,Andrea Gronvall,70,The ancient body-switching premise is animated by a breezy script that briefly addresses some of its darker implications.
1850,spider-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,90,"Spider is not a pulse-quickening experience, but Fiennes's art makes it engrossing."
1851,the-last-of-robin-hood-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,12,"The problem — and wow, it's a big one — is that none of these actors have material firm enough to shape into a bona fide performance. "
1852,for-love-of-the-game-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,For the first 100 minutes or so I found this hokey but serviceable; after that my watch became more meaningful than anything I could locate on-screen.

1854,louder-than-bombs-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,88,"Along with his regular co-writer Eskil Vogt, Trier has crafted a profoundly beautiful and strange meditation on secrets, lies, dreams, memories and misunderstanding."
1855,a-cure-for-wellness-movie,Brad Wheeler,38,"The problem is that somewhere around the middle of the film, one begins to realize it probably isn’t going any place worthwhile."
1856,the-lost-boys-movie,Staff (Not Credited),10,The Lost Boys is a horrifically dreadful vampire teensploitation entry that daringly advances the theory that all those missing children pictured on garbage bags and milk cartons are actually the victims of bloodsucking bikers.
1857,apollo-18-movie,Joel Brown,38,Contains nothing original or over-the-top enough to make it a real scream fest. For most horror fans it will be kind of a snooze.
1858,a-quiet-place-movie,Adi Robertson,85,"The film hits all the necessary beats for a straightforward horror film in an eerie post-apocalyptic setting. But it’s more effective as a portrait of four people who have constructed a deceptively peaceful life under the constant, inescapable threat of death."
1859,house-of-the-sleeping-beauties-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,10,"Not even the august presence of Maximilian Schell can dispel the odor of fusty smut that clings to House of the Sleeping Beauties, a clammy meditation on sex, death and the endless fascination of unclothed innocence."
1860,the-art-of-getting-by-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,33,"Old Holden would call the whole movie phony, and I agree, if you want to know the truth. "
1861,the-to-do-list-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"The movie is pleasingly vulgar and, although there's no nudity, the whole thing is about sex."

1863,dogtooth-movie,Scott Tobias,100,"It's an exhilaratingly unpredictable experience, and not an easy one to shake."
1864,all-or-nothing-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,The wealth of behavioral detail and observational humor make for some rewarding drama that will resonate with many viewers.
1865,connie-and-carla-movie,David Ng,10,"One suspects Vardalos's movies aren't written as much as up-chucked, the result of all-night binges on SnackWells and Oxygen network reruns."
1866,dear-john-movie,Kimberley Jones,30,"He is meant to be brooding, I think, but Tatum’s vague features read more “meathead” than anguished young lover. He has to carry the film, but he’s the least interesting thing going on here."

1871,timeline-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"As Timeline so adequately proves, not every bestseller will render a good film. "
1872,beautiful-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"It manages to find an almost pitch-perfect accumulation of ill-matched tones, sheer grotesquerie, near-heroic absurdity and self-canceling folly."
1873,white-hotel-movie,Mark Holcomb,10,"Griffin and Solvang's obliviousness, and the filmmakers' habit of mugging condescendingly while conducting interviews doesn't help either."
1874,the-brown-bunny-movie,Connie Ogle,0,"There are not enough synonyms for ''bad'' to describe the pretension and utter banality of the masturbatory The Brown Bunny, a film so exhaustively awful even its creator Vincent Gallo once disavowed it."
1875,in-this-world-movie,Ella Taylor,80,"The movie's staccato pacing, lent emphasis by Dario Marianelli's haunting score, evokes the cycles of tedium and terror that make the journey so unnerving. "
1876,sex-and-broadcasting-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,70,"Professionally comfortable with improvising, the D.J.s make for affable company, and it’s amusing to watch radio from behind the scenes. But a tinge of melancholy also hovers over the movie."
1877,megamind-movie,Tasha Robinson,83,"There's nothing wrong with animation aimed at adults, but this may be the first kids' movie that throws fewer bones to its supposed intended viewers than to their parents."

1881,127-hours-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,"127 Hours is based on Ralston's memoir, and it's a really good movie because director Danny Boyle is a genius."

1883,adanggaman-movie,Loren King,88,"The film's disturbing images are presented matter-of-factly, which makes them more powerful, not less."
1884,monster-house-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,70,"The three neighborhood kids who venture inside this toothy trap are wittily conceived (as are other characters, like a goth babysitter), but though the overall conception suggests Hayao Miyazaki's ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" the frenetic pacing seems as American as an apple pie in your face."
1885,everybody-loves-whales-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,12,"Any goodwill it boasts is terminally suppressed, buried beneath a layer of bullshit as thick as blubber. "
1886,nocturnal-animals-movie,Fionnuala Halligan,70,"As a screenwriter, Ford has made some brave choices in a difficult, complex adaptation. As a director, though, he veers between delivering far too much, and yet not quite enough."
1887,how-to-train-your-dragon-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"Rouses you in conventional ways, but it's also the rare animated film that uses 3-D for its breathtaking spatial and emotional possibilities."
1888,lake-city-movie,Michelle Orange,30,Added to the general torpidity and twangy tropes of this Southern family drama is the discomfort of watching a natural actor (Garity) force it.
1889,the-guardians-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"The performances are extraordinary, as they often are in Beauvois’ films, with Baye a study in quiet suffering and Bry wonderfully enigmatic — seemingly simple, but hinting at a soul capable of expansion and adaptation."

1891,click-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,An abomination.
1892,gemini-movie,G. Allen Johnson,25,"It is such a soul-killing exercise in narcissism — and not a very smart thriller, either — that yeah, you can buy into the notion that Tinseltown is a total drag."
1893,seabiscuit-movie,Don R. Lewis,70,"More than ""Rocky"" on a horse track. It's a moving story about people and how their lives intersect at just the right time. It's also a simple story about second chances."

1895,where-the-heart-is-movie,Steve Simels,30,"To be fair, this could have been worse."
1896,garfield-a-tail-of-two-kitties-movie,Janice Page,38,"Though Murray and Curry gamely deliver some chuckle-worthy one-liners along the way, they're mostly leashed to material as moldy and uninspired as the ""Jeffersons"" theme song."
1897,heist-movie,David Denby,70,"Hackman works with a joyous authority that seems to come out of the experience of the character he's playing.  He liberates David Mamet from David Mamet.  [12 Nov 2001, p. 139]"

1899,sound-city-movie,Howard Cohen,75,"Grohl's appreciation for the inhabitants of this dingy demimonde, from the artists to the secretaries at the front desk, makes Sound City an infectious and sincere Valentine to a rapidly disappearing art form."
1900,the-prince-of-tides-movie,Peter Travers,38,"Even the stalwart Nolte drowns in the laughable idiocy of the Wingo-Lowenstein love affair, which lifts Tides to the fiasco class. "
1901,stella-movie,Rita Kempley,20,"Basically ""Beaches"" without Hershey and the salt water. This insipid suck-face-athon provokes the gag reflex. "
1902,sahara-movie,Janice Page,38,"In the end, the thing that Cussler's fans will probably object to most is the nonsensical way Sahara manhandles his story."

1904,knockaround-guys-movie,Lawrence Van Gelder,20,"When it comes to father, sons and mob life, stick to ""The Godfather."""
1905,city-of-life-and-death-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"Despite its blunt characterizations and simplifications, City of Life and Death, through the inexorable pileup of gruesome detail, achieves an epic vision of horror."

1907,gosford-park-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,90,"There are even more characters of interest here than in ""Nashville."""
1908,it-movie,Aja Romano,80,"Muschietti’s largely faithful adaptation of King’s story relies not on nostalgia for its emotional underpinnings, but rather a keen sense of the present moment in all its deep tensions and ugliness."
1909,mean-creek-movie,Alan Morrison,80,Estes enriches the plot by refusing to present each character's emotional dilemmas in black-and-white terms.
1910,a-mighty-wind-movie,Richard Corliss,90,The sweetest and funniest of Guest's true-life fake-umentaries.
1911,life-or-something-like-it-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Every now and then, though, a movie comes up with a scene of surpassing stupidity, and then builds from that defining moment to a climax of perfect ineptitude. Life or Something Like It is such an achievement."
1912,mom-and-dad-movie,Rex Reed,0,"If ""Mother"" is still the worst abomination ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting and undeserving public, Mom and Dad is at least the perfect companion piece. "
1913,hansel-and-gretel-witch-hunters-movie,Robert Abele,10,"What galls is that for all the perspiration in jazzing up an old yarn, there's not a whiff of originality in how Wirkola engages with the perverse pleasures enshrined by the Grimm brothers, two of their era's shrewdest storytellers."
1914,intact-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,20,The film's a swell way of torturing yourself for 108 minutes. 
1915,the-meddler-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,Scafaria doesn’t solve everyone’s problems or end with a miraculous change of mind or heart. She writes credible situations...and characters in whom we can believe.
1916,gettin-the-mans-foot-outta-your-baadasssss!-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,"While the younger Van Peebles certainly looks the part, Baadasssss! never feels like anything more than kids playing dress-up."
1917,the-debt-movie,Rick Groen,63,"Political thrillers with flawed heroes demand a different potion, one that mixes the grit of reality with the seeds of excitement until they reach a critical mass and explode. In that sense, for all its strengths and good intentions, The Debt owes a debt to the wrong genre – Birkenau wasn't fantasy; too often, this movie is. "
1918,ed-wood-movie,Gene Siskel,100,"One of those rare films that communicates the exquisite joy of the moviemaking process. [7 October 1994, Friday, p.B]"
1919,big-star-nothing-can-hurt-me-movie,Farran Smith Nehme,38,"Big Star’s fans are so passionate that this film may well please some of them, but as for myself, I already knew their music was genius. By the end, I was muttering at every critic and musician and record producer, “Guys, tell me something I don’t know.”"
1920,the-raven-movie,Ty Burr,38,"A grimly preposterous serial-killer thriller set in 19th-century Baltimore, this riff on the final days of the author of ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" and other masterpieces of the macabre might qualify as literary desecration if it weren't so silly."
1921,novitiate-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"By avoiding the temptation to rail against religion and instead offer an introspective and respectful look at it, Novitiate becomes that rare thing: a movie willing to show the flaws of Catholicism without dwelling on its negatives."
1922,the-warrior-movie,Jan Stuart,80,"It is chockablock with brutality, but the violence is of the high-minded, self-congratulatory sort that indicates without actually showing."
1923,logan-lucky-movie,A.O. Scott,100,"Logan Lucky is a terrific movie. That’s a matter of skill, and maybe also of luck. But mostly it’s a matter of generosity."
1924,vhs2-movie,Rex Reed,0,"V/H/S/2 is a diabolically psychotic, sub-mental and completely unwatchable disaster that I happily deserted when a man with a retinal implant scooped out his bionic eye with a sharp object, splattering blood all over the camera. Your move, and you’re welcome to it."
1925,jacobs-ladder-movie,William Arnold,91,"Jacob's Ladder is also undeniably spooky. It creates and maintains a mood of paranoia, its special visual effects are original and nightmarish, and it has at least three sequences as haunting as anything I've seen in some time. [2 Nov 1990, p.9]"
1926,one-last-kiss-movie,Michael Atkinson,30,"The director knows how to apply textural gloss, but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom."
1927,under-the-skin-movie,Noel Murray,90,"The extraordinary achievement of Under The Skin is that while Laura develops some human qualities, Glazer resists the temptation to turn this alien’s story into the story of what it means to be human."
1928,into-the-arms-of-strangers-stories-of-the-kindertransport-movie,Emanuel Levy,80,Heartbreaking yet truly inspirational.

1930,the-hangover-part-ii-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"It delivers what it's expected to deliver, and that's likely to make it a success with anyone who laughed his ass off two summers ago. "
1931,leviathan-2014-movie,Leslie Felperin,100,"Simultaneously a modern essay on suffering, an open-ended thriller, and a black social comedy, it is most importantly of all a thinly-veiled political parable drenched in bitter irony that takes aim against the corrupt, corrosive regime of Vladimir Putin."
1932,night-comes-on-movie,Teo Bugbee,80,"The actress Jordana Spiro directed Night Comes On and wrote the script with Angelica Nwandu, a spoken-word poet and creator of the incisive gossip website The Shade Room. Ms. Nwandu is also a former client of the foster care system. The result of their partnership is a film that balances penetrating clarity with compassion."
1933,doctor-strange-movie,Rex Reed,25,"People who ask nothing more for their money than a lot of nerve-scrambling computerized special effects might get through Doctor Strange, another in a long line of lengthy, stupid and unbearable Marvel Studios comic books on film, with minimal brain damage."
1934,tiger-eyes-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"A gentle, honest and shrewdly realized film such as Tiger Eyes, based on the 1981 Judy Blume novel, shouldn't have to fight for a moviegoer's attention or an exhibitor's screens. But it's worth seeking out."
1935,september-dawn-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,33,A ham-fisted cautionary tale of religious fanaticism that would have been hooted out of even 19th-century theaters as melodrama of the most lurid kind.
1936,you-dont-mess-with-the-zohan-movie,Wesley Morris,75,"Nothing has brought me more cheap pleasure at a movie this year than the sight of shampoo and conditioner bottles falling off a rocking wall while comedian Alec Mapa, as a fellow stylist, tries to keep a straight face. He does a much better job than I did."
1937,about-schmidt-movie,Rene Rodriguez,100,"Ever the satirist, Payne mines humor from his characters, be it Randall's cockeyed pyramid-scheme ideas or the banality of a ridiculous wedding toast."
1938,introducing-the-dwights-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,67,"Blethyn's performance belongs in another movie, not this bipolar comedy-drama."
1939,southside-with-you-movie,Kenji Fujishima,63,"The film may not announce itself as hagiography, but it’s hero-worshipful to its core."
1940,knockaround-guys-movie,Loren King,38,"There's nothing original about the father-son conflict that forms the core of the film, nor is there enough suspense and drama."
1941,the-wisdom-of-crocodiles-movie,Derek Elley,30,Starts intriguingly but ends up thrashing around as a toothless wonder.
1942,logan-2017-movie,Brian Truitt,88,"Easily the best Wolverine outing, Logan is The Dark Knight of the mutant-filled X-franchise, a gripping film that transcends the comic-book genre by saying something important — and for Logan, that means coming to grips with needing loved ones in his life."
1943,the-haunting-in-connecticut-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,30,"Gives you the creeps, the giggles and the groans in almost equal measure."
1944,i-now-pronounce-you-chuck-larry-movie,Peter Rainer,0,Comedy that seems designed to be as bad as it can be.
1945,urban-legends-final-cut-movie,Desson Thomson,10,The only quandary in this film is in where to begin despising it.
1946,in-the-blood-movie,John Semley,75,"It’s overlong, overplotted and crowded with a cast of “hey-it’s-that-guy!” C-listers (Luis Guzman, Danny Trejo), but the closed-quarters combat crackles with bone-shattering believability. And that’s really all that matters."
1947,welcome-to-me-movie,Betsy Sharkey,70,"Though some of the jabs ""Me"" takes at reality TV are clever, the film, like Alice, tends to fracture at key moments. What makes it worth watching is Wiig."
1948,to-the-arctic-3d-movie,Sheri Linden,70,Meryl Streep narrates a heartwarming documentary for an up close look at Arctic wildlife.
1949,norbit-movie,Sean Axmaker,0,It's recidivist Murphy: bad-skit comedy populated by caricatures in search of a movie.
1950,everest-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,63,"Everest gets several things right, but it fails to find a way to make the average viewer relate to the people on the mountain."
1951,mother-and-child-movie,Michelle Orange,70,"Garcia, despite creating yet another vibrant canvas for his actors, deflects the burden of this toughest and most modern of familial conundrums, offering instead the bland, regressive ideal of motherhood as not only redemptive but required."
1952,the-boxtrolls-movie,Marc Savlov,20,The Boxtrolls feels rough-and-tumble and not as much fun by half.
1953,because-i-said-so-movie,Claudia Puig,25,"It's so derivative, unfunny and thuddingly bad that it's one of the more cringe-inducing movies of a genre chock-full of clunkers."
1954,swept-away-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"A deserted island movie during which I desperately wished the characters had chosen one movie to take along if they were stranded on a deserted island, and were showing it to us instead of this one."
1955,basic-movie,Robert Wilonsky,0,"Basic really brings to mind a Travolta film from 2000, ""Battlefield Earth,"" in that it's so astonishingly awful it becomes a sort of kinky pleasure; just when you think Travolta has fallen to the bottom of the barrel, he pulls out a shovel and dons his miner's helmet to see what lies beneath. "
1956,the-next-three-days-movie,James Berardinelli,75,Offers enough suspense to make it worth the price of admission. 
1957,twelve-years-a-slave-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,100,"The acting is outstanding, the direction assured if straightforward. 12 Years a Slave is a history lesson of the best type. It’s brilliant. But, more crucially, it’s important. It’s brutal truth that demands to be seen."
1958,contraband-movie,Alison Willmore,70,"It's still an obligingly tense, scruffy addition to the one-last-crime genre."
1959,knockaround-guys-movie,Megan Lehmann,38,"Any one episode of ""The Sopranos"" would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes."
1960,restrepo-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"The film is unusually free of cant and the usual trappings of war docs. There is no voice-over narration and very little dramatic underscoring. Right or wrong, the filmmakers shave matters of political policy and contextual analysis clean off the finished product, which runs a tight 94 minutes."
1961,summer-catch-movie,Peter Travers,10,Filming this mess in North Carolina (strike three).
1962,the-taking-of-pelham-1-2-3-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,20,Disposable crap.
1963,the-promise-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,70,"Chen Kaige clearly intended this Chinese fantasy-action spectacle to top Zhang Yimou's ""Hero,"" and I must admit that I prefer it to the earlier movie: the digital effects are sometimes excessive, yet Chen's story of a loyal slave, his master, and a wealthy, seemingly doomed princess is more affecting, especially in the closing stretch."
1964,harts-war-movie,Jay Carr,75,"Reminds us that the human dynamic can do a lot that explosions can't, even when the film flirts with formula."
1965,felix-and-meira-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"Tender, heartfelt and exquisitely dull, the drama Félix and Meira illustrates the perils of trying to tell an emotional love story with meaningful stares and long pauses."
1966,universal-soldier-the-return-movie,Sean Means,10,"Slow-moving and violent mess...feels slow even at a scant 82 minutes...Even by the slack standards of Van Damme's oeuvre, ""The Return""  is a letdown."
1967,the-interview-movie,Roger Moore,63,"Randall Park’s interpretation of Kim is dark, and darkly funny, a delusional turn with wincing, believable bits of psychoanalysis."
1968,moonlight-2016-movie,Robbie Collin,100,"Moonlight, the new film from Barry Jenkins, is a nuclear-fission-strength heartbreaker. It’s made up of moments so slight and incidental they’re sub-molecular – but they release enough heat and light to swallow whole cities at a stroke. "
1969,tucker-dale-vs-evil-movie,Dennis Harvey,70,"Sorta doing for ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""-type slashers what ""Shaun of the Dead"" did for zombie pics, ""T&D"" offers good-natured, confidently executed splatstick whose frequent hilarity suffers only from peaking too early."
1970,since-otar-left-movie,Wesley Morris,88,"What an amazing presence Gorintin has. Never mind her hunched back and white hair, she's no crone. She makes Eka needy for happiness but susceptible to heartbreak. It's a great performance, full of both joy and the quiet, disappointing parts of being alive that come with knowing change is part of life."
1971,rollerball-movie,Chris Gore,10,Will surely end up as one of this year’s worst films.
1972,crossroads-movie,John Anderson,20,"Spears acquits herself as well as anyone might, in a movie as contrived and lazy as this one."
1973,bandits-1999-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,Unruly girls around the world are liable to find these Bandits stealing their hearts.
1974,gosford-park-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"It's the style of the thing, not the plot, that is the attraction here, the great way the cast has with the snarky dialogue."
1975,son-of-the-bride-movie,Kim Morgan,75,"A movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you don't want to be. It's a gushy, sometimes-maudlin, often-charming movie that highlights the importance of little things."
1976,smashed-movie,James White,80,"The sharp ends in Smashed are here for all to see, and Ponsoldt never shies away from their spiky, thought-provoking effect. Yet he also finds grace and warmth in the story. "
1977,fish-tank-movie,Peter Travers,88,"While you're remembering new high-impact names, add Arnold. In only her second film, after 2006's ""Red Road,"" she keeps the screen filled to bursting with the beauty and raw terror of life."
1978,analyze-this-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"Ramis has made a fleet, unself-conscious, eminently enjoyable picture, where one-liners carom merrily like stray bullets, and where there's casual ease, like the drape of a sharpster's trousers, in the rapport between its two stars."
1979,control-2005-movie,Marrit Ingman,89,"Though the story is thinly conceived, Antal throws a fantastic curveball in the second act. Kontroll is a hot ticket."
1980,blue-in-the-face-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"The film is so exuberant that we don't care whether we're listening to Lou Reed's off-the-cuff comments about New York, watching Mel Gorham do a sexy dance in front of a mirror, or hearing Jim Jarmusch's ramblings on the romance of the smoking culture."
1981,snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"The word genius is easily used and has been cheapened, but when it is used to describe Walt Disney, reflect that he conceived of this film, in all of its length, revolutionary style and invention, when there was no other like it--and that to one degree or another, every animated feature made since owes it something."
1982,captain-america-the-winter-soldier-movie,Lawrence Toppman,83,"This sequel is, by design, entirely absorbing and satisfying without being one whit memorable."
1983,ghosts-of-mars-movie,Barry Johnson,25,"It's not confusing, it's just slow. Very slow. Glacial."
1984,ghost-movie,Jay Scott,88,"It's an unpredictable, mesmerizing journey nearly every shady second of the way."
1985,driven-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,25,What we have here is a film where the first 20 minutes are repeated again and again until everything comes to an absolutely predictable end.
1986,the-honeymooners-movie,Mike Clark,25,"A pitiful update that saddles poor Cedric the Entertainer with the unenviable task of taking over Jackie Gleason's premier creation, Ralph Kramden."
1987,the-yards-movie,Shawn Levy,75,"A work of incompleteness, might-have-beens and moral subtleties befitting a filmmaker named Gray."
1988,why-stop-now-movie,Simon Abrams,0,"An unbearable 90-minute trip with a trio of loud, needy egotists."
1989,the-end-of-the-affair-movie,Jami Bernard,63,"Many of the right elements -- the '40s look, the melodrama, the love that transcends reason."
1990,lost-in-translation-movie,Carrie Rickey,100,This year's must-see film.
1991,a-long-way-down-movie,Leslie Felperin,20,"The film forms a near-perfect storm of misjudged decisions, with its implausible plot, irritating or outright-dislikeable characters, and strained attempts at “wacky” British humor that fall so flat they’re below sea level."
1992,oceans-thirteen-movie,Chris Hewitt (1),80,"You can beat the house and you can break the bank, but sequels always get long odds on defeating the law of diminishing returns – yet Ocean's Thirteen just about pulls it off."
1993,lauberge-espagnole-movie,Steven Rea,88,A love song to the new Europe (Klapisch's original title: Euro Pudding) and a snapshot of a polyglot gang on the cusp of kind-of-reckless youth and responsibility-burdened adulthood.
1994,color-me-kubrick-movie,Nathan Lee,30,"I find it hard to believe that Conway bamboozled half of London simply by announcing his name, and it's regrettable that the filmmakers premise their picture on such improbable gullibility. The real Conway was assuredly slier than his bio-pic incarnation; he ought to have been played by Sacha Baron Cohen."
1995,the-longest-yard-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"""The Waterboy"" was funny because Sandler doesn't look like a football player. When he swaggers around The Longest Yard starting fights and taking beatings without flinching, he only reminds us how little Steve McQueen and how much Woody Allen there is in him."
1996,ant-man-and-the-wasp-movie,Simon Abrams,75,"Taken in its entirety, Ant-Man and the Wasp may not be the best anything, but, like its perpetually challenged hero, it is plenty good enough."
1997,the-mexican-movie,David Ansen,20,"A tired, confused romantic comedy/noir thriller with all the suspense of an infomercial. Buy the poster; skip the movie."
1998,about-last-night-movie,Jenni Miller,70,"It’s funnier than it has any right to be, really. "
1999,only-god-forgives-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"The movie contains little in terms of traditional action, and Refn never uses it in a rousing or exciting manner, either. That would break the nightmarish spell this strange, beautiful film casts on the viewer. A mother’s love has never been this ruinous."
2000,formula-51-movie,Marc Mohan,8,"As sometimes occurs in unsupervised experiments, the result proves foul-smelling and potentially toxic."
2001,finding-nemo-movie,Peter Rainer,100,It has what the most heartfelt Disney animated features used to have: rapturous imagery matched with real wit.
2002,the-giver-movie,Drew McWeeny,25,"There are some actual big ideas bubbling around somewhere below the surface of the film, but it's so ham-handed, so unable to grapple with the full implications of any of those ideas, that it actually becomes offensive."
2003,light-it-up-movie,Michael Atkinson,23,A shovelful of silly manure from the get-go.
2004,the-last-song-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"It's the worst of both worlds as Disney cash cow Miley Cyrus makes the most dubious ""dramatic"" debut of any singer since Britney Spears."
2005,sleeping-with-other-people-movie,Kimberley Jones,78,It’s a shrewd last move in a movie that’s uncommonly smart about when to buck convention and when to conform to the warm feels we all want.
2006,skate-kitchen-movie,Marc Savlov,67,"Skate Kitchen’s mild melodrama meanders all over the place, not unlike the many skateboarders who shred the skate parks and streets, carving hypnotic, slo-mo figure-eights or outrageous triple ollies on every available surface and obstacle. "
2007,mental-movie,Tina Hassannia,12,"Given the film's garrulous multitude of characters, one wishes they would all just shut up and sing."
2008,abandon-movie,Ty Burr,38,"Abandon is this CLOSE to being good, juicy, bad-movie fun."
2009,blood-diamond-movie,Glenn Kenny,88,"Not that Diamond skimps on the social commentary; far from it. But it makes its points without too much breast-beating, caching its polemic within a tough-minded entertainment."
2010,circuit-movie,V.A. Musetto,25,Dirk Shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting. But it does have oodles of hunky male bodies. The choice is yours.
2011,pain-gain-movie,Peter Travers,12,"In between scenes of the muscleheads torturing their victim, Bay indulges his taste for treating women as sluts and grisly brutality as a nifty excuse for a cheap laugh. Pain and Gain is personal all right. You leave these characters with the distinct impression that they're Bay's kind of people."
2012,whale-rider-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"A substantial film of unexpected emotional force. And when at a certain point it seems to slip the bonds of this world and take a leap of faith into an almost mythological dimension, it breathlessly takes us along for that memorable ride."
2013,keanu-movie,Devan Coggan,67,"Even if it can’t compete with the best highlights from their TV show, Keanu is a solid first step into movie stardom for both Key and Peele. "
2014,cocktail-movie,Jay Scott,0,"There is no reality here, and no style: Cocktail waters down the philosophy of Dr. Norman Vincent Peale and serves it in a shot glass to hustlers. High school hustlers. [29 Jul 1988, p.C11]"
2015,sweet-november-movie,Peter Travers,20,"Beware all male viewers who enter here, you are in chick-movie hell."
2016,seraphim-falls-movie,Josh Rosenblatt,67,"With Seraphim Falls, Brosnan shows himself, finally, to be an actor of real skill – rather than just a pretty face, a great head of hair, and a buttery British accent – capable not only of playing a real human being but one with a tortured soul and a dodgy past as well."
2017,cyrano-de-bergerac-movie,Judy Stone,100,"It is ensemble work of the highest quality, but it is Depardieu's graceful and illuminating performance that is unforgettable. [19 Dec 1990, p.E1]"
2018,divine-secrets-of-the-ya-ya-sisterhood-movie,David Sterritt,25,"Khouri's new picture takes all this talent and turns it into the kind of manipulative mush that Hollywood used to market under the condescending label ""woman's picture"" years ago."
2019,windtalkers-movie,Michael Sragow,63,"Woo's antiwar intentions and his talent are at odds. In Windtalkers, war is a beautiful hell."
2020,badlands-movie,Josh Larsen,88,"This is largely another of Malick’s impressionistic tales of paradise lost, but here the dreamy approach feels fresh and exciting. "
2021,the-last-castle-movie,Jonathan Foreman,88,"It's an even rarer pleasure to see a film that combines exciting action with a smart, well-informed script and vivid yet restrained performances."
2022,sorority-boys-movie,Ellen A. Kim,25,"Somebody in Hollywood thought taking ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""Animal House,"" sticking them in a blender and serving in Dixie cups was a good idea. That somebody should be fired."
2023,best-night-ever-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,0,"Likely to be appreciated only by homeless viewers who need a quiet place to nap during the cold months of winter, the movie has more awkward dead space than jokes."
2024,berlin-syndrome-movie,Bryan Bishop,80,"Palmer’s performance is honest and brave (particularly given that she’s often just performing scenes alone), and Shortland deftly switches between locked-door thriller mode and more nuanced character work."
2025,are-we-there-yet-movie,Claudia Puig,38,Not worth the ride.
2026,her-alibi-movie,Vincent Canby,0,A romantic melodrama of a boringness to make your average tooth extraction seem preferable.
2027,running-with-scissors-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"Ms. Bening's precise, pitiless tracing of her character's decline from feisty defiance to pathetic, overmedicated self-delusion gives the film an emotional weight it might not otherwise have."
2028,tropic-thunder-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"If you go see Tropic Thunder this weekend, don't be late. The four fake ads that open the movie are perhaps the apex of its considerable comic invention."
2029,hell-ride-movie,William Arnold,16,"Terrible in a terrible way: It's pretentious, incomprehensible and just numbingly dull."
2030,corky-romano-movie,Robert Wilonsky,0,"Simply, the worst movie of a wretched year."
2031,equity-movie,Kerry Lengel,70,"If there is a criticism to be made, it’s that Equity is just a bit too low-key to fully draw the audience in. The chiaroscuro lighting and thrumming mood music build tension slowly and surely, but never enough to make you inch forward in your seat. Just a smidgen of Gordon Gekko bombast might kick things up a notch."
2032,things-to-come-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,88,"At its satirical best, Things to Come takes aim at some of the sacred cows of French academia, showing how the posturing of today’s radical kids seems to repeat the attitudes their parents had in the '60s."
2033,the-great-train-robbery-movie,Staff (Not Credited),70,"Crichton’s films drag in dialog bouts, but triumph when action takes over."
2034,terror-firmer-movie,Maitland McDonagh,0,Is there anything more irritating than an exploitation filmmaker with self-referentiality on the brain?
2035,filth-and-wisdom-movie,Liam Lacey,25,"Reportedly, the movie began life as a short film, and if it actually ran for 22 minutes with a few commercial breaks, like a good sitcom should, Filth and Wisdom could be bearable. At 84 minutes, the movie feels both overpadded and underdeveloped."
2036,high-fidelity-movie,Marc Caro,75,Easily cracks the top five list of reasons to go to the movies these days - and defies categories in doing so.
2037,billy-elliot-movie,David Sterritt,75,"Trumpets the worthwhile message that ballet is just as manly and athletic as any other masculine activity - and maybe a touch more so, if you have to defy an uncomprehending community in order to pursue it."
2038,footloose-movie,Steven Rea,63,"As remakes go, Footloose is fine, serving up slightly fresher batches of cheese and corn. But why? Why?"
2039,the-generals-daughter-movie,Wesley Morris,25,"A slick, supercharged popcorn flick of the erstwhile Bruckheimer-Simpson brigade in which the only thing more shameful than the proceedings is a very well-paid male star assigned to make you less aware of that sucking sound."
2040,buffalo-66-movie,James Berardinelli,75,Gallo's script is quirky and filled with a number of hilariously strange comic moments.
2041,death-of-a-nation-movie,Josh Kupecki,11,"This is filmmaking as polemic, and much in the same way as Michael Moore’s (much better) films have a particular agenda to puzzle out various ways in which our country has failed us, this traffics in the same vein."
2042,last-chance-harvey-movie,James Berardinelli,75,Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson bring credibility to Last Chance Harvey merely by their presence. The result is a holiday parfait.
2043,shadow-of-the-vampire-movie,Shawn Levy,67,Built on an absolutely marvelous idea but manages to make only about two-thirds of a good movie of it.
2044,tyler-perrys-a-madea-christmas-movie,Sean O’Connell,25,"An insensitive, unfunny cringer from the entrepreneurial writer-director that should have come with a gift receipt."
2045,the-reach-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"The ludicrous action thriller Beyond the Reach fails to achieve the Southwestern noir potency of “No Country for Old Men,” but there’s no denying it brings to mind another Southwestern classic about malicious pursuit: the Road Runner cartoons."
2046,200-cigarettes-movie,Todd McCarthy,10,"Dismally unfunny...It's clear from the first few minutes that the performers are fighting an uphill battle against lame material, and the situation never improves as pic labors on."
2047,escape-from-planet-earth-movie,Louis Black,0,This movie is a mess: It keeps doubling back on itself – a twisting pretzel of a plot that doesn’t really make sense.
2048,the-woodsman-movie,Steven Rea,75,Bacon's portrait chills to the bone.
2049,zathura-a-space-adventure-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,83,Cool!
2050,the-second-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-movie,Peter Debruge,70,"It’s not so common to find an ensemble of this caliber so enthusiastic to work together, and that chemistry comes across."
2051,mean-girls-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,75,A vinegary fable with a Splenda aftertaste -- is a harbinger of hope not only for future feminist comedies of any grit but also for ''SNL''-staffed feature films that don't disproportionately suck.
2052,windtalkers-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"It's the best new battle film since ""Black Hawk Down,"" a movie it surpasses in sheer feeling and bravura style, if not in nightmarish panic and suspense."
2053,the-boss-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,38,Throughout its last hour it keeps jumping into your lap and demanding love without doing anything to earn it. 
2054,velvet-goldmine-movie,Elvis Mitchell,90,"Brilliantly reimagines the glam-rock 70's as a brave new world of electrifying theatricality and sexual possibility, to the point where identifying precise figures in this neo-psychedelic landscape is almost beside the point."
2055,mollys-game-movie,Chris Nashawaty,91,"Molly’s Game is a cool, crackling, confident film that appeals to your intelligence instead of insulting it. At the movies, it may be the closest we’ll get to a Christmas miracle."
2056,baby-geniuses-movie,Michael Sauter,0,The worst movie of 1999.
2057,kick-ass-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"It may well be a hit, but me, I'm waiting for  ""Iron Man 2."""
2058,testament-of-youth-movie,Inkoo Kang,80,"The men are slightly forgettable, but the woman is not. Far from the flawless fembot in “Ex Machina,” Vikander’s slight gawkiness is highlighted here, allowing her to look like a real girl, absolutely the right decision by Kent."
2059,star-wars-episode-vi---return-of-the-jedi-movie,Gene Siskel,100,"But with 'Jedi,' listen to the creaking, huge metal door that opens and leads the androids C-3PO and R2-D2 to the cave of Jabba the Hutt, where, at the beginning of the film, good-guy space pilot Han Solo is frozen in a carbonite mold like some kind of nouvelle cuisine side dish. It will remind old-time radio listeners of the creaking door of the 'Inner Sanctum' show, and it serves the same purpose. Both are doorways to adventure...And before this portion of the 'Star Wars' saga is history, let us take time to praise the principal performers."
2060,taking-lives-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,"Nosedive it does, abandoning all pretense of style and eccentricity for at-times laughable predictability and a parade of unconvincing red herrings straight out of Murder Mystery 101."
2061,soul-man-movie,Dave Kehr,25,"Soul Man is a slick, frightening piece of work.  It's not onlybecause Ron Reagan Jr. has a bit part in it that it seems the definitiveReagan-era film."
2062,bad-moms-christmas-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Nothing like celebrating the holidays with a puerile, sentimental and foul-mouthed slapstick farce for kids masquerading as “adult” entertainment."
2063,il-divo-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,"All in all, this phenomenal film illustrates Alexis de Tocqueville's observation that ""The people get the government they deserve."" In both meanings of the word, Il Divo is sensational."
2064,untitled-taken-sequel-movie,Alison Willmore,30,Taken 2 grabs everything that was surprisingly enjoyable about the original film and batters it into the ground.
2065,summer-catch-movie,Paula Nechak,25,"Tries mightily to have the charm of ""Bull Durham,"" but instead fields raunchy sex jokes, predictable story line, dumb dialogue and a lackluster love affair."
2066,spider-man-2-movie,Ella Taylor,80,"Molina is an actor of unusually elastic gifts, but unlike Willem Dafoe, who has only to bare his scary teeth to send us all scampering for the exits, there's no getting around the fact that Molina has the face of a kindly basset hound even when it's contorted into a deadly grimace."
2067,the-forger-movie,David Rooney,30,"While director Martin keeps the film moving, its implausibilities turn from holes into canyons."
2068,lazer-team-movie,Matt Fagerholm,12,"This movie is, in essence, a product of fame and money without the slightest tangible shred of effort. "
2069,the-ladykillers-movie,Maitland McDonagh,30,"A leaden, tone-deaf remake of the 1955 Ealing comedy starring Alec Guinness, the Coen brothers' painfully unfunny rehash hinges on the duel of wits between five larcenous oddballs and one sweet but strong-willed old lady. "
2070,the-human-centipede-ii-full-sequence-movie,Todd Gilchrist,10,"Nasty and over the top, The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) feels like a horror movie that hates horror fans."
2071,the-lazarus-effect-movie,Geoff Berkshire,30,“Lazarus” shamelessly steals from superior genre efforts and lacks any distinguishing traits beyond a wildly overqualified cast.
2072,stage-beauty-movie,Liam Lacey,63,"At best, the film makes a more convincing case for the adventure of artificiality: Take Billy Crudup, add a little rouge to his cheeks and suddenly: Voilà, the guy can act."
2073,duane-hopwood-movie,Michael Wilmington,63,"Thanks to the actors and the way the movie lets them loose, it's often funny or moving at all the right moments."
2074,the-unknown-known-movie,Godfrey Cheshire,88,Amounts to a valuable if tremendously damning commentary on our current political culture. 
2075,godzilla-1998-movie,Chris Gore,30,"For the single-digit age set, Godzilla is sure to be the greatest movie of all time."
2076,samson-movie,Roger Moore,38,"It’s a visually and dramatically flat picture in which the co-directors just check off the touchstones in Samson’s storied career, lurching forward, parking him in reasonably rustic settings with tunics and smocks and sometimes shirtless. There’s little character arc, and even less story arc."
2077,raising-helen-movie,Michael Sragow,38,"By the end, this movie's balancing act is the equivalent of network news' equal-time laws. The ""fairness"" becomes deadening."
2078,the-men-who-stare-at-goats-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,30,"There's no doubt we need more movies for grown-ups, with jokes that don't hit us over the head, but The Men Who Stare at Goats doesn't fit the bill. At best, it might hypnotize you into a stupor."
2079,before-midnight-movie,Richard Roeper,88,"A rich, smart, funny, sometimes acidic portrayal of a couple who can be spectacular when they’re in tune — and toxic when they’re at each other’s throats."
2080,outbreak-movie,Rick Groen,38,"After a great start, Wolfgang Petersen's intelligent medical thriller is infected by some nasty germs, resulting in the all-too-common Actionitis.  [10 Mar 1995]"
2081,step-brothers-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"Ferrell and Reilly get more mileage out of juvenile pouting and bickering than any other performers I can imagine, but that's about as far as this goes."
2082,the-two-jakes-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"It's an exquisite short story about a mood, and a time, and a couple of guys who are blind-sided by love."
2083,twins-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"Twins is not a great comedy - it's not up there with Reitman's ""Ghostbusters"" and DeVito is not as funny as he was in ""Ruthless People"" and ""Wise Guys"" - but it is an engaging entertainment with some big laughs and a sort of warm goofiness."
2084,outside-in-movie,Chris Nashawaty,83,"Shelton may not be as prolific as the Duplasses (I’m not sure anyone could be – they seem to churn out movies in their sleep), but her work has steadily gotten more assured and quietly powerful. Her continued partnership with the brothers is a tonic for anyone who cares about keeping the Sundance-of-the-‘90s spirit alive."
2085,a-haunted-house-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,"By eliminating the winking, broad strokes of the filmmakers' more successful spoofs, they've made a film that is not only dumb, but dull. It's like watching a snuff film, only it's the audience who's dying inside."
2086,black-mass-movie,Richard Roeper,75,"This is a good, solid, well-executed crime story. Nothing more, nothing less."
2087,the-chronicles-of-narnia-the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-movie,Rick Groen,100,"The picture goes exactly where the prose does, enticing all of us, kids and adults and atheists and believers alike, down below the brittle surface of our cold logic and into a richer world of imaginative wonder."
2088,left-behind-2014-movie,Michael Ordona,25,"That lack of concern for the way people actually interact renders the film useless as entertainment, or as a conversion tool."
2089,death-of-a-nation-movie,Vadim Rizov,0,"D’Souza fails, as ever, to make an argument that would resonate outside the QAnon echo chamber. "
2090,afternoon-delight-movie,Tomas Hachard,12,Jill Soloway's film is dishonest in the way it attempts to mask self-pity as enlightened self-criticism.
2091,song-to-song-movie,Carson Lund,88,"The film is about floating along on currents of uncertain desire and excitement, overthinking your own indulgence in these whims, and then sometime later on down the road, through no clear constellation of reasons, recognizing that a real human connection was squandered in the haze of all that self-exploration."
2092,splice-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"Splice is an unholy mess because it fuses together the worst parts of every bad medical-monster thriller, and then boldly cranks up the ridiculous."
2093,adventureland-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"The result is a sharp, insightful, charming motion picture."
2094,the-transporter-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"There's plenty to like here, especially for connoisseurs of the action genre, and there's also plenty to make you wonder whether Besson and co-writer Robert Mark Kamen scribbled their screenplay on a batch of Marseilles cocktail napkins and then lost one or two."
2095,slow-west-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,90,"Its central journey lives up to the title: Maclean finds time to savor rivers and starscapes and layers of light and mountainous land. The dialogue is flighty yet weighty, each line like some delicate woodcut."
2096,the-age-of-innocence-movie,Rick Groen,100,"It comes eerily close to duplicating the experience of reading while, at the same time, remaining very much a motion picture. That's a rare, perhaps even unprecedented, achievement."
2097,the-raid-redemption-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,"The mousetrap setup and tight fight spaces, the bad blood and cruel deaths - soon makes the movie grindingly monotonous, a blur of thudding body blows. "
2098,john-dies-at-the-end-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"A supernatural horror-comedy that's frighteningly lacking in wit, John Dies at the End thinks it's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" for dudes. But in its randomness, its vulgarity and its level of humor, it's more like the collected writings on the walls of a roadside men's room."
2099,birthday-girl-movie,Lisa Alspector,20,"The most subtly revolting aspect of the movie is how it manages to exploit violence for cheap thrills, in part by equating submission with love."
2100,blame-it-on-rio-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"Blame It On Rio has the mind of a 1940s bongo comedy and the heart of a porno film. It's really unsettling to see how casually this movie takes a serious situation. A disturbed girl is using sex to play mind games with a middle-aged man, and the movie get its yuks with slapstick scenes where one guy goes out the window when the other guy comes in the door. What's shocking is how many first-rate talents are associated with this sleaze. "
2101,the-hottest-state-movie,Scott Brown,0,"Whatever you're imagining -- self-serving self-awareness; unedited hipster mopes; yammering dear-diary script -- The Hottest State, Ethan Hawke's bathetic tale of a good-looking young actor's first heartbreak, is far worse."
2102,a-sound-of-thunder-movie,Tasha Robinson,20,"A plodding, bloated, long-shelved adaptation/expansion of Ray Bradbury's classic short story about the dangers of time travel."
2103,death-sentence-movie,Joshua Katzman,30,This graphically violent film suffers from cursorily developed characters whose primary function is to advance the creaky plot.
2104,the-peacemaker-movie,Charles Taylor,20,Punishingly dull.
2105,brokeback-mountain-movie,Ann Hornaday,70,"Brokeback Mountain possesses handsome and sympathetic lead players, magnificent scenery, heartbreaking melodrama, righteousness and cultural import. But as a testament to the importance of following one's passion, it's devoid of one crucial thing: passion."
2106,getaway-movie,Drew Taylor,0,"It's understandable that larger scale movies will want to spawn sequels, but this is about two degrees away from being a movie that premieres on Cinemax on a Friday night, sandwiched between two soft core porn movies with funny titles. Getaway is stuck in neutral. And that's where it'll stay."
2107,serving-sara-movie,Scott Tobias,10,Misbegotten late-summer special.
2108,muscle-shoals-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,67,"Although the intriguingly named first-time director Greg “Freddy” Camalier makes the twice-told tales of the film’s second hour watchable, they end up paling in comparison to its essayistic first half."
2109,the-princess-diaries-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,20,"Such weak medicine. Sure enough, it goes down. Keeping it down is another matter."
2110,central-station-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"The movie's success rests largely on the shoulders of Fernanda Montenegro, an actress who successfully defeats any temptation to allow sentimentality to wreck her relationship with the child."
2111,alex-emma-movie,Laura Sinagra,10,This isn't one for the time capsule--just bury it. 
2112,wont-you-be-my-neighbor-movie,Noel Murray,91,"The film’s real strength is its plainness. Won’t You Be My Neighbor?, like Rogers, tells us what we already know in our bones about how we’re supposed to behave. Hearing it said aloud, so calmly, is unexpectedly shattering."
2113,sicko-movie,Jack Mathews,88,"Moore's most assured, least antagonistic and potentially most important film."
2114,duplex-movie,Philip Wuntch,33,"Unfunny and misguided, Duplex deserves a wrecking crew. "
2115,rape-me-movie,Marc Savlov,0,It's pornography of the most depressing sort.
2116,movie-43-movie,Joe Leydon,0,"An appalling misfire that tries and fails to evoke the anything-goes spirit of such '70s sketch-comedy concoctions as ""The Groove Tube"" and ""Kentucky Fried Movie."""
2117,listen-to-me-marlon-movie,Steve Davis,89,"No talking heads here, just Marlon in all his magnificent complexity. For any cineaste, it’s a mind-blowing experience."
2118,the-promise-movie,Rick Groen,75,"In keeping with that home-team tradition, The Promise lives up to the title --it really delivers the eye-popping goods."
2119,88minutes-movie,Todd McCarthy,10,"Ludicrous in the extreme, the picture easily snatches from ""Revolution"" the prize as Al Pacino's career worst."
2120,seoul-searching-movie,Nick Allen,75,"The episodic narrative of Seoul Searching can be too long and unfocused, but its stubbornness comes from filmmaking that is overflowing with self-pride."
2121,penguins-of-madagascar-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,75,"Frenetic and frequently funny, Penguins Of Madagascar represents the DreamWorks Animation franchise style — which boils down to self-aware, but naïve, talking animals who learn kid-friendly life lessons — at its most palatable. "
2122,the-taste-of-others-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"All of this romantic back and forth unfolds gradually and in charming ensemble style. As the characters think about seducing each other, as they inevitably complicate their lives without being able to help themselves, the film is simultaneously seducing us."
2123,winters-tale-movie,Robbie Collin,20,"The whole thing is so roaringly absurd, and delivered with such hands-clasped sincerity, that the only rational response is to laugh the house down."
2124,the-dark-tower-movie,April Wolfe,30,"Outside of its actors, the film is unremarkable."
2125,gettin-the-mans-foot-outta-your-baadasssss!-movie,Allison Benedikt,88,"Overall, Baadasssss! succeeds marvelously at evoking the passion and frantic energy behind ""Sweetback"" and putting it all in the context of its politically charged era."
2126,the-man-who-shot-liberty-valance-movie,Dave Kehr,100,"A great film, rich in thought and feeling, composed in rhythms that vary from the elegiac to the spontaneous. "
2127,room-237-movie,Marc Mohan,83,"The credibility of these theories ranges from faintly plausible to frankly ridiculous, but Ascher isn't interested in judging them; his movie is more about the joys of deconstruction and the special kind of obsession that movies can inspire. "
2128,domino-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,Domino is a new definition of a snuff movie. It snuffs out every vestige of feeling.
2129,lost-boys-of-sudan-movie,Karen Karbo,83,"In the rather weak ending, we aren't sure what will become of Peter and Santino."
2130,the-adventures-of-rocky-bullwinkle-movie,Peter Travers,30,"It's sledgehammer whimsy, and it's not talking to me."
2131,my-life-in-ruins-movie,Amy Binacolli,25,"A cliché movie about love, orneriness and several maddening tourists."
2132,venus-in-fur-movie,David Rooney,80,"There’s a masterfully light touch at work, both from the director and his two wonderful actors. They make this chamber piece lip-smacking entertainment, giving the dense text the semblance of more intellectual heft or sexual transgression than it ultimately contains."
2133,charlies-angels-full-throttle-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,"Two-hour exercise in chaotic action and coarse, annoyingly coy sexuality."
2134,scarface-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Scarface is one of those special movies, like ""The Godfather,"" that is willing to take a flawed, evil man and allow him to be human."
2135,dark-crimes-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,16,"Here, a few words should be said about Carrey’s performance: It may be the worst dramatic acting of his career, a charmless cartoon of self-repression."
2136,spirited-away-movie,Steven Rea,100,Wondrously strange and just plain wonderful.
2137,the-thin-red-line-movie,Scott Tobias,90,"Malick's powerful intermingling of brutality and beauty, his signature cutaways to indigenous flora and fauna, and the gentle lyricism of his disjunctive narration and painterly images are too rich to fully register in a single viewing."
2138,halloween-h20-20-years-later-movie,Rick Groen,25,"Steve Miner is no Carpenter. A directing veteran of the Friday the 13th saga (parts II and III, in case you care), he's a plodder who favours long, dull buildups to short, dull climaxes -- it's slaughter by the numbers."
2139,answers-to-nothing-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"A root canal seems a more pleasurable way to pass two hours than this interminable vanity knockoff of ""Traffic"" about troubled Angelenos."
2140,head-of-state-movie,Michael Sragow,63,"In Head of State, Rock may be verging on becoming a heart-warmer. "
2141,the-baader-meinhof-complex-movie,Steven Rea,75,"If Edel's Oscar-nominated film drags in its final 40 minutes, it's a function of the director's fidelity to the facts - and the fact that the founding trio (and the film's stars) have become prisoners of the state, confined and confused."
2142,nymphomaniac-volume-two-movie,Chuck Bowen,38,"The sex in Nymphomaniac is inhuman, mechanical, boring, and predictably viewed through the (male) scrim of someone who characterizes women solely as withholders."
2143,the-bridge-on-the-river-kwai-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,"It is a whale (2 hr. 41 min.) of a story, and in the telling of it, British Director David Lean (Brief Encounter, Great Expectations) does a whale of a job. He shows a dazzlingly musical sense and control of the many and involving rhythms of a vast composition. He shows a rare sense of humor and a feeling for the poetry of situation; and he shows the even rarer ability to express these things, not in lines but in lives. Most important of all, he understands the real nature of the story he is telling. "
2144,what-time-is-it-over-there-movie,Steven Winn,25,"Things happen in a flat, deadpan way."
2145,i-dreamed-of-africa-movie,Jean Oppenheimer,20,A wobbly Basinger and a feeble screenplay doom I Dreamed of Africa.
2146,12-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Mikhalkov has made a new film with its own original characters and stories, and after all, it's not how the film ends, but how it gets there."
2147,a-prophet-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"If his two previous films suggested a director dipping a few toes in dark waters, Un Prophete marks the moment when Audiard took the plunge."
2148,michael-jordan-to-the-max-movie,David Davis,30,"Ultimately, it's as vapid as (Michael Jordan's) perfume and as disposable as a pair of his Hanes."
2149,scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-movie,Richard Corliss,70,"The perfect summation of Hollywood at this moment - an apotheosis of American male infantilism - and, on its own, a most likable mess."
2150,the-animal-movie,Peter Travers,10,Reeks like something produced from a squatting position.
2151,tears-of-the-black-tiger-movie,Wesley Morris,88,"A parody of and winking homage to the history of Thai melodrama, Wisit Sasanatieng's uproarious filmmaking debut exuberantly combines pop and kitsch with a wholesome belief in the thrills of bad art."
2152,run-all-night-movie,Jeff Baker,75,"Harris, crinkly and laser-eyed, has enough gravity to hang with Neeson. Their scenes together anchor a movie that gets away from itself at times and relies on the tired family-in-jeopardy final act."
2153,primal-fear-movie,Peter Travers,12,"You'd get more of a jolt from Angela Lansbury on ""Murder, She Wrote"" and more intellectual stimulation from a cozy game of Clue."
2154,the-heart-is-deceitful-above-all-things-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"An almost comically lurid tale of a little boy abused by his malignant hooker mother, malignant fundamentalist grandfather, and malignant surrogate dads."
2155,being-elmo-a-puppeteers-journey-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,"Though one gets a sense there is part of the story Marks isn't telling, we do pay attention to the man behind the curtain."
2156,death-to-smoochy-movie,Hank Sartin,10,It's hard to pinpoint where things go wrong.
2157,the-mighty-ducks-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,30,The Mighty Ducks may satisfy the Pee Wee hockey players in your household but the rest of you may be turned off by the simplified penance and redemption formula.
2158,sex-and-the-city-2-movie,A.O. Scott,10,The ugly smell of unexamined privilege hangs over this film like the smoke from cheap incense.
2159,lost-found-movie,Stephen Holden,20,"A rancid little nothing of a movie that baldly recycles plot elements of ""There's Something About Mary."""
2160,me-before-you-movie,David Edelstein,30,"Clarke is so insistent on becoming the new adorkable life force that she’s excruciating to watch. The movie makes you admire all the more her restrained power in Game of Thrones, in which her eyebrows are largely stationary."
2161,the-heart-of-me-movie,Ann Hornaday,10,"Terribly tragic, terribly romantic and, ultimately, terribly, terribly dull."
2162,the-snowman-movie,Justin Chang,10,A wretched waste of time and talent.
2163,serving-sara-movie,Jean Oppenheimer,10,"Numbingly feeble --  The dialogue is witless, the situations are lame, the humor juvenile and the chemistry between the stars nonexistent."
2164,date-night-movie,Wade Major,0,A broadly promising premise and well-matched stars prove no match for an abominably unfunny screenplay and the work of the poisonously untalented Shawn Levy--arguably the worst director making big-budget studio films today.
2165,boat-trip-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"Not that the film is outrageous. That would be asking too much. It is dim-witted, unfunny, too shallow to be offensive."
2166,the-promise-movie,V.A. Musetto,12,The Promise employs laughable computer effects and second-rate martial-arts fighting to tell the hard-to-figure story of a princess and her three lovers.
2167,10-to-midnight-movie,Bill Cosford,0,"The final scene is so foul that even ya-hoos have trouble mustering much applause; it's the kind of film that makes you feel dirty. As for Bronson, whose box-office appeal has faded as the viciousness of his films has increased, Ten to Midnight is a kind of milestone: It's time to write him off. [22 Mar 1983, p.B5]"
2168,the-replacement-killers-movie,Manohla Dargis,0,Pure junk.
2169,the-expendables-3-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,Time to pull the plug on this brain-dead franchise.
2170,she-hate-me-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"Spike Lee carries his political exasperation beyond outrage into chaos. The carelessness with which he hurls his feelings about hot-button topics onto the screen is the filmmaking equivalent of last-ditch marketing: grab everything in sight, roll it up into a big messy mud ball, and hurl it against the wall, hoping that something sticks."
2171,all-about-steve-movie,Peter Travers,0,"Unwatchable, unbearably unfunny farce."
2172,the-legend-of-tarzan-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"The Legend of Tarzan, for all its anticolonialist posturing and eminently attractive co-stars, has a dead soul."
2173,cats-dogs-the-revenge-of-kitty-galore-movie,Scott Tobias,0,"And it's still, in the spirit of the original film, an unbelievable piece of sh--. "
2174,filth-and-wisdom-movie,Neely Tucker,10,The only thing this movie should lead you to is the nearest exit.
2175,88minutes-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,0,"A stinker, the more so for the thespian excesses of the accomplished cast."
