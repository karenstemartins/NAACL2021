0,mystic-river-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"A major American motion picture, an overpowering piece of work that involves some of the most basic human emotions: love, hate, fear, revenge, despair. Directed by Clint Eastwood with absolute confidence and remarkable control."
1,hollywood-ending-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,A beautifully shot film with a funny French-twist ending.
2,luther-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,An unholy mess. 
3,untraceable-movie,Carrie Rickey,38,An abhorrent cyberthriller starring a compelling Diane Lane.
4,here-comes-the-boom-movie,Nathan Rabin,33,"Here Comes The Boom seems to have made it from the pitch stage - Kevin James does MMA to save his school or something! - to the big screen without an iota of inspiration, ambition, or personality seeping in at any juncture."
5,dawn-of-the-dead-1979-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,"Undoubtedly the zombie movie to end 'em all... The horror/suspense content is brilliant enough to satisfy the most demanding fan, and the film uses superb locations like a huge shopping mall to further its Bosch-like vision of a society consumed by its own appetites. But take no munchies. "
6,bad-words-movie,Peter Keough,25,"Misogynistic, homophobic, scatological — none of these words come up in any of the spelling bees that take place in Jason Bateman’s directorial debut, but they apply to the film."
7,son-of-saul-movie,Inkoo Kang,100,It’s that devotion to truth that makes Son of Saul such a difficult watch — and also one of year’s most important masterpieces.
8,sils-maria-movie,Peter Debruge,90,Binoche leaves audiences with the same exhilarating feeling here — of having witnessed something precious and rare — answering the challenge of Assayas’ script by revealing a character incredibly closer to her soul.
9,the-long-kiss-goodnight-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,"If you haven't lived until you've heard Geena Davis say ""Suck my dick,"" New Line probably deserves your money."
10,atonement-movie,Rick Groen,75,It's an imperfect movie that serves as a perfect reminder of what the movies do best.
11,the-history-boys-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,Vibrates with exuberance and erudition.
12,the-incredibles-2-movie,Darren Franich,83,"Bird’s made the weirdest Pixar movie ever, revolutionary and retro, an anti-authoritarian ode to good parenting."
13,the-signal-2014-movie,Matt Glasby,80,"The best sci-fi trilogy you’ve never seen amalgamated into one organic whole. Surprising, exciting and, at times, strangely beautiful."
14,amazing-grace-movie,Nathan Rabin,75,"Unlike its subject, Amazing Grace won't change the world, but its quasi-religious sense of conviction proves rousing. Apted's unexpected crowd-pleaser is inspirational, but also surprisingly entertaining."
15,the-big-bang-movie,Stephen Holden,0,"With its red lighting and Hades-like smoke and fog, the lurid look of The Big Bang suggests a tacky disco inferno. I have a mental picture of the film's creators, stoned out of their minds on who knows what, cackling crazily as they outline a movie that would have more appropriately been titled ""The Big Goof."" "
16,the-philadelphia-story-movie,Joe Holleman,100,"It's shocking that Grant wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. [1 March 2005, p.E01]"
17,ninja-assassin-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"You don't go into a movie called Ninja Assassin expecting a hell of a lot, but this shockingly disjointed and relentlessly dull picture can't even deliver the martial-arts kick its title so plainly promises."
18,seabiscuit-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,80,"Aesop endowed animals with human traits to teach us lessons. Seabiscuit almost does the reverse. By means of Ross's adroit shooting and editing, we ourselves pound bravely along the track. "
19,s1m0ne-movie,David Sterritt,25,"Moves at a lumbering pace, peppered with ungainly gags and dramatic moments with little emotional power. The ironic commentary on show-biz superficiality is sabotaged by Niccol's failure to make his own story seem real."
20,the-immigrant-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,100,"Gray has a knack for wrapping big themes into an intimate embrace, and The Immigrant feels both epic and fine-grained."
21,rejoice-and-shout-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,Rejoice provides both a melodic education and a once-in-a-lifetime concert in one soul-stirring package.
22,entourage-movie,Brian Tallerico,38,"Without Piven and Dillon to keep it entertaining, it would be absolutely dreadful."
23,standing-in-the-shadows-of-motown-movie,Robert Wilonsky,80,"If there's a flaw with the film, it's that Justman doesn't trust his narrators enough; too often he'll stage a re-enactment while someone's talking, as if he's afraid the mere tales themselves won't hold our interest. But they will, as long as there's a kid slapping a bass, a sampler swiping a groove or some middle-aged couple slow dancing to Marvin Gaye or the Miracles."
24,the-life-of-david-gale-movie,J.R. Jones,10,"A new low for director Alan Parker, this trite mystery thriller does for capital punishment what his ""Mississippi Burning"" did for civil rights: with its muddled message, liberal piety, and slick Hollywood plot mechanics."
25,the-signal-2014-movie,Robert Abele,70,"Eubank's fizzy mix of self-conscious, set-piece image-making and small-scale human detail is admirable."
26,are-we-there-yet-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,30,Runs 96 minutes but feels like so much more. There is only one gag.
27,son-of-a-gun-movie,Chris Nashawaty,75,"Son of a Gun becomes a somewhat predictable but excitingly twisty heist film involving a double-dealing Russian heavy, a desperate femme fatale, and a fortune in gold bars. It has just enough muscle and style to make the familiar feel fresh."
28,quiet-chaos-movie,Ella Taylor,30,Not even the momentary participation extraordinaire of a vertically challenged famous filmmaker self-exiled from the United States can save this phony pseudo-drama from its final collapse into a heap of inconsequence and male vanity.
29,the-voices-movie,Chuck Bowen,12,"For most of the film's running time, one mistakes the main character's callousness for the filmmakers'."
30,12-strong-movie,Brian Truitt,63,"Hemsworth’s machismo is all real, though, and for two war-torn hours, you’ll forget about that iconic hammer of his."
31,no-strings-attached-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"Kutcher and Portman have terrific screen physics, using their 12-inch height difference to considerable slapstick effect."
32,hellboy-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"A perfect fit in the category of instant classic, and, not incidentally, fits the profile of super-profitability. Bursting the bonds of its genre, Hellboy fills the screen with gorgeous imagery, vertiginous action and a surprising depth of feeling."
33,neil-young-journeys-movie,Kalvin Henely,75,"As great and intimate as Live at Massey Hall 1971 may be, it's not as transportive as this filming of a Neil Young performance at the venue 30 years later. "
34,the-dukes-of-hazzard-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"The movie's so unfunny, it almost appears to be that way on purpose, kind of like an Ingmar Bergman film."
35,capturing-the-friedmans-movie,Howard Karren,88,Jarecki does a remarkable job with this easily exploitable material.
36,sideways-movie,Jack Mathews,100,"The best comedy of 2004. In fact, it's so far the best movie of the year."
37,anastasia-movie,Peter Stack,100,"A gorgeous piece of work. It pulls every heartstring a good romance should, yet bursts with G-rated fun, wonderfully human characters and several solid and hummable songs."
38,you-only-live-twice-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"Unfortunately, this is also among the weakest of the early Bond films, although Connery is in peak form."
39,something-borrowed-movie,Stephanie Merry,38,"Something Borrowed clinches it: It is not okay to sleep with the fiance of one's best friend. What's odd, and ultimately icky, is how enthusiastically the film attempts to justify doing so. "
40,8-women-2000-movie,Jonathan Foreman,12,More prettily photographed pretentious rubbish from the ridiculous Peter Greenaway.
41,henry-fool-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,I found it insufferably fatuous and damned near interminable. [26 Jun 1998]
42,chicken-run-movie,Steven Rea,100,"It's aimed at adults as much as children, with jokes that work on multiple levels, and contraptions."
43,the-layover-movie,Derek Smith,12,"William H. Macy's The Layover was clearly conceived and written by men who have no interest in approaching female friendships with any degree of complexity, curiosity, or respect. "
44,the-wedding-date-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"A witless, stale and half-hearted rehash of cliches borrowed from the likes of ""The Wedding Planner,"" ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" this pathetic, alleged comedy certainly wasn't improved by clueless direction by Clare Kilner."
45,the-devil-inside-movie,Wesley Morris,0,No one onscreen was actor enough to make us believe we were watching actual people commit or require actual exorcisms. 
46,american-pastoral-movie,Blake Goble,25,The film’s a fundamental fiasco of tone and timing.
47,company-man-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,20,The unfunniest comedy I can recall seeing in ages.
48,hotel-artemis-movie,Rex Reed,0,"Moronic drivel that truly qualifies as the worst movie of the year, it sinks amateurish moviemaking aimed at audiences with no taste to an alarming new low."
49,demonlover-movie,Stephen Holden,80,The entrancing visual imagery goes a long way toward filling in the screenplay's gaps in logic.
50,hellboy-movie,M. E. Russell,83,The movie's got a heart as warm as hellfire.
51,secretary-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"The characters in Secretary never feel the least bit human. Their quirks, sexual and otherwise, are all on the surface. Inside, where it counts, nobody's home."
52,the-cavemans-valentine-movie,Reece Pendleton,30,"Kasi Lemmons directed this tepid thriller, whose only genuinely creepy aspect is its cavalier and uninformed use of mental illness and classical music to heighten the meager suspense."
53,the-clay-bird-movie,Marta Barber,75,"For all its tumult, The Clay Bird mostly concentrates on its likable characters, all acted with the kind of understatement that makes a good film better. "
54,for-greater-glory-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"If For Greater Glory were a person, it would be wearing two different socks. It is a scattered mess, as earnest as a folk song, but like a folk song that goes on for two hours and 23 minutes. Not only does it never justify its epic length, it gets even the small things wrong."
55,barely-lethal-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"Treading the same halls as “Kick-Ass” and “Kingsman,” Barely Lethal imagines an academy of teen assassins. Life there is deadly, but not as scary as high school."
56,tulpan-movie,J. Hoberman,100,"In every respect, this unclassifiable movie is an amazing accomplishment."
57,thinner-movie,Michael Ollove,12,"Thinner provides little suspense and no chills, not to mention rather offensive treatment of Gypsies, Italians and women. Acting isn't at a premium either."
58,beautiful-people-movie,Jay Carr,63,"It's a spirited and essentially optimistic film, but it's also simplistic."
59,coffee-and-cigarettes-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,Flat and uninspired. 
60,bukowski-born-into-this-movie,Allison Benedikt,75,Raw and defining documentary about the man--and the myth.
61,the-tree-of-life-movie,Steve Persall,75,"Ponderous and perplexing, a somberly audacious film to make viewers swoon or snore, take your pick. It is defiantly opaque, a free-form meditation on nature and nurture across millennia with a tinge of biblical grace."
62,pokemon-the-movie-2000-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"Avoid this movie unless a) your child has refused to eat until you take him or her, or b) your house is being fumigated to kill an infestation of mosquitoes with the West Nile virus."
63,thirteen-ghosts-movie,Paul Malcolm,20,"A brutish affair replete with sliced bodies, a diced storyline and enough clanky dialogue to wake the dead."
64,guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,80,"To see an expensive, big-studio movie freed from creative constraints and directorial cynicism is always a rare and wondrous experience. In a season of bloated indulgence, it’s also fair to call it a marvel."
65,excess-baggage-movie,Darren Bignell,20,"However, it is probably the screenplay that is most at fault, and while ""Demolition Man"" director Brambilla again makes things look okay, his hands are tied with flat dialogue, zero comedy and not much caper, either."
66,despicable-me-3-movie,Justin Chang,10,"Under the pretext of offering fun for the whole family, the movie winds up doing almost precisely the opposite; its attempts at grown-up sophistication and cheeky, knowing humor are clueless and hectoring enough to leave any adult in the audience wishing they’d been straight-up ignored."
67,the-chronicles-of-narnia-the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"There's nothing too clean or too overbright about it. It's magic, but not the loud, shiny kind: It has the texture of worn velvet, or a painstakingly hand-knit sweater stored away for years in tissue paper."
68,the-lost-city-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,"Sometimes there's a fine line between a labor of love and a vanity project, and The Lost City, Andy Garcia's heartfelt - but hackneyed and interminable - love letter to his native Cuba, repeatedly crosses it."
69,the-challenge-movie,Diego Semerene,75,"Here the organic and the frivolously material aren't oppositions or rivals, but partners in a spectacle for men's eyes only."
70,man-on-the-train-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,"Goes from good to great in 90 minutes, and then it's over, except that it's really not, because this small masterwork grows even deeper and more affecting as it takes up permanent residence in your memory."
71,lucky-numbers-movie,Wesley Morris,63,An unsteady stab at noir.
72,dead-man-walking-movie,Elvis Mitchell,90,Quietly courageous drama .
73,meet-dave-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,20,"After his disastrous outing in 200X with ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash,"" there was no direction for Murphy to head but up in terms of another space alien movie. Indeed, Meet Dave is a step up, but that's only in relation to Pluto Nash."
74,the-bounty-hunter-movie,Kerry Lengel,70,"As formula films go, The Bounty Hunter is more enjoyable than most, even if it packs in as many cliches as any."
75,be-kind-rewind-movie,Keith Phipps,83,"The visual wit, game performances, and overflowing humanity have more than made up for the shortcomings by the time the film finds a final moment that's simultaneously abrupt and magical."
76,the-conjuring-2-movie,E. Oliver Whitney,30,"If The Conjuring is an example of the haunted house movie done right, The Conjuring 2 is an example of everything gone wrong. You can only retread old tropes so many times."
77,see-spot-run-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"Personally, I'd say that it was about time Arquette was leashed."
78,the-company-movie,Maitland McDonagh,70,"Though the ballets themselves are beautifully shot, they lean heavily in the direction of gimmicky and prop-heavy pieces; they're visually interesting but, by and large, they're not great dance. "
79,the-impossible-movie,Ed Gonzalez,12,"A sham realist's disaster movie, tackily insulting the deaths of 300,000 people by reducing the horrors of the Indian Ocean tsunami to a series of genre titillations."
80,like-someone-in-love-movie,Ty Burr,88,"The new film is slender, and it plays obliquely with the style of the 20th-century Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu: simple shots of simple people revealing universal truths."
81,freddy-got-fingered-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,25,Not since Andy Kaufman's reign of terror has a supposed funnyman been so self-indulgently persistent in testing a fan's patience.
82,finding-neverland-movie,Lou Lumenick,100,Pure magic. 
83,2016-obamas-america-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,Dinesh D'Souza's documentary is no mere screed: 2016: Obama's America is a nonsensically unsubstantiated act of character assassination.
84,burying-the-ex-movie,Chuck Bowen,25,"It alternates awkwardly between shrill, borderline misogynistic sex farce and desperately gory, pun-rife creature feature. "
85,abduction-movie,Stephen Holden,20,"A sloppy, exploitative act of star worship created (if that's the right word for cynical hackwork) around Mr. Lautner, the pouty 19-year-old heartthrob of the ""Twilight"" franchise. "
86,nine-lives-2016-movie,Nigel M Smith,20,It’s lazy on every level.
87,unknown-2011-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,Unknown actually has enough of a sense of humor to admit what it is: hybrid corn. But it's been crossbred from Hitchcockian stock.
88,house-of-fools-movie,V.A. Musetto,75,"Konchalovsky, best known here for ""Runaway Train"" (1985), takes on a difficult subject with a light mix of dark humor and pathos."
89,the-center-of-the-world-movie,Dana Stevens,20,"In a culture apparently defined by lap dancing, ersatz architectural sublimity and the virtual contact of cyberspace, how do we know what is real? The Center of the World,  for example, is as phony as can be."
90,my-blind-brother-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,25,"My Blind Brother is mirthless, though Kroll and Slate have a delightfully easy charm that occasionally rises above the tedium."
91,the-diving-bell-and-the-butterfly-movie,Lou Lumenick,100,You won't have a more viscerally emotional experience at the movies this year.
92,the-double-movie,Kalvin Henely,12,"If the idea of a political thriller with a modern-day Cold War theme resonates with you or something in our collective unconscious, my FOMO levels are higher than a lonely night on Facebook."
93,driven-movie,Michael Wilmington,38,"It's outrageously stereotypical and weirdly personal, so loonily exaggerated it keeps surprising you."
94,pride-2014-movie,Graham Fuller,80,"Among the actors, potential Oscar nominee Nighy is deeply affecting, but everyone in this rousing movie impresses. "
95,suicide-squad-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"It’s the kind of torment you can wish on your worst enemy without feeling too guilty, not something to inflict permanent damage, just two hours of soul-sickening confusion and sensory torment."
96,the-painted-veil-movie,Michael Sragow,83,"No one has caught the pride, remorse and pain of an unloved and possibly unlovable husband better than Edward Norton in The Painted Veil."
97,jarhead-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Jarhead isn't overtly political, yet by evoking the almost surreal futility of men whose lust for victory through action is dashed, at every turn, by the tactics, terrain, and morality of the war they're in, it sets up a powerfully resonant echo of the one we're in today."
98,whiplash-movie,James Rocchi,83,"The quest to be the best is a familiar film story, but if director-writer Chazelle has achieved anything here, it’s a deeply and richly different take on that journey—not only examining the cost of struggle but the reward of it, showing both what it takes to be great and what happens when you don’t have it."
99,fill-the-void-movie,A.A. Dowd ,91,"Burshtein shoots in extreme shallow focus, framing her actors against a sometimes-blinding blanket of white fuzz. It’s a decision that, coupled with Yitzhak Azulay’s stirring, chant-driven score, lends each conversation a near religious aura. "
100,grindhouse-movie,Mark Bell,90,"The only criticism that seems to merit any real discussion is whether directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino actually did make real grindhouse-style fare. To whit, I can easily say: yes, they not only made two on-point grindhouse films, they did them to painful perfection."
101,the-man-who-shot-liberty-valance-movie,Richard Brody,100,"It’s both the most romantic of Westerns and the greatest American political movie. But the movie is also romantic in another, intimate way—it’s a great love story and a painful triangle, involving the tenderfoot lawyer (James Stewart), his gunslinger friend (John Wayne), and the woman they both love (Vera Miles). "
102,on-the-line-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,Instantly forgettable.
103,no-one-lives-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,30,"Mr. Kitamura, an action enthusiast who prefers to show rather than tell, seems unaware that the film’s dialogue is laughable, its characters unfathomable and the acting often less than optimal."
104,max-keebles-big-move-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"A movie like this depends on clever bits and incidents, but there's little invention here to disguise the film's formulaic nature."
105,night-at-the-museum-battle-of-the-smithsonian-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"Oh, did I dislike this film. It made me squirm. Its premise is lame, its plot relentlessly predictable, its characters with personalities that would distinguish picture books."
106,the-informers-movie,Robert Abele,10,"Conjures up plenty of debauched tableaux with its photogenic, jaded showbiz denizens and hangers-on, but nary a reason for existing."
107,vera-drake-movie,William Arnold,91,"There's nothing harder for an actor to play than a thoroughly good character, and Staunton does it with a dowdy, sublime originality."
108,the-5th-wave-movie,Soren Andersen,38,This picture stands as the best argument yet that the YA dystopia cycle has passed its sell-by date.
109,bandits-1999-movie,Diana Abu-Jaber,16,One can only hope that the parties responsible for Bandits are brought to justice and someone can stop them before they film again.
110,looking-glass-movie,Glenn Kenny,38,The plot’s central mystery suffers from “Body Double” syndrome in that the movie has so few characters that the villain’s reveal can only elicit a shrug. 
111,envy-movie,Ty Burr,12,"A weirdly airless disaster, a turkey so insistently DOA that the dialogue serves as its own epitaph."
112,me-myself-irene-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"If you choose to see this puerile tripe, check your dignity at the door."
113,the-hammer-movie,Maitland McDonagh,75,"It's genuinely funny, oddly romantic and surprisingly engaging for what could easily have been an obnoxious vanity project."
114,albert-nobbs-movie,Peter Travers,75,"As directed with grit and grace by Rodrigo García, this quietly devastating film goes bone-deep."
115,take-my-eyes-movie,J.R. Jones,90,A harrowing drama spun from the most mundane material.
116,the-ottoman-lieutenant-movie,Stephanie Merry,37,"Morality is hardly the main concern of The Ottoman Lieutenant. Instead, it’s content with hackneyed romance and soaring strings."
117,after-dark-my-sweet-movie,Vincent Canby,70,"James Foley's After Dark, My Sweet is a brisk, entertaining contemporary melodrama about the kind of sleazy characters who populated California crime literature 35 years ago. That's no surprise, since the screenplay, adapted by Robert Redlin and Mr. Foley, is based on Jim Thompson's novel, published in 1955."
118,the-love-guru-movie,John Anderson,30,"The results are a wheezy, tired attempt to milk more laughs out of the '60s, by doing exactly what ""Austin Powers"" did."
119,a-streetcar-named-desire-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,Tennessee Williams' exciting Broadway stage play - winner of the Pulitzer Prize and New York Drama Critics award during the 1947-48 season - has been screenplayed into an even more absorbing drama of frustration and stark tragedy.
120,the-merry-gentleman-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,33,This Debbie Downer of a drama is a bitter slog.
121,hyde-park-on-hudson-movie,Connie Ogle,38,"Maybe there's a good movie to be made about the affair between Franklin Delano Roosevelt and a distant cousin. I wouldn't bet on it, and Hyde Park on Hudson isn't it in any case."
122,scary-movie-5-movie,Stephanie Merry,0,"Lazy, boring, vile and tragically unfunny attempt at a horror-film spoof. "
123,rescue-dogs-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,30,"There just aren't enough rescue dogs in the world to save ""Rescue Dogs,"" a shrill, yappy live-action comedy that proves considerably more annoying than adorable."
124,killer-joe-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Killer Joe is, at bottom - and I mean bottom - ugly and vile, not to mention dumb and clumsy."
125,stepmom-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"This is the kind of tearjerker that will cause audience members to cry, but only because they paid hard-earned money to see it."
126,liam-movie,Staff (Not credited),12,Liam's deck is stacked. It's too bleak and filled with abrasive characters who don't deserve our sympathy to reveal much new about the human condition.
127,jim-andy-the-great-beyond-featuring-a-very-special-contractually-obligated-mention-of-tony-clifton-movie,Greg Cwik,63,"The film is about the idea of Andy Kaufman, about how artists channel their influences and keep the dead alive."
128,open-hearts-movie,Kimberley Jones,89,The Dogme pedigree rarely distracts; there is too much emotional investment to care much about dogmatic fidelity.
129,black-november-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"As well-intentioned as it is thoroughly inept, Black November would be a serious contender for year-end worst lists if it weren’t so painfully noble and sincere."
130,eragon-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,10,"Eragon is laughably bad, mind-bogglingly derivative, and easily one of the worst movies of the year."
131,the-perfect-man-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"The range of Ms. Locklear's lobotomized acting runs from mild irritation to mild melancholy, expressed without expression."
132,carnage-2011-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"A lot of people have no use for Carnage, especially in its unapologetically hemmed-in film version. And yet there isn't a sloppily or casually considered shot in any of the 80 minutes."
133,the-accountant-movie,Steve Persall,25,"Ben Affleck is Agent Double-OCD in The Accountant, an effortlessly dumb thriller barely more entertaining than an audit."
134,vincent-theo-movie,Staff [Not Credited],90,One of Robert Altman’s most cinematically conventional films as well as one of his most deeply personal.
135,where-do-we-go-now-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,80,"While the schemes occasionally seem strained, their desperate determination is never less than compelling."
136,last-action-hero-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"The script is weak and unrelenting. The stunts are unspectacular. The special effects are nothing you haven't seen before. But worst of all, there's the spectacle of Schwarzenegger glorying in the wonder of Schwarzenegger. [18 Jun 1993, p.C1]"
137,13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi-movie,Peter Travers,25,"Is there an audience for this? Sadly, yes. There’s nothing wrong with a movie that cheers American heroes. But this one does so by reducing everything else to cardboard."
138,free-birds-movie,Liam Lacey,38,"Well-intended but maladroit, with a clever premise and cute animation that are undermined by the trite sci-fi parody plot and manic, unfunny banter."
139,the-homesman-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"The Homesman aims for a story that's poignant and told sparely, but comes across as mawkish, tedious and self-indulgent."
140,war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,100,"War for the Planet of the Apes may have the body of an action film, but it has the soul of an art-house drama and the brains of a political thriller."
141,chris-don-a-love-story-movie,David Ansen,80,"Intimate, moving and playful."
142,black-snake-moan-movie,David Edelstein,70,"It's outlandish, hilariously overripe, and possibly sexist: You'd expect no less from Craig Brewer, the writer and director who made the passionate case for how hard it is out there for a pimp. But I loved the picture's tabloid energy and heart."
143,ice-age-continental-drift-movie,Jaime N. Christley,12,"Caters almost exclusively to the remedial, Duplo Blocks demographic, leaving parents and guardians bored to distraction. "
144,dead-man-walking-movie,Sean Means,90,"Their (Sarandon, Penn) performances and Robbins' drive to ask questions without offering easy answers make Dead Man Walking a thought-provoking drama not to be missed or dismissed."
145,the-edge-of-seventeen-movie,Christy Lemire,88,The Edge of Seventeen is a strong successor to Hughes’ legacy with its mix of biting humor and bittersweet heart. 
146,air-force-one-movie,Desson Thomson,90,"Ford makes such a dynamic president in Air Force One, you may find yourself favorably weighing his odds in Iowa and New Hampshire."
147,scary-movie-movie,Wesley Morris,75,Deadly funny.
148,jauja-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,83,"Everything signals birth—of Argentina, cinema, the nuclear family—until Dinesen descends into a womb-like cave and Jauja takes a hard left turn into enigma. Even the title is a mystery, the Spanish byword for a land of plenty. "
149,broadway-idiot-movie,Kyle Ryan,25,This documentary by rookie director Doug Hamilton plays more like a featurette on an American Idiot DVD than a stand-alone film.
150,mental-movie,Gary Goldstein,30,"Writer-director P.J. Hogan may have based Mental on an actual incident from his childhood, but the crazy quilt of a movie that resulted feels anything but real."
151,poolhall-junkies-movie,David Ng,0,"A movie that, in its unconditional embrace of an all-male subculture, amounts to little more than a rote circle jerk."
152,the-sweet-hereafter-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,100,I can think of no other movie that has dared to analyze grief and its aftermath with such naked honesty and precision.
153,300-rise-of-an-empire-movie,Drew McWeeny,75,"300: Rise Of An Empire is a worthy sequel to ""300,"" stylistically consistent and equally loony, featuring what may well be the first truly can't-miss performance in a film this year."
154,mrs-parker-and-the-vicious-circle-movie,Roger Ebert,88,The great achievement of Alan Rudolph's Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle is that it allows us to empathize with Dorothy Parker on her long descent.
155,shaolin-soccer-movie,Ray Conlogue,75,One of Stephen Chow's extravagant and very funny martial-arts spoof movies.
156,steal-this-movie-movie,J. Hoberman,10,"At once simple-mindedly didactic and utterly chaotic, Steal This Movie! is interspersed with fake headlines and botched history."
157,shrink-movie,Wesley Morris,25,"This movie brings to mind much better cable TV shows like the marijuana comedy ""Weeds,’"" the one-on-one psychodramas of ""In Treatment,"" and the astonishingly cinematic ""Breaking Bad."""
158,mama-movie,Ed Gonzalez,12,"The premise isn't even worthy of executive producer Guillermo del Toro, who will apparently lend his name to any film as long as it fulfills its quota of moths and vulvic openings."
159,dead-man-down-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"While a mob thriller can be as nasty as it likes, what it can’t be is silly. "
160,the-insult-movie,Peter Rainer,91,"In the end, the film’s most nuanced summation comes from Wajdi, who says, “No one has a monopoly on suffering.”"
161,the-human-centipede-ii-full-sequence-movie,Andy Webster,10,"In place of novelty we have dank interiors (shades of ""Saw"") and black-and-white photography (à la ""Eraserhead""). Still missing is that lingering subtext, leaving only a lurid, splattery wallow in grime, blood and excrement. "
162,walk-the-line-movie,Ella Taylor,70,"An engaging biopic that would totally lack surprise were it not for Reese Witherspoon, and a healthy touch of ambivalence about the populist myth that bound The Man in Black to his adoring public."
163,stay-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,"Marc Forster takes a maximalist approach to this mumbo jumbo, which means that in addition to lots of wacky angles, shiny surfaces, seemingly endless stairs, and sets of twins, triplets and quadruplets, he deploys the unsettling vision of three talented actors - Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling - straining credulity and neck tendons in the service of serious claptrap."
164,a-view-to-a-kill-movie,Pauline Kael,30,"The James Bond series has had its bummers, but nothing before in the class of this one."
165,samson-movie,Peter Sobczynski,38,"The problem with Samson is that while it cannot be faulted for its sincerity, it can be faulted for its sluggish pacing, inconsistent performances and lack of cinematic style that gives the proceedings a tacky feel throughout."
166,the-week-of-movie,Brian Tallerico,38,This is still a perfect example of the market that Netflix seems intent to corner: Movies You Can Watch While You Play Games on Your Phone.
167,boy-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"This charming kid's-eye movie, full of comical and vivid detail about the lives of these cheerful children, has the loose, lanky feel of a memoir and of French New Wave films."
168,corpse-bride-movie,William Arnold,91,"One more good thing is that the movie doesn't overstay its welcome. At 76-minutes, it's wisely calculated to give us as much of its ghoulish whimsy as we can take in one sitting, and not a second more."
169,event-horizon-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,"If you haven't lived until you've seen Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill duke it out in a vat full of red paint, here's your chance; personally, my idea of hell would be having to see this stinker again."
170,dave-chappelles-block-party-movie,Michael Sragow,83,Some of the movie's sunniest moments arrive as Chappelle ambles through Ohio. He's an observational comic with a drawling syntax that's almost as sly as Mark Twain's.

177,upside-down-movie,Peter Sobczynski,88,This is one of the craziest films to come along in a while and I can confidently say that anyone who sees it will either hail it is some kind of crackpot masterpiece or dismiss it as one of the silliest damn things they've ever seen. 
178,liam-movie,Connie Ogle,63,"Wields some power, but it's hard to shake the feeling you've seen it all before."

181,species-movie,Staff (Not Credited),38,"Superb actors and the best special effects money can buy can only go so far when you have a second-rate script sprinkled with unintentional laugh lines. [07 July 1995, p.3E]"
182,borstal-boy-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"Sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy, and scotches most of its élan, humor, bile, and irony. What's left wouldn't have substantiated a memoir of any reputation, much less a movie."
183,casino-royale-1967-movie,Staff (Not Credited),30,"A film of astounding sloppiness, an insult to the Bond name (most likely deliberate) and a dark spot on the resumes of all involved (surely unintentional)."
184,best-worst-thing-that-ever-could-have-happened-movie,Jude Dry,100,"“Best Worst Thing” is more than a story about a Broadway show; its most poignant moments examine the thrill of dreams coming true, and the inevitable come down afterwards."

186,the-battle-of-shaker-heights-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,An insufferable piffle.
187,just-looking-movie,Chuck Wilson,10,"This sort of nostalgia-drenched, sexual-coming-of-age saga has been done to death."
188,the-bad-lieutenant-port-of-call---new-orleans-movie,A.O. Scott,90,"Mr. Herzog’s film is a pulpy, glorious mess. Its maniacal unpredictability is such a blast that it reminds you just how tidy and dull most crime thrillers are these days."
189,arbitrage-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"There's a touch of Hitchcockian flavor to the Arbitrage's cat-and-mouse thrills, yet the film clearly announces that there's now a third gifted Jarecki brother (in addition to Eugene and Andrew) to contend with in the moviemaking business."
190,skyscraper-movie,Sara Stewart,25,"There’s no better time than summer for a fun, brainless thriller. All you need is three key ingredients: a charismatic hero, a hateable villain and a snappy screenplay...Skyscraper, regrettably, cuts likable star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson off at the knees by failing to deliver on the other two.

193,genius-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Jude Law gives arguably the worst performance of his career as Wolfe in Genius, the ham-fisted directing debut of noted British theater figure Michael Grandage, bombastically adapted by John Logan (“Gladiator’’) from a biography by A. Scott Berg."
194,rocky-balboa-movie,Stephen Holden,70,"Surprisingly Rocky Balboa, is no embarrassment. Like its forerunners it goes the distance almost in spite of itself. It's all heart and no credibility except as a raw-boned fable."
195,honey-movie,Ernest Hardy,30,"Hinges almost completely on the taut body and delectable beauty of Jessica Alba, but is otherwise so riddled with limp clichés that it doesn't even qualify as a guilty pleasure."
196,wanderlust-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"So you think you've seen silly? And smarmy? And inept? Wait till you see Wanderlust, though that's just a figure of speech; I'm not suggesting that you actually lay eyes on this naked grab for box office bucks."
197,we-are-marshall-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"Its use of trite ""Win one for the Gipper"" dialogue, overbearing soaring music and conventional plot devices makes it far too formulaic to truly move us."
198,adore-movie,Peter Travers,38,"Working from a script by the gifted Christopher Hampton (Dangerous Liaisons, Atonement), who seems to have traded his wit for a paycheck, Fontaine manages the trick of making sex joyless. Like porn. Then she tops that by draining her film of variety, longing and feminist insight. Like farce. Ouch."
199,pollock-movie,Peter Travers,80,"Ed Harris, who plays Pollock and makes his debut as a director - doing both jobs superbly, by the way - is angst incarnate."
200,new-best-friend-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"90 minutes of ridiculous, silly fun. Of course, it's still a very bad movie."
201,wrath-of-the-titans-movie,Jaime N. Christley,0,"Made possible by the half a billion dollars Clash of the Titans garnered worldwide, Wrath of the Titans sputters and coughs on the fumes of its own inevitability."
202,slender-man-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Give White credit for the picture’s fairly eerie tone and look — darkened streets, foggy forests of spindly pines, shadows and more shadows. It’s just not worth more than the occasional hair-raising instant."
203,criminal-activities-movie,Simon Abrams,38,"Director Jackie Earle Haley's Criminal Activities is the worst kind of Tarantino clone, one with no gas in the tank, and no clue about how to pull off Tarantino's swagger."
204,quest-2017-movie,Barry Hertz,88,"There is no grand narrative or point to be hammered home; instead, Olshefski delivers a subtle, sincere and honest portrait of barely making ends meet in modern America."
205,detective-dee-and-the-mystery-of-the-phantom-flame-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"On the basis of its scale, energy and magical events, this is the Hong Kong equivalent of a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. But it transcends them with the stylization of the costumes, the panoply of the folklore, the richness of the setting, and the fact that none of the characters (allegedly) have superpowers."
206,osmosis-jones-movie,Sean Axmaker,83,"Surprise of surprises, it's a blast."
207,scrooged-movie,Donna Britt,25,"Scrooged is so monumental a mess that even rabid Bill Murray fans - the ones who'll stand in line to see it despite critics' inevitable bashings - will wonder how it went so wrong. [23 Nov 1988, p. 9D]"
208,the-mountain-between-us-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,70,"Despite some frightening (and effective) scenes of slippery slopes and aggravated wildlife, the film’s heart lies in watching these characters discover in themselves and each other the will to press on."
209,notfilm-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,90,"[A] studious, rigorous, and surprisingly tender documentary."
210,fleeing-by-night-movie,Derek Elley,10,An embarrassing failure at almost every level.
211,closed-curtain-movie,Peter Keough,88,"The opening and closing scenes of this film evoke those in “Crimson Gold.” They are long shots of the outside as seen through a security gate. In “Crimson Gold,” the view is of a chaotic street in Tehran. Here, it is the empty sea. This difference demonstrates what Panahi has been deprived of, and what the world has lost because of it."
212,ghost-world-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"Offers an exquisite tour of the twilight zone between high school and the so-called real world, as well as between bohemian subculture and the even stranger culture of America at large."
213,the-perfect-holiday-movie,J.R. Jones,10,Wretched yuletide comedy.
214,a-guy-thing-movie,Kim Morgan,16,"Chris Koch exhibits little flair for comedic direction and, though this isn't saying much, you'd be better served watching his previous film, ""Snow Day."" Ouch."
215,november-movie,Michael Sragow,12,"Brand's script is a puzzle without a satisfying solution. Even at its supposedly heartfelt conclusion, it's more ironic than emotional, more of an art thing than a suspense movie."
216,magic-mike-movie,Barbara VanDenburgh,70,"Skeptical at first, perhaps a little embarrassed, but before you know it, you're having a blast."
217,the-little-vampire-movie,Sara Wildberger,63,The movie is a little long for kids.
218,the-family-stone-movie,Robert Wilonsky,70,"As ridiculous, as mawkish and schizophrenic as The Family Stone is, it's also surprisingly endearing."
219,the-house-of-mirth-movie,Wesley Morris,100,"Her (Anderson) performance is a study in the difference between hubris and pride, remarkable for how unshowy but profoundly devastating it is."
220,chiraq-movie, Aisha Harris,80,"Lee has managed to again make a movie worth debating, wrestling with, and maybe even hating, depending upon how you feel about him as a director. "
221,hairbrained-movie,Chris Klimek,70,"Kent’s photography is so energetic, and the soundtrack is so sprightly—it features jagged tunes from beloved cult act The Feelies, as well as other, less familiar indie bands—that the thinness of the characterization slips by almost unnoticed."
222,quiz-show-movie,James Berardinelli,88,One of the reasons that Quiz Show is so extraordinary is because it spins a story as compelling on the personal level as on the national one.
223,awake-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"With a running time of 78 minutes, Awake is relatively painless, playing a little like a lesser story from one of EC Comics Shock SuspenStories – or a lot like Joseph Cotten's ""Breakdown"" episode of Alfred Hitchock Presents – updated for the Fangoria generation."
224,star-wars-episode-ii---attack-of-the-clones-movie,Todd McCarthy,90,"George Lucas has reached deep into the trove of his self-generated mythological world to produce a grand entertainment that offers a satisfying balance among the series' epic, narrative, technological and emotional qualities."
225,the-secret-of-kells-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Teaches important lessons in the most casual, joyful way. How it manages to do that is probably the biggest secret of all."
226,the-cabin-in-the-woods-movie,Steve Persall,100,"The Cabin in the Woods isn't merely another ""Scream"" exercise in self-awareness, or a ""Scary Movie"" spoof of the same. It's a wickedly smart hybrid mutation, biting the severed hand feeding the genre."
227,at-any-price-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"This is a brave, layered film that challenges the wisdom of victory at any price. Both of its central characters would slip easily into conventional plot formulas, but Bahrani looks deeply into their souls and finds so much more. "
228,winnie-the-pooh-movie,A.O. Scott,80,It is comfortable with itself and confident in its ability to amuse and beguile young viewers. 
229,now-movie,Steve Persall,16,Niccol fashioned an uninspired and downright dull sci-fi gimmick and doesn't even explain how it happened.
230,lean-on-pete-movie,Leah Greenblatt,91,"Pete is no kind of fairytale; instead, it’s something far sadder and better and more real."
231,land-of-the-lost-movie,Roger Ebert,75,I guess you have to be in the mood for a goofball picture like this. I guess I was.
232,blue-valentine-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"The cumulative experience leaves an aftertaste that, although not bitter, is too strong to be easily washed away. That's the mark of a worthwhile motion picture. "
233,the-wackness-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"Nostalgic for those bad old days, The Wackness was shot at a time when it actually looked like ""America's Mayor"" was going to be in a position to perform a similar cleanup on the entire country. That, of course, turned out to be a pipe dream."
234,beauty-shop-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,A cut above what you'd expect from the spinoff of a sequel.
235,femme-fatale-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"If you look hard, you can make out a story in Femme Fatale, but it has nothing to do with the senseless pileup of jewel thievery, shutterbug voyeurism, and leggy sex bombs so shallow and bad they seem to have come out of a 1978 copy of Hustler magazine."
236,rumor-has-it-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"Stay away: Everything about the movie is rinky-dink, from its phony, lifeless dialogue to its drab, shabby sitcom look to its choppy editing, all of which can wear on you after 95 minutes that come to feel like an eternity."
237,get-shorty-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"One of the pleasures of Get Shorty is watching the way the plot moves effortlessly from crime to the movies - not a long distance, since both industries are based on fear, greed, creativity and intimidation."
238,inside-man-movie,Stephen Hunter,80,"A deft, tense, pure thriller, the movie has great star turns and is brilliantly directed, but it began as an extremely well-crated screenplay by Russell Gewirtz. It's professionally entertaining."
239,enemy-movie,Rodrigo Perez,100,Enemy is a transfixing grand slam that certifies Villeneuve as the real deal and one of the most exciting new voices in cinema today.
240,i-can-only-imagine-movie,Frank Scheck,10,"Like so many faith-based efforts, I Can Only Imagine suffers from a terminal case of self-importance."
241,my-cousin-vinny-movie,Desson Thomson,70,"The movie, however, is Pesci's. In that courtroom, he gets on a roll and stays rolling until the end. There's no one better with that New York-New Jersey corridor accent."
242,gimme-shelter-2014-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,0,Writer-director Ron Krauss's Gimme Shelter is wretched long before its odious ulterior motives come to light. 
243,tin-men-movie,Rita Kempley,90,"Tin Men is a tale of transitions and a test of mettle, as sweet as a slow dance, as classy and cumbersome as a Coupe de Ville."
244,sherlock-holmes-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"The less I thought about Sherlock Holmes, the more I liked ""Sherlock Holmes."" Yet another classic hero has been fed into the f/x mill, emerging as a modern superman."
245,license-to-wed-movie,Mary Elizabeth Williams,0,One unbelievably crappy movie.
246,borat-cultural-learnings-of-america-for-make-benefit-glorious-nation-of-kazakhstan-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"Borat is an astonishingly entertaining picture, and it's a testament to Cohen's gifts that he can pull off a feat as extravagant and as fully realized as this one is."
247,heading-south-movie,Phil Hall,100,"Cantet weaves a dark, disturbing story of hedonism, casual racism and the lethal consequences of self-indulgence in his superb drama Heading South."
248,black-knight-movie,Paul Malcolm,0,"""It's no longer funny, but he refuses to give up the joke."" That just about sums it up except for the film's shopworn plot --  and its wretchedly cheap production design."
249,valentine-movie,Cody Clark,4,"Because so little of what occurs on-screen either engages or entertains, there's ample time for the boiler of your self-respect to build up quite a head of indignation at the forfeiture of your time, money, and (exceedingly minimal) cerebral exertion."
250,the-ultimate-life-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,25,"The message of The Ultimate Life could be summed up on a greeting card. Or rather, 12 greeting cards."
251,snow-angels-movie,Marc Mohan,91,The result feels less like selling out than growing up.
252,arrival-movie,Dan Jolin,100,"Arrival is a beautifully polished puzzle box of a story whose emotional and cerebral heft should enable it to withstand nit-picky scrutiny. And like all the best sci-fi, it has something pertinent to say about today’s world; particularly about the importance of communication, and how we need to transcend cultural divides and misconceptions if we’re to survive as a species."
253,i-frankenstein-movie,Andrew Barker,10,"Utterly witless, listless, sparkless and senseless, this supernatural actioner makes one long for the comparative sophistication of the conceptually identical “Underworld” franchise (with which it shares producers and a writer)."
254,thirst-movie,Michael Phillips,88,Be warned: Thirst is one of those pictures that tacks on another chapter just when you think it’s wrapping up.
255,about-last-night-movie,Richard Roeper,75,"The four leads are enormously likable and there’s still enough sharp, raunchy, sexy humor for me to recommend this version."
256,jayne-mansfields-car-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Overall, the rambling Jayne Mansfield’s Car is almost as big a wreck as its namesake."
257,sabrina-1995-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,75,"To redo such a sentimental gem without Hepburn's incandescence to light the way seems foolhardy at best, but director Sydney Pollack (Tootsie) miraculously almost pulls off his updated homage simply by choosing well and popping enough champagne corks to make us believe the wealthy are still glamorous despite Donald Trump. [15 Dec 1995, p.1D]"
258,mr-deeds-movie,Michael Atkinson,0,Stay home. Your entertainment-seeking efforts would be better expended perusing old phone books. The white pages.

260,all-the-kings-men-movie,Noel Murray,33,The movie's more damnable problem is it irrelevance.
261,superman-returns-movie,Scott Foundas,100,"Superman Returns is a lush and enthralling piece of adventure storytelling that's both revisionist AND reverential, putting a timely spin on a timeless character without violating his primal appeal."
262,alex-cross-movie,Joe Williams,25,Formulaic serial-killer crapola.
263,the-rum-diary-movie,David Edelstein,30,"The Rum Diary has no mighty gonzo wind. Even with a push from its Thompson-worshipping star, Johnny Depp, it leaves our freak flag limp. "
264,town-country-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"The script's tone veers chaotically -- and ambitiously -- at once aiming for a Noel Coward kind of elegant sparring, then for the lightly raunchy, rompy absurdism of ""What's New, Pussycat?"""
265,diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-2-rodrick-rules-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,38,"You can't fault the filmmakers for reshaping a diary into a cohesive film. You can however, fault them for taking one of the great antiheroes in preteen literature and turning him into, well, an even wimpier kid."
266,just-wright-movie,Ty Burr,63,"Just Wright is as formulaic as they come, but at its core is a surprisingly tender romantic drama."
267,salinger-movie,David Denby,30,"The movie is like a monstrous balloon that keeps re-inflating. If Salinger were around, he would reach for a pin."
268,i-love-you-to-death-movie,Staff (Not Credited),63,The result is a one-joke movie.
269,jack-and-jill-movie,Marc Savlov,11,I'm not sure which is more freakish: the fact that this savagely unfun and relentlessly generic Adam Sandler comedy has spawned its own (infinitely more entertaining) Internet meme or the realization that something has gone seriously awry with the decision-making process of Al Pacino's agent.
270,the-butterfly-effect-movie,Charles Taylor,20,It's like receiving a box of Valentine's chocolates in which someone has deliberately hidden ground glass. Flee. 
271,harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-movie,Scott Foundas,90,"Generally grim, occasionally startling, and altogether enthralling sixth chapter in a movie franchise that keeps managing to surprise just when one would expect it to be puttering along on auto-broomstick."
272,night-watch-nochnoi-dozor-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"A fractious fiasco: whiplash camera movement set to raging blasts of death metal, a story so incoherent it made me wish I was watching, instead, the collected outtakes from Van Helsing."
273,green-lantern-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"For a movie that touts the importance of humanity, Green Lantern is a strangely lifeless spectacle."
274,jimmy-neutron-boy-genius-movie,F. X. Feeney,80,"A witty, well-crafted comedy that combines primal slapstick with sharp satiric banter to keep children and parents laughing together."
275,norbit-movie,Rob Nelson,10,"It's an astonishingly crass and vulgar film, crudely directed on a cut-rate budget by Brian Robbins, never more than almost funny or less than disturbing."
276,austin-powers-the-spy-who-shagged-me-movie,Patrick Williams,10,Kills whatever charm the first movie had by recycling its few serviceable parts.
277,the-bye-bye-man-movie,Roger Moore,38,"The Bye Bye Man is a moldy slice of Wisconsin-set cheese, a horror film that manages as many unwanted laughs as frights."
278,porkys-movie,Dave Kehr,20,"It's as if Russ Meyer had made ""Death Wish III"" with an adenoidal cast, though it isn't that good."
279,norman-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,"There's a winning emotional truth in the father-son scenes in this Spokane-shot sleeper, directed with skill and sensitivity by Jonathan Segal."
280,savages-movie,Pete Hammond,80,Savages is one of Stone's best movies with a ménage et trois love story giving some human dimension to its three young leads.
281,the-invasion-movie,Steven Rea,63,"Mostly about delivering thrills, and chills, and this it does with moderate success and a bunch of fast, no-nonsense edits."
282,rachel-getting-married-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"At times, the movie gets bogged down in minutia but the emotions evoked and captured are as honest and brutal as one is likely to find on film."
283,overboard-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"This hilarious and touching romantic comedy recalls the integrated plotting and sophisticated dialogue of '30s Hollywood. Russell is excellent as overgrown kid Dean; Hawn gives her best performance to date as the hapless heiress turned gutsy wife and mother (the kids aren't just cutely naughty, they're truly obnoxious); and Marshall's faultless timing makes the most of Leslie Dixon's neatly contrived situations and snappy dialogue."
284,selma-movie,Barbara VanDenburgh,90,"It is not hyperbole to say Oyelowo is a revelation. The British actor brings phenomenal humanity, grace and torment to a historical figure who once seemed to loom too large a legend to make flesh on screen."
285,new-york-new-york-1977-movie,Staff (Not Credited),70,"In a final burst from Old Hollywood, Minnelli tears into the title song and it’s a wowser."
286,the-diving-bell-and-the-butterfly-movie,Claudia Puig,75,"Whereas the book was lyrical and moving, the movie is surrealistic and inventive."
287,mr-brooks-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"A curious mix of the campy and the intelligent, of high concept and low psychology. In spite of these contradictions, or perhaps because of them, it works. This is a tense and engaging thriller."
288,malibus-most-wanted-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"The film feels like a truly awful ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch padded out to such unholy lengths as to make ""It's Pat"" seems like a comic masterstroke."
289,grudge-match-movie,John DeFore,30,The movie only wakes up when Hart and/or Arkin are on screen (preferably together).
290,blaze-movie,Peter Stack,75,"The film, with Newman's riveting performance, is an exceptional portrait of an oddball politician who is equal parts scoundrel and folk hero, wielding power with a quirky, almost cantankerous charm, while also pulling strings in a loyal and powerful Southern political machine. [13 Dec 1989, p.E1]"
291,everything-must-go-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"At the end, I was expecting more of an emotional payoff; making a movie calm is one thing, and making it matter-of-fact is another. But make a note about Will Ferrell. There is depth there. "
292,chips-movie,John Semley,12,"It’s not uniquely bad, nor so bad it’s good. It’s factually, quantifiably bad. Overcooked, underdressed, sloppy, indigestible: just your classic crap hamburger of a movie."
293,town-country-movie,Kenneth Turan,10,"Seems merely tired and stale, the opposite of fresh, marked by ideas for jokes rather than things that are actually funny. Then, without warning, it goes from inept to complete disaster, sinking from indifferent to fiasco in the blink of an eye."
294,games-people-play-new-york-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,Sets a new nadir in the reality genre's race to the bottom. The price of sacrificing dignity for the amusement of the general public gets lower every day.
295,the-crying-game-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,"One of the best movies I've seen this year and, consequently, the less said about it here the better. The beauty of this movie is in the way it twists and turns, thwarting expectations, confounding stereotypes and venturing into places you least anticipate."
296,the-adventures-of-sharkboy-and-lavagirl-3-d-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"The result is astoundingly boring and, frankly, tedious to sit through."
297,the-forgotten-movie,William Arnold,91,"It struck me as the most exciting and original Hollywood thriller, occult or otherwise, since ""The Sixth Sense."""
298,serendipity-movie,Connie Ogle,75,"Serendipity's finale is a perfect crowd-pleaser, sweet and unlikely and over the top."
299,broadway-the-golden-age-by-the-legends-who-were-there-movie,Scott Foundas,80,"Rick McKay's exceptional new documentary Broadway: The Golden Age presents a veritable avalanche of interviews with some of the biggest names in the history of the American theater, preserving for posterity their wise words and disarming anecdotes."
300,being-17-movie,Brad Wheeler,88,"Age in Being 17 comes in awkward bursts, and yet the film moves sublimely. Director Téchiné, 73 years old, is wise beyond his years."
301,the-savages-movie,Ty Burr,88,"Smartly written and beautifully played, The Savages is about that point in life where you look around and realize that where you are is probably as far as you're going to get. In spite of this, the movie's a comedy, dry and humane."
302,some-velvet-morning-movie,Sam Adams,20,"The dialogue is the stuff of rapidly closing Off Broadway plays; the camerawork is flavorless and haphazard. Tucci hits every line like he’s about to break into a malicious tap dance, and Eve looks as if she was handed her script on the way to the set."
303,hick-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,Even an appearance by Alec Baldwin as Moretz's eventual - if highly unlikely - savior isn't enough to keep Hick from leaving a bad taste.
304,toy-story-2-movie,David Ansen,100,"The superrealist images beguile us with their bold wit, and the storytelling is so tight, urgent and inventive there doesn't seem to be a wasted moment. Which makes you wonder -- why can't scripts this clever be written for human beings?"
305,eyes-without-a-face-re-release-movie,J. Hoberman,90,"A masterpiece of poetic horror and tactful, tactile brutality."
306,fences-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"This is Denzel Washington’s third at bat behind the camera while directing himself and, holy smokes, does he knock it out of the park with a vicious, visceral performance that fairly sets the screen ablaze."
307,dumb-and-dumberer-when-harry-met-lloyd-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"Yes, I've seen Dumb and Dumberer, so you don't have to.  As good deeds go, this is about as significant as getting a cat out of a tree, but believe me, you're better off at home, alphabetizing your old comic books, talking to your parents, or watching paint dry."
308,norm-of-the-north-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,30,"While the film, with its preponderance of potty jokes, might placate the very young already primed by boisterous singing chipmunks, older viewers will likely find it all harder to, uh, bear."
309,the-misandrists-movie,Glenn Kenny,75,"This plot sounds like “The Beguiled,” right? Trust me, this movie is NOTHING like “The Beguiled,” For one thing, it’s not nearly as plot-driven."
310,loves-labours-lost-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,Misguided version of one of the Bard's best comedies.
311,fat-albert-movie,Robert Dominguez,25,"Somewhere in its quest to be educational, Fat Albert forgot to be entertaining."
312,the-stepford-wives-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,"A Frankenstein's monster of a movie: clumsy, patched together from parts that don't align properly, desperate to be loved, destined to be chased by mobs with pitchforks - those will be the critics - until it stumbles into its grave. "
313,21-grams-movie,David Denby,30,"The kind of bad movie that makes a reviewer feel terrible. It has been put together with great sincerity, and yet, impassioned and affecting as some of it is, 21 Grams is also an arrogant failure.  [24 November 2003, p. 113]"
314,in-the-land-of-blood-and-honey-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,"Where In the Land of Blood and Honey falls short, then, is in the story itself. Too many coincidences and, ultimately, too narrow a focus. But it is a genuinely noble effort, a worthy attempt to make some sense of the inexplicable."
315,thank-you-for-smoking-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"As the substantially faithful movie version demonstrates, the story of Thank You for Smoking resides in that libertarian netherworld where the far left and the far right march shoulder to shoulder."
316,death-wish-movie,Jake Cole,0,"At a time when Americans are constantly bombarded with reports of unpunished police brutality, the film suggests that the true problem with justice in our country is that law enforcement isn't violent enough. "
317,i-now-pronounce-you-chuck-larry-movie,Ken Fox,38,"In what can only be described as a throwback to the awkward ""gay"" farces of the 1970s and '80s -- think ""The Ritz"" and ""Partners -- this painfully uncomfortable buddy comedy trips all over itself to say something positive while still managing to offend. Worse still, it's just not funny."
318,the-salton-sea-movie,Desson Thomson,30,Far too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility.
319,before-midnight-movie,Bob Mondello,90,Delpy and Hawke have never been more persuasive. Nor has the series.
320,crossing-over-movie,Vadim Rizov,67,"Tied together with endless, flattening shots of L.A.’s cloverleaf freeways, Crossing Over is often simplistic and occasionally lugubrious, but it's rarely boring."
321,garden-state-movie,Duane Byrge,80,Writer/director Zach Braff has threaded a powerful and intelligent personal story through a genre all too rare today – romantic comedy.
322,broken-arrow-movie,Barry Walters,88,"Broken Arrow isn't the ultimate fusion of Hong Kong surrealism and Hollywood realism, but it points the way to nerve-shattering possibilities."
323,code-46-movie,Desson Thomson,70,"You may soon forget the specifics of the plot, but you'll always remember the world it came from. "
324,poetry-movie,Noel Murray,83,"Whenever all the pieces are in place, though, Lee reverts to the kind of storytelling he does best."
325,clash-of-the-titans-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,30,"Unlike the original -- which, in a crazy stroke of genius, allowed Shakespearean thespians like Claire Bloom and Maggie Smith, plus Bond babe Ursula Andress, to mix it up as jealous goddesses -- the new Clash of the Titans is frightfully low on babes."
326,grind-movie,Jennie Punter,12,"I think the guy who exited the advance screening after less than 15 minutes said it best. ""This movie's garbage,"" he hollered, as the audience members tittered and shuffled their feet, which they continued to do throughout this humourless, hackneyed yawnfest."
327,bossa-nova-movie,Shawn Levy,67,"May not carry great emotional or intellectual weight, but, in a slim and fetching way, it's peachy."
328,catch-and-release-movie,Jennie Punter,38,"Despite their hackneyed characters, Smith and Lewis create a tiny spark and add a little humour. Without them, Catch and Release would be totally dead in the water."
329,affliction-movie,Gene Seymour,90,Rarely have a novelist and filmmaker been better matched.
330,20-dates-movie,Sandra Contreras  ,30,"The film's most consistently entertaining element is Berkowitz's backer, a shady character named Elie Samaha who never appears on camera. Samaha's expletive-laden harangues, in which he orders Berkowitz to beef up the movie's T&A factor, are priceless."
331,the-secret-of-my-succes-movie,Bill Cosford,25,"Think for a moment about a film that depends for much of its appeal upon a romance between Michael J. Fox and Helen Slater. No, not as May-December or even July-August, but June-June, as in peers in love. It's Smurf-meets-girl -- not just a mismatch, but a confusion of species. [10 Apr 1987, p.D1]"
332,master-and-commander-the-far-side-of-the-world-movie,William Arnold,83,"The music, art direction and camerawork blend together with an integrity and scope that's wonderfully exhilarating. Every frame seems to communicate the grandeur, power and fatal pull of the sea."
333,rock-the-kasbah-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,25,"Sexist, racist, overlong, dull, visually ugly and, worst of all, unfunny, “Kasbah” squanders its cast."
334,white-noise-movie,Staff (Not credited),30,Muddled and boring.
335,jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-movie,Emma Stefansky,65,"There is a little bit of the wonder and joy that made the original so special embedded deep within Fallen Kingdom, which I credit to Bayona, whose primary drive, even in genre fare like this, has always been to sprinkle just enough emotion into the stories he tells."
336,harvard-man-movie,Scott Tobias,30,"Channels Toback in his purest form, which will probably be a treat for auteurists and a headache for just about everyone else."
337,voice-from-the-stone-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,38,"For far too long, nothing especially creepy or unsettling happens on screen."
338,no-end-in-sight-movie,Rick Kisonak,100,"No End In Sight is the most important film of the year thus far and, more significantly, the most comprehensive, clear-eyed account of the Iraq debacle and the arrogance behind it that we have."
339,phantom-thread-movie,Kimberley Jones,100,"What sets Phantom Thread apart is that it isn’t an apologia, or an exorcism. It’s a Valentine. The heart, after all, is our strongest muscle."
340,sarah-silverman-jesus-is-magic-movie,David Edelstein,80,It has its own explosively twisted originality. It's a geyser of exhilarating tastelessness.
341,little-nicky-movie,Charles Taylor,10,Sandler deserves to be damned to the pits of hell for this witless masturbatory comedy.
342,indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"It miraculously pulled off the effect of feeling like a surprise: The picture both fulfilled some vague, unexpressed hopes I didn't know I had and also left me with the sense that I'd just seen something I wasn't quite prepared for -- the kind of contradiction that great showmanship can bridge."
343,3000-miles-to-graceland-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"Costner's not a mannered showboat, and what we get isn't a riff—it's a semi-oblivious glimpse of bitter outlaw banality."
344,girlfight-movie,Jonathan Foreman,88,"Refreshing and surprising, the way independent movies are supposed to be."
345,lost-in-translation-movie,Desson Thomson,80,"Thanks to two delightful performers, you're drawn powerfully to the outcome. "
346,margot-at-the-wedding-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,90,"Noah Baumbach has followed up his acclaimed 2005 breakthrough ""The Squid and the Whale"" with another wryly observed, giddily cringe-inducing, bracingly original winner."
347,the-way-home-movie,Edward Guthmann,75,"A sweet, unabashedly sentimental tale."
348,mrs-doubtfire-movie,Robert Faires,30,"It's just raw, uncoated stupidity that sticks in your throat."
349,while-were-young-movie,Catherine Shoard,100,An almost perfect 90-minute hit of confident and inspired comedic commentary.
350,maborosi-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Maborosi is one of those valuable films where you have to actively place yourself in the character's mind. There are times when we do not know what she is thinking, but we are inspired with an active sympathy. We want to understand. Well, so does she."
351,remember-me-movie,Kimberley Jones,78,"There is, quite simply, a rather refreshing ordinariness to Remember Me in the unflashy, knuckle-down attention it gives to character development and the building of plausible and involving family and friend dynamics."
352,eyes-wide-shut-movie,Liam Lacey,100,"Eyes Wide Shut still towers above most of the movies out there, immersing the viewer in a web of emotional complexity, at once raw and personal and, at times, theatrically overcooked."
353,son-of-the-mask-movie,Chuck Wilson,30,"Most of the animated sequences, capably mixed with live action, leave a bad aftertaste, particularly when the ultimate fate of one beaten and battered human bystander after another is left callously unresolved. In other words, parents beware."
354,the-moment-movie,David Ehrlich,0,"The Moment is a stilted, asinine Hitchcockian exercise that ultimately serves as little more—and often considerably less—than a needless reminder of how difficult it is to execute this kind of material."
355,must-read-after-my-death-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"As with ""Capturing the Friedmans,"" the documentary is grueling to sit through. Yet the greasy, guilty thrill of being privy to your neighbors' most intimate dramas makes it impossible to stop watching."
356,3000-miles-to-graceland-movie,Stephen Hunter,0,"What you get is the V trifecta: vile, vicious and violent. Oh, and incoherent and stupid. A mess. A mean-spirited completely worthless film that can never give back the two hours it seizes from you."
357,walk-hard-the-dewey-cox-story-movie,Jack Mathews,75,"This kind of parody is hard to sustain for an hour and a half, and ""Walk Hard"" does gets wearying at times. But the humor is so outrageous, the original music so much fun and Reilly so good - both while hamming it up in the role and in singing the songs - that it's irresistible."
358,turn-it-up-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,Features less than 10 minutes of music in its mercifully brief 83-minute running time.
359,i-love-you-man-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,By far the best Judd Apatow comedy that Judd Apatow had nothing at all to do with.
360,perfect-stranger-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Life is full of choices, and Halle Berry has made another bad one with Perfect Stranger, a perfectly off-putting thriller."
361,bulworth-movie,Elvis Mitchell,70,"Its best moments come from witnessing the Senator's inspired unraveling, not from watching where it will end."
362,igby-goes-down-movie,Ty Burr,88,"Across the board, the performances testify, often hilariously, to the pain these characters feel and inflict but are incapable of expressing."
363,religulous-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,30,"His scattershot and ad hominem attacks against many different forms of religious hypocrisy don't add up to a coherent critique, and he's not qualified to provide one."
364,world-war-z-movie,Steve Persall,91,"World War Z presents an abundance of relatively plausible action, smart solutions and one useful piece of information: When the zombiepocalypse comes, the undead are flying coach."
365,the-other-sister-movie,Rita Kempley,30,"The Other Sister is sanctimonious, sanitized fare primarily preoccupied with patting its own back and plucking our heartstrings."
366,a-love-divided-movie,Kimberley Jones,30,"The actors do a fine, if unsoulful, job, but the real problem with A Love Divided is its unwillingness to unromanticize its heroes."
367,the-mill-and-the-cross-movie,Alison Willmore,91,"While it's far from easy going, The Mill And The Cross is worth attempting for its stunning visuals alone. "
368,cool-hand-luke-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,100,"One of the sharpest prison dramas ever, although it's graced with some very humorous portions as well."
369,oliver-twist-movie,Ryan Devlin,75,"It's worth noting that Oliver Twist will likely be no Harry Potter at the box office, due in no small part to a lack of bombastic special effects and supernatural subplots, yet it's nearly as entertaining, even without the wizardry."
370,girl-most-likely-movie,Calum Marsh,0,"Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini's dismal, D-grade sitcom isn't fit to lick the boots of Whit Stillman's four films."
371,step-up-3-d-movie,Michelle Orange,30,"Meant to take the scrappy and often ingeniously choreographed dance sequences to the next level, the result is stalled between floors: Some sick moves get even sicker; some become distorted and freakishly distracting."
372,galaxy-quest-movie,Rita Kempley,70,Funny without being flip.
373,the-majestic-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,The worst would-be-big-and-Capraesque-but-actually-bloated-and-bloviating-beyond-belief movie of the year.
374,lantana-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,80,Striking for its performances -- especially Anthony LaPaglia.
375,cradle-2-the-grave-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,"With so little trust and even less dialogue to back him up, it's no wonder Li rarely takes his left hand out of his pants pocket. His fists aren't furious; they're on strike."
376,the-last-airbender-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"The filmmaker has delivered yet another iteration of what has become a classic M. Night Shyamalan film, only much bigger than before, and, as a consequence, mind-bendingly turgid."
377,the-king-is-alive-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"Becomes a strung-together collection of interesting, semi-interesting, boring and sometimes embarrassing (seemingly improvised) moments from the cast."
378,the-song-of-sparrows-movie,Stephen Holden,80,"Although The Song of Sparrows has some of the trappings of a naturalistic drama, it is really a series of strict moral lessons pieced together into an austere Islamic sermon."
379,simply-irresistible-movie,Mary Elizabeth Williams,30,"When the enchanted crab is the most appealing character in a movie, you know you're in some serious metaphoric hot water."
380,irrational-man-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,Irrational Man is so clumsily staged and lethargically paced that it makes such clunkers as “Small Time Crooks” and “Cassandra’s Dream” look like minor classics.
381,valentin-movie,Richard Schickel,30,"Agresti's just out to give us a sentimental good time. Which some people, heaven help us, will have -- while the rest of us choke on the cutesiness."
382,savage-grace-movie,David Edelstein,70,"Howard A. Rodman's script has a lot of juice, and the rhythms are so pregnant that the air vibrates with something, even if you're not sure what."
383,just-married-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Even in the month of January, traditionally a time for movie lovers to expect the worst, this cheapo feature, directed by Shawn Levy, takes the stale cake for witlessness."
384,amores-perros-movie,Kevin Maynard,80,"Though unflinching in its savagery, Amores Perros is always compulsive viewing."
385,black-hawk-down-movie,Staff (Not credited),100,"Scott superbly re-creates the sense of individuals facing astounding odds, with barely a few minutes' respite over a 12-hour battle."
386,show-dogs-movie,Christy Lemire,12,"Even by the low standards of this type of live-action, family friendly comedy, Show Dogs is especially lame. It’s actually kind of amazing that it’s getting a theatrical release at all."
387,thirteen-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,"Unlike most other teen cautionary tales, Thirteen does not accuse merely one villain for the corruption of a minor."
388,the-piano-teacher-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,75,"The audience for this grimly disquieting film is, or ought to be, self-selecting."
389,mile-22-movie,Ryan Oliver,16,A laughably bad film.
390,who-do-you-love-movie,Nick Pinkerton,10,Goes from awful to insufferable.
391,the-three-burials-of-melquiades-estrada-movie,Sean Axmaker,100,"Tommy Lee Jones steps behind the camera to direct himself in the most impressive directorial debut the American cinema has seen in some time, a contemporary western both rough and poetic, laconic and passionate."
392,something-borrowed-movie,Peter Travers,12,The half-star rating goes to John Krasinski for heroically rising above this vile dung heap of a movie. 
393,the-tale-of-the-princess-kaguya-movie,Peter Rainer,100,"This delicate, hand-drawn marvel is lyrical and heartbreaking in ways that most live-action movies never approach."
394,the-astronauts-wife-movie,Kevin Maynard,20,"Houston, we have a problem.  It's called The Astronaut's Wife and it's an utterly predictable rip-off of classic '60s and '70s exercises in paranoia, from ""Rosemary's Baby"" to ""The Parallax View."""
395,closer-movie,Richard Corliss,90,"Funny, hurtful, splendidly acted."
396,the-wings-of-the-dove-movie,Alex Ross,0,"The movie is a modern facsimile of the potboilers James transfigured. A great movie may yet be made of James, but it will have to be done by someone who has read him."
397,tangerine-movie,David Edelstein,90,"What’s extraordinary about Tangerine is that it’s everything an entertaining, old-fashioned, mainstream Hollywood comedy should be but no longer is. That nowadays you have to get this kind of stuff via Sundance from directors using iPhones is a drag — the wrong kind. "
398,the-gleaners-i-movie,David Sterritt,100,"A fascinating nonfiction voyage into rural and urban France, focusing on idiosyncratic individuals who live off things the rest of us throw away, from food to furniture."
399,white-house-down-movie,Richard Roeper,0,"[A] cartoonish, offensive, overblown, clanging, steaming piece of ... cinema."
400,the-bank-movie,Jon Strickland,70,"Like ""Wall Street"" before it, The Bank never amounts to more than a glossy comic book, and first-time writer-director Robert Connolly stumbles with his plotting and his direction of Wenham."
401,walt-el-grupo-movie,Andrea Gronvall,70,There's a trove of movie lore in this absorbing documentary.
402,marvins-room-movie,Eric Brace,10,"Keaton and DiCaprio manage to bring several levels of emotion to their characters, but everyone else is a cardboard cut-out."
403,alexander-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"Vast, riveting, madly audacious movie biography."
404,hamlet-2000-movie,Dakota Smith,80,"New York City has never looked so slick and shallow as it does in Hamlet, an innovative, contemporary adaptation."
405,the-adventures-of-ford-fairlane-movie,Janet Maslin,10,"Renny Harlin, who did a much better job directing ''Die Hard 2,'' displays no sense of humor and takes the film's nonsensical action scenes much too seriously, at one point even blowing up a beach house in the process."
406,captain-america-civil-war-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"This very crowded, reasonably enjoyable installment in the Avengers cycle...reveals, even more than its predecessors, an essential truth about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s not so much a grand science-fiction saga, or even a series of action-adventure movies, as a very expensive, perpetually renewed workplace sitcom."
407,la-confidential-movie,Wendy Wilson,100,Blessed substance marries beautiful style in a '90s film noir.
408,transcendence-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,The real trouble with Transcendence is that it just isn’t all that scary — at least not in the way that it wants to be.
409,the-school-of-flesh-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"Once again, as love dies and illusions crumble, this natural actress (Isabelle Huppert) shines with human fire.  [26 March 1999, Friday, p.B]"
410,mrs-winterbourne-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"With Lake at the center, something that could have been innocuous becomes painful, and a sure shot at mediocrity is transformed into one of the worst films of the year."
411,the-glass-house-movie,Kevin Thomas,10,So laughably awful that it begs to have stones thrown at it; it's a wonder it got made at all.
412,miami-vice-movie,Peter Travers,88,"If you're looking for a crime story that sizzles with action, sex and the visceral jolt of life on the edge, Miami Vice is the one."
413,tristram-shandy-a-cock-and-bull-story-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,70,"This farce eventually runs out of steam, devolving into a protracted docudrama about actor Steve Coogan (who plays the title hero as well as his father), but until then this is a pretty clever piece of jive."
414,salmon-fishing-in-the-yemen-2012-movie,Michelle Orange,70,"When the recessive style works with the characters and the kooky international-incident story, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen has an absorbing, old-fashioned sweetness."
415,les-cowboys-movie,Steve Macfarlane,12,"Never content to suffice as a mediocre thriller, Les Cowboys is a wellspring of embarrassment for all parties involved."
416,dream-house-2011-movie,Marc Savlov,20,"Dream House is neither haunting (as the marketing appears to promise) nor all that original. But it does, thank goodness for small favors, have Elias Koteas."
417,book-club-movie,Moira Macdonald,63,"Book Club is very silly and feather-light, but let me say this: Spending time with this quartet is way more fun than reading “Fifty Shades of Grey.”"
418,life-during-wartime-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Charlotte Rampling goes for broke as a sexually rapacious older woman. So does Ally Sheedy as a rich woman. They're memorable, and yet equally satisfying is Ciaran Hinds' sadness and restraint as a paroled sex offender with deviancy in the blood."
419,teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-movie,Leonard Klady,30,"The music is overbearing, the camera and lighting too bright and obvious, and the production design borders on the cheesy. Performances range from competent to just plain embarrassing."
420,ca-commence-aujourdhui-movie,Derek Elley,90,"A warm, often invigorating and ultimately moving ode to community values."
421,righteous-kill-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,"It's not much fun to see these two reduced to ""Mad TV"" parodies of themselves."
422,insidious-the-last-key-movie,Henry Stewart,25,"The fourth film in the Insidious franchise, directed by Adam Robitel, is lazy and sometimes even loathsome."
423,the-hours-movie,William Arnold,83,"Kidman's Virginia Woolf is already controversial -- Yet there's something fierce, noble and deeply affecting in her work that mirrors Woolf's prose style, and her turbulent presence is the soul of the movie."
424,everly-movie,Sara Stewart,0,"This is nothing but nasty, misogynist torture porn."
425,the-belko-experiment-movie,Robert Abele,30,"The meager tension generated by characters discovering their survival instincts, and why you might not want to be next to them when they do, is quickly dissipated by the realization that, at a certain point, the movie is an assembly line of killing, and not a terribly exciting or entertaining one at that."
426,breaking-away-movie,Jay Scott,100,"One of the best, funniest, most surprising and likeable American films of the year. [27 Aug 1979]"
427,rabin-the-last-day-movie,Deborah Young,70,"It is unsettling in its depiction of the dark underbelly of the country, where a culture of hate paved the way for violence and tragedy. "
428,jeepers-creepers-ii-movie,Steven Rea,38,"This low-budget, high-gore sequel can be effectively frightening at times, and just plain boring, too. The suspense builds, the blood gushes, the momentum dissipates. It's an unsatisfying mix."
429,the-stepford-wives-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,20,Misbegotten is the only way to describe this remake of the 1975 film based on Ira Levin's cultural-zeitgeist novel.
430,alis-wedding-movie,Harry Windsor,80,"Following a thoroughly predictable rom-com template to thoroughly satisfying effect in a manner rarely seen in Australian cinema since Strictly Ballroom, Ali's Wedding hits all the beats while deftly capturing the tensions of the first-generation immigrant, torn between the norms of the country he calls home and those espoused by his family."
431,dumb-and-dumberer-when-harry-met-lloyd-movie,Claudia Puig,25,"In ""There's Something About Mary,"" the gross gags were hilarious. Here, they're just vile."
432,ballistic-ecks-vs-sever-movie,Keith Phipps,20,"Looks like a video-game promo, has a story that plays like the fifth episode of a struggling syndicated action show, and feels like a headache waiting to happen."
433,vice-2015-movie,Clayton Dillard,12,Vice takes the basic premise from 1973's Westworld and morphs it into an incoherent slog.
434,the-fantastic-four-movie,Steve Persall,25,Fantastic Four is so mediocre that its title seems like a violation of truth in advertising laws.
435,james-camerons-deepsea-challenge-3d-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,30,"James Cameron upstages the ocean in Deepsea Challenge 3D, a shallow vanity project that invites us to join him in marveling at his own daring."
436,ballistic-ecks-vs-sever-movie,Robert Koehler,20,"Remote, non-involving and finally incomprehensible."
437,fair-game-movie,Hal Hinson,10,"The movie is fast, slick and dumb as a post."
438,an-inconvenient-truth-movie,Phil Hall,0,An Inconvenient Truth is something you rarely see in movies today: a blatant intellectual fraud. Shame on all of the people involved in this travesty.
439,in-bloom-movie,Peter Keough,88,"Despite the seeming inevitability of tragedy and despair, In Bloom remains true to its title. Though political and personal upheaval threatens to overwhelm them, Eka and Natia’s clarity and courage resist the ignorance, injustice, and rage all around. "
440,revolver-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"The problem with Revolver is that it is Ritchie's first attempt at a ''serious'' look at the underworld, but the result is so pretentious and muddled it's almost a little embarrassing."
441,first-reformed-movie,Ian Freer,80,"Schrader’s best in yonks, a powerful meditation on faith’s place in the modern world. Hawke, as a kind of Travis Bickle in a dog collar, gives one of the performances of the year."
442,the-white-countess-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"Fiennes and Richardson make this film work with the quiet strangeness of their performances; if they insist on their eccentricities, it's because they've paid them off and own them outright."
443,abduction-movie,Todd Gilchrist,10,"The new film Abduction has a lot of problems, but the biggest is the fact that no one gets abducted. Ever. "
444,jaws-movie,A.D. Murphy,100,"Robert Shaw [is] absolutely magnificent as a coarse fisherman finally hired to locate the Great White Shark; and Richard Dreyfuss, in another excellent characterization as a likeable young scientist."
445,tammy-movie,Ann Hornaday,0,"Tammy is a bummer, not least because McCarthy’s fans know she’s better than this."
446,ride-with-the-devil-movie,Peter Stack,75,"For fans of Westerns, the film may have particular appeal. Its period gear and garb and galloping horses are major attractions"
447,max-movie,Jami Bernard,38,A serious and thoughtful movie that probably does not mean to trivialize the Holocaust and blame the victim. But it is playing with fire nevertheless.
448,pompeii-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,It’s impossible to find anything that grabs you in Pompeii. This lumpen adventure with a misguided romance buries anything in the disaster-flick genre that might have been a blast.
449,skyscraper-movie,Christy Lemire,63,"Just intense enough to provide a much-needed diversion, just lightweight enough to make you forget about it soon after it’s over. It’s not exactly “good,” per se, but it does what it sets out to do in terms of putting us on edge, which makes it … successful? "
450,off-the-map-movie,David Sterritt,100,"Scott has the courage to let the imaginative story unfold at its own leisurely pace, and it's not surprising that the acting is excellent, considering that he's among the very best American screen actors."
451,on-body-and-soul-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"Like the best of dreams, familiar yet wondrously different, On Body and Soul adroitly mixes recognizable cinematic tropes with extraordinary ideas that are very much the filmmaker's own."
452,the-internets-own-boy-the-story-of-aaron-swartz-movie,Richard Roeper,100,"This is a film that left me marveling at Swartz’s beautiful mind, and shaking my head at the insanity of the system he knew was badly fractured."
453,the-do-over-movie,Brian Tallerico,12,"Almost every female character is there to be screwed or to screw the guys over. Or both. This is how Sandler’s brand has always portrayed their female characters, but it’s just increasingly depressing. "
454,basic-movie,Ed Park,10,"Such confusion makes the script-flipping finale something of a respite, as it gives one an excuse to forget everything that's happened. "
455,mute-movie,David Sims,15,"Mute is a slog, and a depressing one; as Netflix sci-fi goes, it’s not as abjectly inept as The Cloverfield Paradox, but it’s perhaps even more disappointing given the talented filmmaker involved."
456,signs-movie,Steven Rea,75,"Signs is about God and family, too, but it's also about scaring the bejesus out of you --  and on that level it works like a miracle."
457,man-on-the-moon-movie,David Sterritt,100,"Less a biography than an essay on theatrical illusion and the changing nature of comedy. Love it or hate it, you've never seen anything quite like it."
458,a-christmas-carol-movie,Betsy Sharkey,30,"What are in very short supply, though, are the central chords of Dickens' carol: Crachit's generous spirit, Tiny Tim's sad plight, Scrooge's emotional arc as he finds his humanity. Oh, the scenes are there amid the action, but they are fleeting. By the time A Christmas Carol finishes piling its many shiny presents with their many bells and whistles under the tree, there's no room left for tears for Tiny Tim. Bah humbug indeed."
459,journey-to-the-center-of-the-earth-movie,Ty Burr,63,"For a harmless ""Indiana Jones"" knock-off, Journey to the Center of the Earth has an awful lot riding on it."
460,accidental-love-movie,Scott Foundas,30,"The disparate tones never gel, and the movie has an airless, stop-and-go feel, as if a studio-audience laugh track were intended but never inserted. "
461,personal-shopper-movie,Peter Sobczynski,100,"They (Assayas/Stewart) have managed to out-do themselves with a work as mysterious, moving and haunting as anything that has materialized in a movie theater in a while. "
462,is-that-a-gun-in-your-pocket-movie,Chris Packham,0,The film combines agonizing scenes of didactic earnestness about gun violence with the absolutely soul-crushing ennui of flaccid marriage jokes.
463,adventureland-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"Mottola also wrote the screenplay, which is most fresh and honest when dealing with supporting characters."
464,the-master-of-disguise-movie,James Berardinelli,12,"Even the rare individual who died laughing while watching the trailer will discover that only half of that phrase - the ""dying"" part - applies to the experience of enduring the film."
465,raise-your-voice-movie,Leah McLaren,25,"The film suffers from a syndrome I'll call the Pop Princess's New Clothes. Hilary can't really sing, and neither can Terri, so you can't help but wonder, what's the big whoop? "
466,walking-with-dinosaurs-3d-movie,Tom Russo,38,"However well-intentioned the movie may be, it spills over with flat cutesy humor, making a slog out of an experience that should be filled with wonder."
467,the-time-travelers-wife-movie,Peter Rainer,16,"They miss by a mile – or should I say, a light-year."
468,horrible-bosses-movie,Nathan Rabin,75,"In the film's funniest scene, a coked-up Day rocks out to The Ting Tings' ""That's Not My Name"" in a car in a state of ecstatic frenzy. "
469,ice-age-the-meltdown-movie,Peter Debruge,63,Features the lamest story of any CG-animated feature to date.
470,the-clan-movie,Zhuo-Ning Su,83,"It’s true that none of this is particularly groundbreaking and that, as hinted above, the limitations of a biographical film are still palpable towards the end, but the pure, visceral satisfaction of seeing an exciting story expertly told cannot be denied either."
471,the-love-guru-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"The Love Guru”does not bring out Myer's best,  and aside from a deft early Bollywood parody, there’s nothing visually to help the fun along."
472,a-cure-for-wellness-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,A godawful gothic horror flick.
473,law-abiding-citizen-movie,Richard Corliss,30,"Butler has the showier part, but his impersonation of the tragic hero is undercut by his weird resemblance to Soupy Sales. You start hoping that Shelton will kill somebody with a custard (or puffer-fish) pie to the face."
474,cars-movie,Shawn Levy,83,There's so much to impress and delight you that the time flies by.
475,one-for-the-money-movie,Peter Travers,0,"Everything in One for the Money rings cringingly false, from Heigl's absurd Snooki accent to Plum's romance with Joe Morelli, an Italian cop, played by – faith and begorrah – Jason O'Mara. To dismiss Julie Anne Robinson's direction as clueless would be a kindness."
476,nowhere-in-africa-movie,David Sterritt,75,"If lush landscapes and exotic wildlife are what you're after, this isn't the safari for you. But many moviegoers will respond to its mixture of family drama and Holocaust-era history."
477,slow-west-movie,Justin Chang,80,"John Maclean’s impeccably crafted writing-directing debut at times has a distinctly Coen-esque flavor in its mix of sly intelligence, bleak humor and unsettling violence, exuding fierce confidence even when these qualities don’t always cohere in the smoothest or most emotionally impactful fashion. "
478,gods-own-country-movie,David Rooney,90,"Graced by its refreshingly frank treatment of gay sexuality, its casually expressive use of nudity, and its eloquent depiction of animal husbandry as a contrasting metaphor for the absence of human tenderness, this is a rigorously naturalistic drama that yields stirring performances from the collision between taciturn demeanors and roiling emotional undercurrents."
479,hedwig-and-the-angry-inch-movie,Ernest Hardy,100,"Mitchell retools his play magnificently, opening it up into a vibrant cinematic work."
480,palindromes-movie,Ken Tucker,30,"Mostly stiff acting and intentionally flat, banal dialogue."
481,hidden-movie,Peter Rainer,83,This is the most Hitchcockian of Haneke's films. A seemingly well-adjusted man in a well ordered universe is brought to the brink.
482,edge-of-tomorrow-movie,Drew McWeeny,91,"The reason the film works is because it throws everything into the blender and comes up with something new, something that has a great lively sense of wit and humor to it, and it takes the time to fully explore its wild premise fully."
483,mchales-navy-movie,Steven Rea,12,"If the '60s sitcom McHale's Navy was a poor man's Sergeant Bilko, the new big-screen McHale is a poverty-stricken, starving-to-death, brain-dead person's answer to last year's not-so-hot Steve Martin movie, Sgt. Bilko. [19 Apr 1997, p.D08]"
484,birdman-or-the-unexpected-virtue-of-ignorance-movie,Jessica Kiang,100,It’s borderline miraculous.
485,faceoff-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"A provocative premise, virtuoso direction and two dazzling lead performances go a long way toward offsetting a lack of dramatic structure and a sense of when to quit in Face/Off."
486,batman-robin-movie,Keith Phipps,10,"Clooney fails to make much of an impression as The Batman, but to make an impression amongst all the garish theatrics, he would pretty much have to shout his dialogue in rhyming verse, backwards."
487,field-of-dreams-movie,Peter Travers,12,"To be honest, I started hearing things, too. Just when Jones was delivering an inexcusably sappy speech about baseball being ""a symbol of all that was once good in America,"" I heard the words ""If he keeps talking, I'm walking."""
488,dominion-prequel-to-the-exorcist-movie,David Sterritt,100,"The material is right up Schrader's alley, and while his vision of the first ""Exorcist"" chapter isn't a masterpiece, it's far superior to the Renny Harlin prequel to ""The Exorcist"" released last year."
489,corpse-bride-movie,Teresa Wiltz,70,"For all its charm, we can't quite figure out for whom the film is intended: Talking maggots and decaying bodies do not a kiddie movie make."
490,wont-you-be-my-neighbor-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"Without undue fawning, Neville’s moving portrait does a lovely job of presenting Rogers as two people, the public figure and the private one, sharing the same closet full of zip-up sweaters."
491,a-league-of-their-own-movie,Jay Carr,88,"A League of Their Own may not boost its material into the level of pop myth as, say, last year's great female buddy movie, ""Thelma & Louise,"" did. It's a bit too concerned with being likable to make that kind of bold leap. But if A League of Their Own doesn't knock the ball out of the park, it's a clean hit, with extra bases written all over it. [1 July 1992, p.41]"
492,fifty-dead-men-walking-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"Sharp, well-acted film."
493,the-final-project-movie,Brian Tallerico,12,"Worst of all, nothing in The Final Project has any personality."
494,siberia-movie,Rex Reed,25,"Everything is tenuous, including a performance by Keanu Reeves that borders on catatonia. Just because he stopped shaving doesn’t mean he can suddenly act."
495,searching-for-sugar-man-movie,Mike Scott,100,"All music docs are not created equal. Yes, some are formulaic. But some are beautiful, some are singular, some are marvels of storytelling. And some, like Searching for Sugar Man, are all three."
496,the-jacket-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"If claustrophobia's your style, The Jacket is a perfect fit."
497,dumb-and-dumberer-when-harry-met-lloyd-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"I wouldn't want you to consider even renting this thing. It would only encourage another prequel, this time featuring two dumb toddlers who keep walking into doors and become great pals. Call it ""Duh and Duh."""
498,collateral-damage-movie,Peter Travers,10,Abort! Abort! It's that time of year when Hollywood releases movies it should never have made in the first place.
499,miracles-from-heaven-movie,Barry Hertz,25,Miracles from Heaven is mostly an embarrassment.
500,fast-times-at-ridgemont-high-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,100,"Perfectly capturing the zeitgeist of American high school life in the '80s, complete with a Rubik's cube reference, the funny and occasionally harsh Fast Times, with all due apologies to John Hughes and Mickey Rooney, may be the greatest teen movie ever made (even though Cates was the only real teen)."
501,the-lady-and-the-duke-movie,Jami Bernard,75,The result is a galvanizing mix of intellectual discourse and guillotined heads.
502,i-hate-valentines-day-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,An unspeakable nadir in the career of its writer-director-star.
503,perfect-sense-movie,Rex Reed,25,"And there is Ewan McGregor, who makes entirely too many movies and only occasionally makes an effort to speak the kind of English anyone can understand. "
504,rock-of-ages-movie,Rex Reed,0,"I haven't seen a movie this bad since ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""Howard the Duck."""
505,the-color-of-time-movie,Rex Reed,0,The movie sinks without a trace.
506,warcraft-movie,Christy Lemire,12,"I’m also hoping that the game is more emotionally engaging — or at least, you know, fun — than the movie I just saw. Because that thing was a dour mess."
507,all-about-steve-movie,Kyle Smith,0,Grotesquely unfunny comedy.
508,diana-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,16,"A thoroughly dull, conventional tale of two people who can't find a compromise on their individual priorities to be together."
509,the-gatekeepers-movie,Roger Moore,88,"Using archival footage, inventive animated recreations of incidents and chilling aerial smart-bomb views of air strikes as they happen, Moreh creates a simple yet elegantly damning film."
510,the-letters-movie,Clayton Dillard,12,A brain-dead slog whose bankrupt aesthetics ironically soil the very legacy it purports to aggrandize.
511,the-great-gatsby-movie,Lawrence Toppman,83,"Now comes director Baz Luhrmann, who’s incapable of taking anything literally, and what do we get? The “Gatsby” that, of three I’ve seen and two I’ve read about, seems most faithful to the spirit of Fitzgerald’s superbly sad book. His audacity pays off in a way that may not exactly reproduce the novel but continually illuminates it."
512,the-kite-runner-movie,Jack Mathews,63,"This is an eye-opening story that doesn't quite hold together as a movie, but it deals with honor in men's lives in ways rare to mainstream film."
513,tarzan-the-ape-man-movie,Gary Arnold,10,"Unfortunately, all too many paying customers will remember being suckered into the Derek remake of ""Tarzan,"" which shortchanges every feature susceptible moviegoers must assume they'll find: tongue-in-cheek romance, exotic high adventure and generous scrutiny of Bo in the buff. Denying people the forms of amusement, notably erotic amusement, that the publicity suggests, Derek exposes a truly dangerous ineptitude."
514,remember-movie,Roger Moore,75,"The mystery, the great cast and the slow simmer of tension that Egoyan builds into Remember recommend it. The third act payoff won’t be to every taste. Egoyan is the Canadian Spike Lee in that regard."
515,trumbo-movie,Ken Fox,88,"Peter Askin's powerful documentary serves as an important reminder of our First Amendment rights, and a tribute to one man who fought to preserve them in the face of Congressional intimidation."
516,4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,100,"Despite their terrible ordeal these women are heroes, not victims. As Mungiu makes clear in the casual, brilliant final scene of this amazing movie, heroes persevere."
517,mission-impossible-5-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,100,"McQuarrie understands that these films are essentially tall tales with a sense of humor, skating on the edge of parody at all times while maintaining a poker face."
518,proof-movie,Nelson Pressley,70,"Paltrow is pretty commanding, even if Madden pushes things toward airlessness by keeping the camera so tight."
519,old-dogs-movie,James Berardinelli,12,What's wrong with this movie? A better question might be: What's right? Every attempt at comedy is not only obvious but delivered in such a forced manner that any hope of generating laughter dies before the joke has been told.
520,prime-movie,William Arnold,25,It has the low-budget look and feel of an indie dating comedy -- and not a very good one at that.
521,searching-for-bobby-fischer-movie,Jay Carr,88,"The story line is not what carries this picture. Pomeranc carries it, with his gentleness, taciturnity and wise eyes. Whether throwing an easy match just to see what will happen if he loses, or looking infinitely sad and worldly as he contemplates the folly of a narrow-focus opponent, Pomeranc makes the linking of a moral intelligence to a chess intelligence the most exhilarating and touching sports combo at the movies this year. [11 Aug 1993, p.29]"
522,va-savoir-who-knows-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"On a Paris rooftop about an hour into this 2-hour film, the tone shifts and the atmosphere lightens into giddy farce."
523,gentlemen-broncos-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,"White is cast in this film as a “guardian angel” and adds another level of painful homosexual confusion and stereotyping to the film. Ultimately, all the chafing caused by Gentlemen Broncos is likely to leave you saddlesore."
524,rbg-movie,David Edelstein,70,Both the film and the “notorious” figure at its center are the best imaginable retaliation to mansplaining.
525,the-phantom-of-the-opera-movie,Nathan Rabin,30,"Adding an additional layer of cheese to a project that already reeks hopelessly of Velveeta, Schumacher pumps up the empty spectacle, stranding his fetching-but-lifeless mannequins amid giant sets and overblown production numbers."
526,the-new-guy-movie,Ann Hornaday,0,"A particularly loathsome piece of cultural detritus, a trashy, crass piece of work that panders to the anxieties and desires of adolescents without a scintilla of sympathy or coherence."
527,sounder-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Sounder is a story simply told and universally moving. It is one of the most compassionate and truthful of movies, and there's not a level where it doesn't succeed completely. "
528,american-casino-movie,Steven Rea,75,It's a scary tale.
529,tower-movie,Noel Murray,90,Maitland’s experimental approach to a tricky subject leaves viewers with a deeper understanding of a terrible moment in American history.
530,the-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-movie,Kyle Smith,63,"Wilkinson's reflective and regretful searcher, burdened by secrets, is also touching, as are Dench and Nighy's creations, so it's easy to cheer them on as they inch toward revelations and rebirth."
531,the-emperors-new-clothes-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"The blithely dishonest script would have us believe that the real Napoleon can't prove his identity when the fake Napoleon refuses to come clean. Not only is that patent nonsense, it's cockeyed dramaturgy."
532,barbershop-movie,Claudia Puig,63,Genial but largely predictable ensemble comedy.
533,precious-based-on-the-novel-push-by-sapphire-movie,Amy Biancolli,100,"A movie about an obese Harlem teenager who's raped by her father and abused by her mother. It's depressing, devastating, harrowing and repulsive. But there are lyric flights of hope interspersed among that raw naturalism, and that's what makes this movie amazing."
534,how-to-lose-friends-alienate-people-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,"The movie based on Young's 2002 memoir is a good bit blunter. One early laugh comes at the expense of a pig urinating on a woman's feet at the BAFTA awards, the British equivalent of the Oscars. And it doesn't get much better, or much smarter, than that."
535,inspector-clouseau-movie,Renata Adler,10,"A comedy so uninspired, so relentlessly awful that one occasionally laughs for it—more like a moo or a snort or a gagging noise—just to interrupt it a little or help it out of the room. "
536,good-morning-vietnam-movie,Barry Mcilheney,80,"One of Levinson's best films, and one of Hollywood's best films on the whole Vietnam subject."
537,narc-movie,Steven Rea,75,"Patric and Liotta get the chance to do some heavy riffing on themes of honor, sacrifice, selling out and self-destructing, and the bleak, smeared world of drugs and violence is brought to the fore with feverish style."
538,license-to-wed-movie,Marc Mohan,8,An atrocious Robin Williams vehicle that might be Hollywood's first anti-romantic comedy.
539,little-miss-sunshine-movie,Jack Mathews,75,"A charmer, a comedy with drama -- or vice versa."
540,5-star-day-movie,Robert Abele,30,"Frankly, it's hard to imagine even George Clooney making such ill-used screen minutes interesting. But the movie around those moments is even worse."
541,non-stop-2014-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,"Non-Stop is a crisp, efficient thriller that benefits greatly from the intangibles Neeson can be counted on to supply."
542,ghost-dog-the-way-of-the-samurai-movie,Ernest Hardy,90,"Laced with brilliantly knotted ideas on race, masculinity and cults of violence."
543,nostalgia-movie,Chuck Bowen,38,"Mark Pellington's Nostalgia is less a living, breathing film than a presentation of sentiments revolving around a pat question: Are the objects of our lives merely detritus, or are they vital to our identities? "
544,now-you-see-me-movie,William Goss,72,"The film itself is sly and smug in kind, fleetingly enjoyable for all of its old-school showmanship and high-tech hokiness. "
545,driven-movie,Mike Clark,25,A race-car drama full of flashy but empty images and a soundtrack that makes you feel as if you're being shaken on a motel rumblebed.
546,the-green-hornet-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"The film's only unqualified success is the end title sequence-because it's genuinely stylish, because it looks like it was shot in genuine 3-D and, most of all, because it's the end."
547,stronger-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,80,It’s a weird and unusually honest film.
548,starbuck-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,30,What begins as a cute idea grows annoyingly sentimental before it is through.

550,body-of-lies-movie,Ann Hornaday,70,"With its urgent post-9/11 context and often brutal violence, it seems off-key to describe Body of Lies as a nifty political thriller, but that's what it is."
551,light-it-up-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"As an actor, Raymond is whiny and annoying, but not nearly so much as the film."
552,the-yards-movie,Roger Ebert,75,It's that ambiguity that makes the film interesting.
553,enchanted-april-movie,Lloyd Sachs,75,"Walker finds an unexpected wit and depth in her character. [7 Aug 1992, p.38]"
554,gattaca-movie,Elvis Mitchell,90,A handsome and fully imagined work of cautionary futuristic fiction.
555,slackers-movie,Manohla Dargis,0,"Barely proficient on a craft level, this jumble of putatively comic misunderstanding and overly familiar crude burlesque achieves its nadir with a cameo from Mamie Van Doren, a degrading, shameful turn that lays bare, all too literally, the filmmakers' contempt for women."
556,reality-bites-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,"Ryder, good as she was in The Age of Innocence, gives her first true star performance here. Beneath her crisp, postfeminist manner, Lelaina is bristling with confusion, and Ryder lets you read every crosscurrent of temptation and anxiety, the way her tentative search for love slowly grows into a restless hunger. Yearning, hilarious, lost within their precocious self-awareness, these slackers have soul."
557,our-song-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,This modest film has virtues that come out of nowhere. It takes familiar material and develops it with such tact and skill that we find ourselves moved and sort of amazed at the same time.
558,breathe-movie,Scott Foundas,90,"Melanie Laurent brings a sure, sensitive hand to tonally tricky material and draws superb work from relative newcomers Josephine Japy (“Cloclo”) and Lou De Laage (“Jappeloup”)."

563,the-lego-batman-movie-movie,Peter Hartlaub,75,"The Lego Batman Movie is less awesome than its predecessor, but it’s a clever, well-paced, self-aware and completely satisfying kind of less awesome."
564,monster-house-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,"A grisly, often cynical piece of work whose joyless, aggressive spirit is made even less appealing by its soulless visual style."
565,the-whistleblower-movie,Kyle Smith,25,A pointless drama that trafficks in cliché.
566,wonderstruck-movie,Steve Macfarlane,63,"Todd Haynes's Wonderstruck is a coming-of-age tale as curiosity cabinet, a flowchart of narrative fragments that steadily build to a high-concept finale as ludicrous as it is emotionally audacious. "

570,observe-and-report-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"If you thought Abu Ghraib was a laugh riot then you might love Observe and Report, a potentially brilliant conceptual comedy that fizzles because its writer and director, Jody Hill, doesn't have the guts to go with his spleen."
571,3-12-minutes-10-bullets-movie,Duane Byrge,90,It’s sobering and heart-wrenching.
572,walking-with-dinosaurs-3d-movie,Roger Moore,63,"“Walking” takes care to ID each new dinosaur species introduced, including factoids about what they ate and any special skills they might have had. It’s downright educational. Just don’t tell your kids that."

578,brideshead-revisited-movie,Dennis Harvey,80,"Offers lush and compelling drama drawn from Evelyn Waugh's beloved novel. Purists may blanch at the screenplay's changes to the source material's narrative fine points, but its spirit survives intact."
579,rollerball-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"An incoherent mess, a jumble of footage in search of plot, meaning, rhythm and sense."
580,cinderella-man-movie,Desson Thomson,70,"What keeps ""Cinderella"" from complete hokiness is Crowe's utterly believable performance."
581,playing-the-field-movie,Eric Henderson,12,"Gabriele Muccino's film is knee-deep in ""don't hate the player, hate the game"" territory."
582,northfork-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"There is nothing quite like this movie, and I'm not altogether sure there is much more to it than its lovely peculiarity. But at a moment when so many films strive to be obvious and interchangeable as possible, it is gratifying to find one that is puzzling, subtle and handmade."
583,made-movie,Michael Sragow,38,Made is an amateur-hour buddy movie.
584,saving-silverman-movie,Wesley Morris,0,"The movie can barely muster the bravery to be even ""Dude, Where's My Car"" stoopid."
585,chill-factor-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,"If you're the kind of person who goes to the movies primarily to watch faces melt to pulp, you won't be disappointed."
586,gunner-palace-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"A nerve-jangling work of visual poetry and ironic juxtaposition, and a powerful human story of a group of brave young Americans."
587,little-nicky-movie,Lawrence Toppman,0,"Bad actors, bad music and bad plot make it a hellish bummer."
588,jimi-all-is-by-my-side-movie,Steven Rea,75,"That's something else Ridley and his actors do: make you appreciate what a life it was - impossibly short, impossibly brilliant."
589,the-bourne-ultimatum-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"This is the most satisfying thriller of the year, capping the Bourne trilogy."
590,the-innkeepers-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,"It works, both as a character study and a BOO! made-you-jump exercise in horror."
591,third-person-movie,Diane Garrett,30,"Third Person is an intricately constructed but unaffecting bore. Kinder people might call it an “interesting failure,” but to earn that label it would need to be interesting."
592,american-pie-movie,William Arnold,25,Idiotic.
593,set-it-up-movie,Kristen Yoonsoo Kim,70,While so many recent renditions of the rom-com have tried to upgrade the genre — usually by going the raunchy route — Set It Up feels so purposefully classic and familiar that it plays right into that nostalgic feel-good spot.
594,infamous-movie,David Rooney,70,Writer-director Douglas McGrath's boldest stroke is to impose a more overtly gay interpretation on a central relationship in which the attraction was generally supposed to be unspoken.
595,splice-movie,Ann Hornaday,0,"The yuck factor spins off the charts in Splice, a thoroughly repulsive science fiction-horror flick that slicks up its B-movie tawdriness with high-gloss production values and two otherwise classy stars."
596,rosemarys-baby-movie,Pauline Kael,100,"It's genuinely funny, yet it's also scary, especially for young women: it plays on their paranoid vulnerabilities... Mia Farrow is enchanting in her fragility: she's just about perfect for her role."
597,trolosa-movie,Desson Thomson,90,"What's best about Faithless is its honesty, its lack of desire to ingratiate itself with the audience."
598,notes-on-a-scandal-movie,David Denby,80,A wonderfully entertaining movie.
599,alexander-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"Can a series of irritating events make a movie? Yes, but an irritating one: Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day."
600,get-over-it-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,75,"A delightful and exuberant bit of romantic comedy and, as a bonus, it breathes new life into a pair of '70s musical chestnuts long off our culture's radar screens."
601,gone-in-sixty-seconds-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"One of the best of its streamlined, over-produced, double-clutch kind: a high-speed, slicker-than-slick car-chase movie with unexpected deposits of character and comedy."
602,the-merchant-of-venice-movie,David Edelstein,80,"This Merchant of Venice comes roaring to life--when it stops, in effect, apologizing for its terrible anti-Semitic worldview and just gives itself over to some of the most furious courtroom drama ever written."
603,jesus-son-movie,Other (Specify),80,"Has the edge of black comedy that defines Maclean's sensibility, but it also has a mature new sweetness. And it's certainly one of the best films about the life of an addict since ""Drugstore Cowboy."""
604,the-chumscrubber-movie,Peter Travers,25,"An appallingly clumsy and stupid take on drugs, kidnapping and suicide in suburbia."
605,a-man-called-ove-movie,Odie Henderson,88,"All movies are manipulative by default; the effectiveness of that manipulation is the more valid measurement to inspect. On that scale, A Man Called Ove is a morbidly funny and moving success."
606,garfield-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,38,Garfield the comic strip stopped being funny about 10 years ago. Garfield the Movie makes it to about the 10-minute mark before tedium sets in.
607,overlord-re-release-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"Like its hero, who is brave without a trace of bravado, Overlord is unusually quiet and thoughtful. The scale and ambition of combat movies has usually been epic, but this one is disarmingly lyrical and subjective."
608,nine-lives-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,70,"Five or six lives might have felt more concise; nine test the patience a bit, though it is impressive that each is composed of a single Steadicam shot."
609,for-colored-girls-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,30,"(Perry) style is too crude and stagy for Shange's transformative evocation of black female life, and his moralizing strikes exactly the wrong notes to express the pain and longing that cries out from her heated poetry."
610,hansel-and-gretel-witch-hunters-movie,Rex Reed,25,"In an age of zombies, werewolves and oversexed vampires, teens won't be shaking in their Uggs over ugly women with bad teeth flying around on brooms, and with its graphic depictions of tortures, mutilations, gang rapes and myriad examples of child abuse, it's no longer a fairy tale suitable for children."
611,autumn-blood-movie,Martin Tsai,30,"Whereas Haneke's films grapple with the blunt force of violence, novice filmmaker Markus Blunder just lets the violence snowball all the way down a slippery slope."
612,tokarev-movie,Nikola Grozdanovic,0,"Tired, lazy, incongruous, shocking and hilarious in all the wrong places, Rage is destined for the graveyard television slot, squeezed between infomercials for mops."

614,5x2-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"Feminist sanctimony, it turns out, looks much the same forward and backward."
615,you-were-never-really-here-movie,Giovanni Marchini Camia,100,"On the level of montage, You Were Never Really Here is an expressionistic tour de force."
616,the-babadook-movie,Sara Stewart,88,"The film’s slightly confusing ending doesn’t spell anything out, but that’s all right: We’re left sitting in the dark shivering, reassured there are still some directors who can leave us well and truly creeped out."
617,joe-dirt-movie,Robert Wilonsky,0,Sandler and Spade continue their avid quest to dumb down America.
618,mothers-day-2016-movie,David Ehrlich,0,"Lifeless, ugly, and vaguely evil in its gross attempt to offer something for everyone, Mother's Day doesn't feel like a movie so much as it does a cinematic adaptation of Walmart. "
619,identity-thief-movie,Dana Stevens,30,It would be easier to forgive Identity Thief its overfamiliar comic setups and shameless gag-recycling if the movie’s second half didn’t make such an abrupt about-face from soliciting our revulsion to begging for our pity. 
620,i-declare-war-movie,Steve Davis,67,"In the end, I Declare War is both enthralling and a little frustrating in its refusal to fit neatly in any box. Its unpredictable tone clicks back and forth between the comical and the serious like the safety catch on a firearm. "
621,the-adventures-of-rocky-bullwinkle-movie,Joe Leydon,10,"Scarcely seems worth the expenditure of time, money and talent."
622,skyline-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"Visual-effects wizards Greg and Colin Strause directed, showing more affinity for the city's steel and glass than for any of the characters. "
623,groundhog-day-movie,Staff (Not Credited),70,"Seeing it once is fine, but seeing it every day for the rest of your life is not recommended."
624,the-theory-of-everything-movie,Peter Travers,88,"The Theory of Everything, referring to Hawking's dream of finding an equation to explain all existence, is riveting science, emotional provocation and one-of-a-kind love story all rolled into one triumphant film."
625,kill-me-three-times-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,"Although Kill Me Three Times includes a few murders, it does nothing to justify its title. Mostly, it just shoots itself in the foot, over and over."
626,12-movie,Michelle Orange,90,"Miklahkov keeps 12 tops spinning at all times in the school gymnasium that serves as their deliberation room, and though the speech/conversion pattern grows a little pat, the movement toward consensus raises the further, richly complicated question of how to decide not only what is right, but what is best."
627,hillarys-america-the-secret-history-of-the-democratic-party-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,10,"D’Souza might be preaching to the choir, but at least this voter recruitment tool could have aspired to something more challenging than an amateurishly slapped-together rehash."
628,tape-movie,Jay Carr,88,"Smart, unpredictable, and alive with the energies of actors who clearly are enjoying being stretched by their material."
629,crude-movie,Steven Rea,88,"What's less clear, and more maddening, is how several generations of Ecuadorans have been left to live on toxic land, their health and livelihoods compromised, while lawyers file motions and counter-motions and blame is passed around."
630,happiness-runs-movie,Gary Goldstein,10,An astoundingly bad memory piece that blows its potential dramatic heft at every turn.
631,johnny-suede-movie,Jeff Dawson,80,"Offbeat, stylish and packed with some wonderfully bizarro moments."
632,the-wolf-of-wall-street-movie,Ann Hornaday,63,"The Wolf of Wall Street remains one-note even at is most outré, an episodic portrait of rapaciousness in which decadence escalates into debauchery escalates into depravity — but, miraculously, not death."
633,lauberge-espagnole-movie,Charles Taylor,30,"Klapisch wants his characters shiny bright, and winds up making them excruciatingly dull in the process. Watching L'Auberge Espagnole is like seeing the young Maoist revolutionaries of Jean-Luc Godard's 1967 ""La Chinoise"" body-snatched by the international touring company of ""Up With People."""
634,underclassman-movie,Bill White,0,The inconsistencies and continuity errors are staggering.
635,with-all-deliberate-speed-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,70,"Gets most of its juice from listening to groups of people who were students and activists in segregated Clarendon County, S.C., and Prince Edward County, Va., during the years leading up to the case."
636,the-divergent-series-allegiantpart-1-movie,Soren Andersen,38,"All of it feels warmed over, reprocessed … and, yes, confused."
637,did-you-hear-about-the-morgans-movie,Joe Williams,38,"Given the creator and the cast, ""Morgans"" is as drearily predictable as a plague of locusts."
638,precious-based-on-the-novel-push-by-sapphire-movie,Bob Mondello,90,Its story ends up packing an emotional wallop as substantial as its title character.
639,our-brand-is-crisis-2015-movie,Peter Debruge,70,"As played by Sandra Bullock, Our Brand Is Crisis political spin doctor Jane Bodine is easily one of the best female roles of the last 10 years."

641,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,Edward Guthmann,0,Worse than dull. It's parasitic.
642,starbuck-movie,Tomas Hachard,38,Yet another example of modern-family predicaments getting stuffed into the traditional-family-values message of conventional comedies.
643,passing-strange-movie,Scott Foundas,90,"Passing Strange conjures a rare kind of theatrical magic with its emotionally raw, frequently euphoric portrait of the artist as a young man."
644,the-ballad-of-jack-and-rose-movie,M. E. Russell,83,"Daniel Day-Lewis may be one of our great actors, but he trips over a few Method-acting speed bumps in wife Rebecca Miller's third writer-director effort."
645,broken-horses-movie,Sara Stewart,38,"The bloodshed is artful, at least."
646,the-truman-show-movie,Graham Verdon,100,"An exhilarating, fascinating story about the amazing and horrifying depth we are sinking toward as we strain to raise the entertainment bar another notch."
647,pulling-strings-movie,Mark Olsen,70,"Serving mostly as a strong calling card for star Jaime Camil, the film has an appealingly loose, slightly ramshackle charm."
648,get-hard-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"Beyond a leper’s handful of jokes that actually connect, this might as well be Ferrell’s most abysmal piece of work since the disastrous ""Land of the Lost."""
649,cymbeline-movie,Keith Uhlich,91,"Almereyda tackles one of the Bard’s lesser-regarded later works, the plot-heavy tragicomedy Cymbeline, and again unearths untold depths."
650,eves-bayou-movie,Emanuel Levy,90,"Anchored by a strong cast, including Samuel L. Jackson (also credited as a producer), Lynn Whitfield and Diahann Carroll, this talented debut by a black female writer-director is a well-made, if also old-fashioned, multi-generational drama."
651,did-you-hear-about-the-morgans-movie,Joe Neumaier,10,"The loping pace, inconsistent tone and lack of imagination are all deadly."
652,my-best-friend-movie,Robert Koehler,70,Well-turned adult comedy.
653,vegas-vacation-movie,Lawrence Van Gelder,10,"Throughout this lame film, directed by Stephen Kessler and written by Elisa Bell, situations are developed -- complicated directions to a hotel room, Clark clinging to the face of Hoover Dam, Ellen the object of Mr. Newton's seductive charm -- and left to wither without a payoff."
654,the-salesman-movie,Mike D'Angelo,83,"""Death Of A Salesman"" does indeed figure into the story, as the film’s main characters, a married couple, are playing Willy and Linda Loman in an amateur production. On the whole, however, this starkly confrontational melodrama has more in common with the Charles Bronson classic ""Death Wish,"" even if it’s angry words rather than bullets that go whizzing across the screen. "
655,bird-movie,Jay Scott,75,"At two hours and 43 minutes, Eastwood's Bird is a hypnotic, darkly photographed, loosely constructed marvel that avoids every cliche of the self-destructive-celebrity biography, a particularly remarkable achievement in that Parker played out every cliche of the self- destructive-celebrity life. [14 Oct 1988, p. C1]"
656,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"There's nothing scarier than a group of hormone-crazed 20-somethings, but this sequel isn't much more than a footnote of a footnote."
657,into-the-storm-movie,Marc Mohan,25,"If the film had been trimmed to 45 minutes of crazed storm-chasing and storm-fleeing, it might've been worth a matinee ticket. But as is, it's the sort of lazy late-summer idiocy you'd be wise to huddle beneath an overpass to avoid."
658,california-typewriter-movie,Brad Wheeler,100,"There's a certain nostalgia at work here, but where the film really clicks is on the subject of the creative process and as a meditation on the human-machine dynamic. "
659,happy-go-lucky-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,100,"Leigh and his actors work mysterious magic in Happy-Go-Lucky. This is a movie about hitting the groove of everyday life and, nearly miraculously, getting music out of it."
660,the-manchurian-candidate-movie,John Powers,80,"If Demme's version lacks the wallop of its predecessor, it is more likely to be popular with contemporary audiences, who will enjoy not only its labyrinthine twists but its stars' burnished professionalism."
661,tell-no-one-movie,Steven Rea,88,"A terrific mystery, equal parts haunting love story and nimble thriller."
662,the-changeling-1980-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"It doesn't have that sneaky sense of awful things about to happen. Scott makes the hero so rational, normal and self-possessed that we never feel he's in real danger; we go through this movie with too much confidence."
663,lady-chatterley-movie,Peter Travers,88,It's a movie as timely as it is thrilling to watch.
664,princesa-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,A sympathetic look at what it's like to be a Brazilian transsexual prostitute working in Milan.
665,black-snake-moan-movie,Peter Rainer,25,"Maybe Jackson should avoid any more movies with ""snake"" in the title."
666,broken-embraces-movie,A.O. Scott,90,"Broken Embraces leaves the viewer in a contradictory state, a mixture of devastation and euphoria, amusement and dismay that deserves its own clinical designation. Call it Almodóvaria, a syndrome from which some of us are more than happy to suffer."
667,no-stranger-than-love-movie,Leslie Felperin,30,"It’s not a problem there’s a hole, as it were, in the common-sense logic of the film’s world; it’s that there’s a big, gaping hole where the illogic should be, a whole lot of nothing where there should be metaphor, playfulness, all that juicy, enigmatic, magical-realism stuff that helps films like Being John Malkovich and its many knockoffs become fodder for film-studies essays."
668,independence-day-resurgence-movie,Barry Hertz,0,"One of the most aggressively stupid blockbusters ever made, a painful exercise in Hollywood greed and artistic incompetence on every level."
669,back-to-the-future-part-iii-movie,Julie Salamon,10,"Doc says: ""I can't believe this is happening."" …That sentence may be the only one uttered in the entire film that contains an ounce of true feeling. Certainly that was the thought on my mind as I watched this depressing rehash of material that seemed original just five years ago, when it was. And ""I can't believe this is happening"" seemed to be what most of the actors were thinking as they gamely trudged through their paces yet again.  [31 May 1990, p.A12]"
670,the-town-movie,Ian Freer,80,"The Town is that rare beast, a grown-up genre flick, chock-full of compelling character dynamics and a clutch of pitch-perfect performances. "
671,ive-loved-you-so-long-movie,Steven Rea,88,"This is a picture of quiet observation, contained emotion, the hush before the cathartic scream."
672,the-madness-of-king-george-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"The Madness of King George is much more than a simple study of one man's descent into insanity. With a style that's more tongue-in-cheek than melodramatic, the film is always witty and occasionally satirical. The characterizations are flawless (as well as historically accurate), and the political wrangling of the Tories and Whigs (led by PM Pitt and Charles Fox, respectively) provide a deliciously complex backdrop."
673,a-serious-man-movie,Calvin Wilson,100,"A comedy of discomfort -- and one of their (Coen brothers) best, most insightful and most provocative films."
674,the-illusionist-1969-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"However much it conceals the real-life events that inspired it, it lives and breathes on its own, and as an extension of the mysterious whimsy of Tati."
675,predestination-movie,Drew Taylor,25,"There are so many interesting ideas and concepts that could have been spun from this framework. Instead, it's the work of a bunch of filmmakers who seemingly wanted to offer up a WTF-worthy twist ending and tried to reverse engineer a movie from it."
676,road-to-perdition-movie,Rick Kisonak,70,I'm not sure Sam Mendes' latest is a masterpiece as so many critics are exclaiming but it is very probably the most artful and earnest drama ever adapted from a comic book.
677,the-miseducation-of-cameron-post-movie,Diego Semerene,25,The film's refusal to produce a campy critique feels more like the product of lack of imagination than a purposeful repudiation.
678,the-quiet-american-movie,David Ansen,100,"Far from being a period piece, this love story/murder mystery/political thriller couldn’t seem more timely."
679,vacation-2015-movie,Michael Phillips,0,"If any of this was surprising or cleverly timed, you'd laugh and then cringe. In Vacation you cringe first and ask questions later."
680,oss-117-cairo-nest-of-spies-movie,Tasha Robinson,83,"The film bounces along on cheap but entertaining Mel Brooks-worthy audio and visual gags, like the live-chicken-throwing fight, or the sequence where the camera discreetly pans away from Dujardin and a partner making out on his hotel bed--only to focus on a full-length mirror in which they're still fully visible."
681,fist-fight-movie,Richard Roeper,0,"Had I been attending Fist Fight as a non-critic, any number of scenes might well have catapulted me out of my seat and out the door."
682,swimming-pool-movie,Carla Meyer,75,Clever and unhurried mystery.
683,divine-secrets-of-the-ya-ya-sisterhood-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"Rubber-stamped from the same mold that has produced an inexhaustible supply of fictional Southern belles who drink too much, talk too much, think about themselves too much, try too hard to be the most unforgettable character you've ever met, and are, in general, insufferable."
684,sand-castle-movie,Brian Tallerico,38,Fernando Coimbra’s Sand Castle offers too little to the War is Hell genre to be noteworthy.
685,s1m0ne-movie,Ty Burr,38,"What it is, distressingly, is a mess - a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative, of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking."
686,8-heads-in-a-duffel-bag-movie,Rita Kempley,0,"Sheer torture, the very definition of unfunniness itself."
687,another-happy-day-movie,Melissa Anderson,0,"Hoping to distract us from the zero ideas found in his film, Levinson demands that his cast act loudly and unbearably, a task for which Demi Moore, as the second wife of Ellen's first husband, is perfectly suited. "
688,walle-movie,Tasha Robinson,100,"It's Pixar's most daring experiment to date, but it still fits neatly into the studio's pantheon: Made with as much focus on heart as on visual quality, it's a sheer joy."
689,the-circle-movie,Deborah Young,90,"Both fascinates and horrifies with its bold assertions about what it means to be a woman under a cruel, institutionalized patriarchy."
690,bless-the-child-movie,Lisa Alspector,0,Horrendous dialogue and horrific directing dominate this thriller.
691,maps-to-the-stars-movie,James Mottram,100,"Detractors may carp that Cronenberg is showing us nothing new, but Maps is so flawless in its execution, it vividly refreshes the subject matter. Never overcooking the setting, it’s a story right in his wheelhouse; a very human look at characters barely clinging to their humanity."
692,fleeing-by-night-movie,Jessica Winter,10,"This dreadfully earnest inversion of the ""Concubine"" love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension."
693,the-lovely-bones-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,20,"A perfect storm of a movie disaster: You've got good actors fighting a poorly conceived script, under the guidance of a director who can no longer make the distinction between imaginativeness and computer-generated effects. The result is an expensive-looking mess that fails to capture the mood, and the poetry, of its source material."
694,raging-bull-movie,Ian Nathan,100,This is not a film about boxing. This is a film about the human condition and about cinema itself.
695,the-secret-of-the-grain-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,100,"The title embraces the richness of Kechiche's beautiful film, which captures the rhythms of displacement and hardship, the bond of family meals, and even the daily routines of the magnificent women who are part of Slimane's life."
696,tabu-movie,John Semley,100,"The pangs of romance, eroticism, anguish, and longing (both for the stolen moments of private passion and for the sense-making schematics of Empire) transcend any period of cinema Tabu may evoke."
697,reel-paradise-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"Since Reel Paradise doesn't make the mistake of lionizing Pierson while it keeps up with him and his family, the results stay with you, like memories of an unexpected and surprising vacation."
698,the-lucky-one-movie,Steven Rea,63,"Efron, who wears an ""All glory is fleeting"" tattoo on his back and a soulful look on his face, gets to be more of a grown-up in The Lucky One than in most of what he's done before."
699,mixed-nuts-movie,Janet Maslin,10,"Staged as pure fluff without an ounce of ballast, Mixed Nuts succeeds only in getting its cast into Halloween-caliber crazy costumes by the time it's over."
700,the-stepford-wives-movie,Richard Corliss,70,A film full of smart laughs. 
701,morvern-callar-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,A movie's refusal to judge bad behavior can be a subtle way of trumping the audience -- a passive-aggressive form of one-upmanship.
702,americons-movie,Martin Tsai,30,"Director Theo Avgerinos seems preoccupied with making the film look expensive, but no amount of flair could make it less vacuous. "
703,backstage-2000-movie,A.O. Scott,20,"Backstage isn't as good as the rap documentaries ""Rhyme and Reason"" and ""The Show,"" but it still casts a keen, observant eye...on this world."
704,primer-movie,Carina Chocano,70,"Frustrating as I ultimately found it, Primer is undeniably geek heaven. For everyone else, it's a nice antidote to big-budget bogusness."
705,8mm-movie,Peter Rainer,10,Wallows in its own muck.
706,mad-hot-ballroom-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Isn't just heartwarming and inspiring, it's a remarkable look at a group of children whose most noteworthy trait is that they are ordinary."
707,winnie-the-pooh-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"Little kids will enjoy it all, while parents, when not checking their cell phones, will be thankful for the thoughtfully brief running time."
708,john-q-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,Every so often a movie transcends stupidity and soars into the empyrean of true idiocy. John Q. is such a movie.
709,equals-movie,Ed Gonzalez,12,"The Drake Doremus film all comes down, simplistically and repeatedly, to “feelings make us feel alive.”"
710,passion-of-mind-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,20,Are two Demis better than one? How you answer will determine the level of patience you'll need to sit through this bizarre pet project.
711,cold-comes-the-night-movie,Tomas Hachard,12,Tze Chun's film exudes no flair in rehashing the violence and suspense of its predictable noir-thriller material.
712,filth-movie,David Ehrlich,16,"Like all of the very worst dark comedies, Jon S. Baird’s insipid and self-satisfied Filth isn’t content to merely tap into viewers’ most odious desires. It also insist that it’s revealing them."
713,what-alice-found-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"It has nothing going for it but a terrific story and an amazing performance by Judith Ivey, who plays an enigmatic Good Samaritan. "
714,thank-you-for-smoking-movie,Jack Mathews,88,It's more fun than a turkey shoot. It's also one of the most entertaining riffs on American culture in years.
715,amen-movie,J. Hoberman,70,Costa-Gavras provides a post-war postscript to make clear that honesty is punished; cynicism survives.
716,the-last-shot-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,It's deftly done with an off-the-wall sense of humor joined to a real insider's sense of how the business operates.
717,eagle-vs-shark-movie,Joe Morgenstern,70,"This debut feature, occasionally arch but consistently affecting, shares the deadpan esthetic of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and ""Ghost World."""
718,monsters-ball-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"Hank is but the latest of Thornton's strikingly taciturn characters in a whole string of movies, but for Berry, Leticia represents a big-screen breakthrough."
719,heart-of-a-dog-movie,David Edelstein,100,"Anderson says that as a child she dreamed of making something that had never been made before, and, with the help of some gifted artists and editors and camera-people, she has done it again — with bells on. The only thing that would make it more pleasurable would be Anderson narrating it in person."
720,amazing-grace-movie,Connie Ogle,75,"Apted delivers a fine, righteous climax and packs his film with some of Britain's best character actors."
721,formula-51-movie,Manohla Dargis,0,An execrable mess that leaves no genre cliché unturned or human body or soul untrammeled.
722,mary-reilly-movie,Liam Lacey,12,Mary Reilly comes across as too much brooding atmosphere and too little story. [23 Feb 1996]
723,that-thing-you-do!-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,80,"Though Hanks keeps the satirical and critical aspects of this look at show biz fairly light, there's a lot of conviction and savvy behind the steadiness of his gaze, and his economy in evoking the flavor of the period at the beginning of the picture is priceless."
724,the-expendables-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Incoherent, inept, testosterone-drenched mess, which is very much the brain-dead male equivalent of ""Sex and the City 2."""
725,columbus-movie,David Lewis,100,"The quietly stirring, exquisitely photographed Columbus is an art-house gem that beautifully illuminates not only the architecture of a small Indiana town, but also the characters that inhabit it. "
726,the-cobbler-movie,Chuck Bowen,12,Thomas McCarthy evinces no interest in the people who come into Max's store and wind up as fodder for his increasingly violent and self-absorbed escapades. Not a shred.
727,twice-born-movie,Richard Roeper,75,"Teeming with familiar war-film clichés and at times almost unbearably melodramatic, Twice Born is nevertheless worth the effort, thanks in large part to a magnificent performance from Penelope Cruz and some fine work from the international supporting cast."
728,dave-chappelles-block-party-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,"The enthralling spirit of Dave Chappelle's Block Party, its mood of exuberant democracy, extends to every rap and soul performance in the film."
729,before-midnight-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,100,"Before Midnight—visually stunning, in a late-summer way—is more vital and cutting than another recent marriage picture, Michael Haneke's old-folks-together death march Amour; it has none of Amour's tasteful restraint, and in the end, it says more about the nature of long-term love."
730,sabans-power-rangers-movie,Roger Moore,38,"The players, attractive as they are, register more as “types” filling out an EEO chart than distinct people, save for the first three introduced. The dialogue devolves into variations of “I got this.”"
731,bless-the-child-movie,Ernest Hardy,20,"Far from the worst film this summer, but it also doesn't rate strong enough to be a future video rental."
732,eye-of-the-beholder-movie,Ted Gideonse,10,Hilariously incompetent.
733,the-heart-of-me-movie,David Sterritt,75,"The film's power grows from its dark-toned portrayal of the World War II era and from its evocative use of flashbacks, which show more interest in the characters' emotional lives than in story devices like surprise and suspense. "
734,the-escape-movie,Gary Goldstein,70,"Thanks to Savage's immersive, often improvisational approach and a compellingly raw, internal turn by Arterton (""Gemma Bovery,"" ""Their Finest"") as an everyday woman who seemingly has it all... Tara's claustrophobic world and increasingly checked-out mindset feel undeniably authentic. It's also all a bit grueling to watch."
735,drive-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,"Few actors working today could make emotional sense of such a protean character, but Ryan Gosling does so with calm authority. He's a formidable presence in a film that grabs your gaze and won't let go except for moments when you can't help but look away."
736,death-at-a-funeral-2007-movie,Claudia Puig,88,The lack of propriety and solemnity is precisely what makes this comic farce so uproariously funny.
737,oceans-8-movie,Alonso Duralde,68,"The right people have been hired, and everyone is where they’re supposed to be. That level of planning makes the heist in Ocean’s 8 run fairly smoothly. As for the film itself, similarly curated with care, it gets the job done without ever being one for the record books."
738,tropic-thunder-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"When it's all over, you'll probably have the fondest memories of Robert Downey Jr.'s work. It's been a good year for him, this one coming after ""Iron Man."" He's back, big time."
739,made-movie,Mike Clark,63,The movie's success with viewers will depend on whether they think Vaughn is funny or tiresome.
740,chaplin-movie,John Hartl,75,"For a brilliant approximation of the man himself, watch Downey in this film. This is a performance created out of equal parts talent, hard work and love. It's uncanny. [08 Jan 1993, p.3]"
741,dungeons-dragons-movie,Ernest Hardy,10,Horribly slapdash affair.
742,jeepers-creepers-ii-movie,Lawrence Toppman,12,The worst horror sequel of this or many another summer.
743,sleepy-hollow-movie,David Sterritt,75,"Lots of brilliant filmmaking and high-spirited acting, at least until the story turns repetitious and formulaic in the last 30 minutes."
744,gone-in-sixty-seconds-movie,Jack Mathews,25,"A mindless, cliche-riddled action-cartoon, a blur of metal and fire and screeching tires, with bad dialogue, cardboard characters and a volume set so high, it makes the Indianapolis 500 sound like chamber music."
745,logan-2017-movie,Peter Travers,88,"If Jackman and Stewart are serious about this being their mutual X-Men swan song, they could not have crafted a more heartfelt valedictory. "
746,hot-rod-movie,Michael Sragow,16,"The filmmakers lack any visual sense of humor and any talent for sustaining long-form comedy; the stunts have less wallop than a TV bloopers show and the Oedipal family slapstick goes around in circles, in more ways than one."
747,mars-attacks!-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"In its nothing's-quite-at-stake way, Mars Attacks! has Tim Burton's flaked-out spirit -- it makes you feel like a very knowing 8-year-old, seeing through the artifice yet believing in it at the same time."
748,parenthood-movie,Staff (Not Credited),88,"While Parenthood crosses the border into schmaltz a number of times, the movie runs the gamut of realistic emotions, and one scene or another is bound to hit home with the parents who see the film."
749,mr-deeds-movie,Kenneth Turan,10,"What's most interesting about this new film is how lacking it is in any of the things, from humor to emotion to halfway decent acting, we might go to a movie for. There's not even enough here to get mad at."
750,it-comes-at-night-movie,Justin Chang,80,"The final moments of It Comes at Night go beyond the usual standards of horror-movie bleakness to achieve an almost unwatchable cruelty — a powerful accomplishment that also feels, in this context, like a limitation."
751,the-crash-movie,John DeFore,30,"Several respectable actors offer dicey performances here, but Rappaport's screenplay is the real villain, expecting thin references to real-world financial peril to paper over gaping holes in credibility and plain-old drama."
752,transformers-dark-of-the-moon-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"A visually ugly film with an incoherent plot, wooden characters and inane dialog. It provided me with one of the more unpleasant experiences I've had at the movies."
753,valentines-day-movie,Manohla Dargis,20,"This might not be the Titanic of romantic comedies (it’s tugboat size), but it’s a disaster: cynically made, barely directed, terribly written. But quick: there’s still time to escape!"
754,summer-catch-movie,Lawrence Van Gelder,10,A mound of standard-issue parent-child conflicts and enough self-help cliches to drive Polonius to the aquavit barrel at Elsinore.
755,coraline-movie,Tracie Cooper,100,"Thankfully, Coraline is appropriately dark, and like its inspiration, is only a children's movie by the thinnest of margins."
756,youth-movie,Lee Marshall,90,"The wry, flamboyant cinematic opera of Paolo Sorrentino reaches new heights of showy, utterly tasteful magnificence in Youth."
757,the-new-guy-movie,Steven Rea,12,"Reaches breathtaking lows of incoherence, sexism, racial stereotyping, and -- did I say incoherence?"
758,queen-of-the-damned-movie,Gareth Von Kallenbach,10,Audiences should demand this film be buried never to see the light of day again.
759,mea-maxima-culpa-silence-in-the-house-of-god-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Given the grievousness of their sins, one wonders why the church continues to shelter them. Might it not be more appropriate to excommunicate them, and refer them to the attention of the civil authorities?"
760,down-and-out-in-beverly-hills-movie,Roger Ebert,100,Perhaps I have made the movie sound too serious... So let me just say that Down and Out in Beverly Hills made me laugh longer and louder than any film I've seen in a long time.
761,the-lone-ranger-movie,David Edelstein,20,Appalling in ways that you could never have anticipated. The movie mixes mismatched-buddy high jinks with scenes of carnage.
762,blancanieves-movie,Robbie Collin,80,This Iberian spin on the Snow White legend is a curio and a wonder; a silent fairy tale woven from softest velvet. 
763,yoo-hoo-mrs-goldberg-movie,Gary Goldstein,70,"Entertaining, nostalgic and well-organized documentary."
764,reign-of-fire-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,Truly awful.
765,the-purge-election-year-movie,Roger Moore,38,Whatever subtlety there was remaining in the satirical intentions of The Purge franchise pretty much fly out the door and into the blood-soaked night of The Purge: Election Night.
766,the-rose-movie,Gary Arnold,30,"The best reason to see The Rose is to be in a position to relish the inevitable parody on ""Saturday Night Live."" Here's a sitting turkey that virtually sits up and begs to be plucked. [8 Nov 1979, p.F1]"
767,jet-lag-movie,Paula Nechak,67,"It's light and airy and, unlike the land-locked planes, runs the risk of nearly floating away into innocuous obscurity."
768,psycho-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,Van Sant's doomed and misguided experiment. 
769,right-now-movie,Kevin Thomas,100,"It's hard to imagine many films surpassing or even equaling the effect of this supple, breathtakingly direct, small French film."
770,money-monster-movie,Steve Persall,75,"It's a crudely populist movie designed to rouse the rabble, to loudly remind us greed isn't good. Viewers seeking another ""The Big Short"" will leave shortchanged."
771,bringing-down-the-house-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"A high-performance low comedy, House succeeds because Martin's Peter Sanderson and Latifah's Charlene Morton each plays Henry Higgins to the other's Eliza Doolittle."
772,red-lights-movie,Chuck Wilson,80,"The true mystery, Red Lights' real thrill ride -- and what seems to interest Kahn most, despite his skill at arranging the trappings of suspense -- is marriage."
773,the-client-movie,Janet Maslin,70,"The Client, with a fast, no-nonsense pace and three winning performances, is the movie that most clearly echoes the simple, vigorous Grisham style."
774,mea-maxima-culpa-silence-in-the-house-of-god-movie,Marsha McCreadie,80,"Silence might be the most perfect expression of scorn, as the saying goes, but like Edvard Munch's ""The Scream,"" you don't have to hear it to get the horror."
775,play-it-to-the-bone-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"The movie doesn't know how odd it seems to cut from the bloodshed in the ring to the dialogue of the supporting players, who still think they're in a comedy."
776,grand-canyon-movie,Julie Salamon,70,Too often the film languishes as Mr. Kasdan poses Big Questions and then has his characters answer them in conversations that are so casual they seem improvised. [26 Dec 1991]
777,viola-movie,Tomas Hachard,90,"What results is a film that takes on the vicissitudes of life and love with honest concern, but also with a shrug of the shoulders — a movie that leaves us with a smile on our faces but also more than a few thoughts in our heads."
778,a-cinderella-story-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,30,"Duff isn't exactly known for complex fare, but even ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"" was way better than this. "
779,beyond-the-hills-movie,Steven Boone,88,"Beyond the Hills is an arthouse film from Romania, yet, in its slow, lurching progress toward a tragic exorcism, it is a stylistic nephew of America's ""The Exorcist."" "
780,fences-movie,Peter Travers,88,"The movie of Fences doesn't need Hollywood bells and whistles. This writer, this director and these actors are all the magnificence required to grab your attention and hold it."
781,4-little-girls-movie,Edward Guthmann,100,4 Little Girls brilliantly captures a moment in American history and tells an achingly painful story of injustice and family loss.
782,a-moment-of-innocence-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,Muddled and endless.
783,picnic-at-hanging-rock-movie,Richard Schickel,100,"This horrific tale is told with marvelous shadowy indirection and delicate lyricism. It is full of enigmatic silences, which create a nice, ironic tension between the film's genteel manner and its really quite ferocious theme. "
784,hitman-agent-47-movie,Inkoo Kang,30,"For all its cheap talk about the importance of innovation, Agent 47 just feels like a copy of a copy of a copy."
785,the-greatest-game-ever-played-movie,Shawn Levy,67,"The film is sugary, simplistic and riddled with cliches -- yet it still manages to absorb you in its story and even carry you with some of its emotions."
786,the-hudsucker-proxy-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"With its refined wit and glorious vision, The Hudsucker Proxy is certainly deserving of a wide audience."
787,how-i-live-now-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,90,"Tender, humane, and searing, How I Live Now stands as something all too rare: a movie about young people that young people may love — but not one that lies to them, and not one built for them alone."
788,one-day-2011-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,30,"You could definitely call it awful, and I'm about to do so, repeatedly and effusively. In fact, One Day is an appallingly bad movie made by talented people who could and should have done much better, but somehow all drove off the cliff together."
789,the-13th-warrior-movie,William Arnold,67,"A straightforward, no-nonsense, agreeably old-fashioned historical action movie."
790,zodiac-movie,Scott Foundas,90,"Zodiac may be the perfect meeting of filmmaker and subject ­-- an obsessive's portrait of obsession that is, finally, a monument to irresolution."
791,the-rite-movie,Ian Buckwalter,15,"Hafstrom, on the other hand, has some serious work ahead of him if he wants any kind of absolution after this wreck."
792,company-man-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,"A skin-crawlingly unfunny riff on Woody Allen's ""Bananas."""
793,vantage-point-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Why, beating the audience about the ears, eyes and brain with essentially the same sequence of events from eight characters' points of view, none of which adds much more than deafening hysteria and identically dreadful music. The filmmakers seem to have missed the point that each re-enactment in ""Rashomon"" provides new and conflicting information. It makes you wonder if they studied the wrong movie. Maybe they rented ""Rush Hour,"" or a video on Rosh Hashanah."
794,movie-43-movie,Frank Scheck,0,"Despite the dizzying array of talent involved both in front of and behind the camera, this godawful exercise is so painfully unfunny, so screamingly bad that it immediately qualifies as one of the worst films of all time."
795,the-parent-trap-movie,Ruthe Stein,75,"Ignoring these lapses in logic, The Parent Trap' is hugely enter taining and more relevant than most family entertainment."
796,warm-water-under-a-red-bridge-movie,V.A. Musetto,63,There's not enough here to justify the almost two hours.
797,die-mommie-die!-movie,Shawn Levy,75,Hilarious mixture of Greek tragedy and Aaron Spelling soap opera that spews nasty one-liners and winking '60 signifiers like a slot machine that's paying out. 
798,cairo-time-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,"Given the rarity of such movies, and such opportunities for an actress like Clarkson, Cairo Time earns some indulgence for a pace that Westerners may find languid."
799,someone-like-you-movie,Frank Lovece,30,"Sexist, plot-hole-riddled movie equates women with cows and men with bulls."
800,larry-crowne-movie,Peter Travers,25,"Larry Crowne is more than a missed opportunity. It's alarmingly, depressingly out of touch."
801,entourage-movie,David Ehrlich,20,"Entourage can’t muster enough conflict for a podcast, let alone a feature."
802,tangerine-movie,Joe McGovern,91,Tangerine is touching for its non-condescending stance toward working girls and the spirit of the sidewalk.
803,the-lovely-bones-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,Peter Jackson siphoned out all the soulfulness that made the author's combination thriller/afterlife fantasy a best-seller. In its place is a gumball-colored potboiler that's more squalid than truly mournful.
804,tomcats-movie,Peter Travers,10,Laced with such rampant misogyny that the laughs stick in your throat.
805,forty-shades-of-blue-movie,Keith Phipps,80,"Investing a lot of time on each corner of his three-sided character piece, director Ira Sachs (who co-wrote the film with Michael Rohatyn) has created a film as dramatically intense as it is opaque."
806,sanctum-movie,Andrea Gronvall,70,"After a sluggish half hour, this well-crafted adventure kicks into high gear and never lets up. "
807,midnight-in-the-garden-of-good-and-evil-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,80,"Eastwood essentially uses the Lady Chablis the same way he did a few extended Charlie Parker solos in Bird--as unbridled, inventive improvisations that challenge the well-rehearsed ""head"" arrangements of everyone else. "
808,for-colored-girls-movie,Wesley Morris,63,It's too much too-much. The audience I saw it with didn't seem to know whether to clap when it was over or start taking Lipitor.
809,oceans-8-movie,Leah Greenblatt,75,"Ocean’s 8’s girls-just-wanna-have-grand-larceny conceit is the kind of starry, high-gloss goof the summer movie season was made for, even if it feels lightweight by the already zero-gravity standards of the genre."
810,hairbrained-movie,Sherilyn Connelly,70,Billy Kent's charming HairBrained comes from a long legacy of collegiate comedies but still finds its own identity.
811,premonition-movie,Kevin Crust,10,Its biggest failing -- and the ultimate one for a lightweight entertainment such as this -- is that it's a deadly bore from start to finish.
812,a-war-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,A War is a film done exactly right about a situation gone horribly wrong.
813,tomcats-movie,Larry Terenzi,5,There aren't even any naked chicks in it. What the hell is up with that?
814,halloween-h20-20-years-later-movie,Bob Stephens,0,"Unfortunately, the contemporary horror movie has ceased being an individual work full of surprises and fresh manifestations of the Gothic imagination - it has, instead, been reduced to the level of an inflexible, repetitious, ritualistic event."
815,i-love-you-beth-cooper-movie,Scott Foundas,10,"Joyless, offensively stupid end-of-high-school farce."
816,a-life-less-ordinary-movie,Keith Phipps,0,"At the very least, this film should hush those who insist that Diaz has talent beyond visual appeal, but it's unfair to single out her relatively minor offenses when there's so much else to hate about A Life Less Ordinary, an embarrassment for all concerned."
817,die-hard-2-movie,Jay Scott,88,"The deployment of the hardware may be extraordinary, but it doesn't overshadow the human dimension of this summer sequel. [4 July 1990]"
818,cosmopolis-movie,James Berardinelli,25,"Sometimes, even a little gratuitous nudity can't save a movie. This is one of those occasions. Cosmopolis easily trumps ""To Rome with Love"" as the biggest disappointment of 2012 from an established director. "
819,sorry-to-bother-you-movie,Tomris Laffly,91,"A film of mounting artistic imagination, Sorry to Bother You spirals into a type of mind-bending madness that is both persistently fun and one-of-a-kind."
820,freddy-got-fingered-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Green, who looks like a chinless, hollow-eyed pederast at the best of times, is simply out of his league here, and the fact that the film drags interminably when it's actually a very average 90 minutes long betrays its essential emptiness."
821,election-1999-movie,David Ansen,70,"Director Payne, who adapted Tom Perrotta's novel with Jim Taylor, has an authentically dire view of human behavior, which he expresses in crisp, edgy and sometimes startlingly raunchy style."
822,the-million-dollar-hotel-movie,Ernest Hardy,30,The film isn't very good. The Million Dollar Hotel is an uneasy melding of Hollywood shtick and art-house sensibilities.
823,dunkirk-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,88,"This is a movie of vision and integrity made on an epic scale, a series of propositions dramatized with machinery, bodies, seawater and fire. It deserves to be seen and argued about. They don't make them like this anymore. Never did, really."
824,happy-texas-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"A hoot, a hilarious comedy that's smart and caring, yet sexy and ingenious enough that it just might stir up some of that elusive ""Full Monty""-style box-office appeal."
825,thor-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Like Thor's hammer, this ersatz epic bludgeons its victims into submission. What's more, it requires them to stare at the source of their punishment through 3-D glasses."
826,bluebird-movie,Keith Phipps,70,"Shooting on 35mm, Jody Lee Lipes makes the harshness look beautiful and unforgiving, and in a film filled with strong performances, Morton’s work stands out."
827,fantastic-four-movie,Scott Foundas,30,"Directing seems an unduly elegant term for what Hollywood hack du jour Tim Story (Barbershop, Taxi) does here -- the action scenes are so choppily constructed that their excitement disappears faster than the Invisible Woman."
828,15-minutes-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"If Detroit had produced an equivalent lemon, we might have been seeing the world's first one-wheeled, square-tired car with no cooling system, steering wheel or brakes."
829,where-the-wild-things-are-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"In elaborating on the original book so boldly, and repopulating it so richly, Jonze has protected Where the Wild Things Are as an inviolable literary work. In preserving its darkest spirit, he's created a potent, fully realized variation on its most highly charged themes."
830,the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn---part-1-movie,Dan Kois,30,"Condon delivers the most authoritatively directed Twilight film so far, which only brings into sharp relief how tonally incoherent its story is."
831,towelhead-movie,Zack Haddad,100,"Racism, teen sex, and war are all hot button issues. When you are a young person these things can seem new and confusing. In Alan Ball’s genius Towelhead, all of those above mentioned subjects go hand-in-hand in a truly wonderful cinematic experience."
832,whipped-movie,William Arnold,0,Perhaps there is a more excruciatingly painful and self-abusive way to spend 82 minutes. But I honestly can't think of what it would be.
833,5-days-of-war-movie,Jaime N. Christley,12,Renny Harlin seems now incapable of taking a movie even as far as a few frames. 
834,the-matrix-movie,Jack Mathews,75,A dazzlingly original visual adventure.
835,magic-mike-xxl-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"""Magic Mike"" was self-contained, made with no expectation of a second chapter - and they prove unable to surmount it. Too many elements that made the first film an enjoyable experience are missing."
836,america-imagine-a-world-without-her-movie,James Rocchi,0,"It would be one thing if D'Souza had an idea, or any idea, he could stick to as a through-line in his project. But America isn't a documentary; it's more like the badly-filmed version of a badly-written, meandering op-ed piece from a paper that lacks fact-checking or proofreading."
837,one-shot-movie,Drew Taylor,83,"In terms of pure pop entertainment value, you'll be hard-pressed to find a more smartly constructed, beautifully shot, pulse-pounding movie this holiday season."
838,room-237-movie,Ty Burr,88,"Watching Room 237 is like being stuck on an airplane next to a stranger hellbent on convincing you of his very detailed, very paranoid theory of the universe. Actually, it’s like being stuck on a plane full of those guys, each with a different yet compellingly insane take on reality. And the in-flight entertainment features only one movie: “The Shining.” "
839,dracula-pages-from-a-virgins-diary-movie,John Powers,90,"Maddin's genius is so inescapably idiosyncratic that his work seems destined to remain a cult taste. Although Dracula won't change that, I hasten to add that this is the most inventive vampire picture of the last 80 years."
840,the-lazarus-effect-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,25,"Despite classy lead performances by Mark Duplass and Olivia Wilde, the movie, from horror factory Blumhouse (known for cranking out sequels in the “Paranormal Activity” franchise, among others), relies too heavily on reanimated monster movie cliches and scientific gibberish to keep it alive. "
841,head-over-heels-movie,David Sterritt,0,"This romantic comedy is so awfully misjudged and ineptly executed in every department that, while it isn't quite a contender for the ""so bad it's good"" category, this critic was nonetheless dabbing tears of laughter from his eyes."
842,jack-and-jill-movie,Jennie Punter,25,A noxious PG comedy starring Adam Sandler as a pair of middle-aged male-female twins that should have been separated at birth to spare us from this movie. 
843,florence-foster-jenkins-movie,Roger Moore,75,"Florence is hilarious, and sadly fragile, and Streep makes her pain both funny and poignant. "
844,the-dukes-movie,Peter Travers,75,"From the Emeralds doing ""Acapella"" to Davi himself taking the lead on ""So Much in Love,"" The Dukes is damn near impossible to resist."
845,sin-nombre-movie,Andrea Gronvall,90,Writer-director Cary Fukunaga keeps the story lean while peppering it with realistic details.
846,grown-ups-movie,Marc Savlov,20,"Grown Ups is exactly, beat for beat, what the previews would have you believe: a depressingly predictable, two-chuckle deconstruction of what Sandler sees as the modern American male."
847,hansel-and-gretel-witch-hunters-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,"The Brothers Grimm may have come up with some cruel, weird material in their day, but they'd never condone actor abuse like this."
848,license-to-wed-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"There's bad, there's awful and there's horrible, and then somewhere beyond that, in its own Kingdom of Lousy -- where all the milk curdles and the jokes aren't funny -- is License to Wed, the latest ghastly exercise starring Robin Williams."
849,baby-driver-movie,John DeFore,80,"A crime-flick love story as Pop-conscious as Wright's earlier work but unironic about its romantic core, it will delight the director's fans but requires no film-geek certification."
850,mamma-mia!-here-we-go-again-movie,Harry Haun,80,"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is a minor miracle of a musical, something you never thought you would ever see. "
851,chips-movie,Simon Abrams,12,"This isn't a knowing parody of a beloved show, a la the 2012 reboot/parody ""21 Jump Street""; it's a sample of the brain-dead entertainment against which its creators are supposedly reacting."
852,thomas-in-love-movie,Kenneth Turan,80,"Starts gently, with amusing drollness, then gets more serious, even provocative, without sacrificing its light touch. This is very much a film with something on its mind."
853,the-giver-movie,David Lee Dallas,38,The internal crisis of its protagonist amounts to the flicking of an on/off switch rather than the ebb and flow of a consciousness being born.
854,the-haunted-mansion-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,"This mostly laugh-and scare-free turkey offers an utterly bored -- and boring -- Eddie Murphy taking a back seat to special effects, elaborate sets and a wispy story slapped together by David Berenbaum (the overrated ""Elf""). "
855,bruce-almighty-movie,Stephen Hunter,20,Something between an indiscretion and an atrocity.
856,with-all-deliberate-speed-movie,V.A. Musetto,38,"Something high schoolers might yawn through in history class, but they have no choice. You do."

859,game-night-movie,Richard Lawson,70,"It’s a good time, but it maybe could have been a great one. Which I suppose is true of so many nights meant to deliver us from the doldrums of settled life. I don’t think that meta-ness is a deliberate feature of Game Night. But with all the sharpness Daley and Goldstein show us here, I’m not ruling it out, either."
860,juno-movie,Peter Rainer,91,"At its best, Juno is about the messy things in life that are not so easily summarized."
861,pretty-persuasion-movie,Sean Axmaker,0,"The disingenuous attempt to give the tawdry story some kind of social import only makes the tinny caricatures more insincere, while his erotic display of 15-year-old girls isn't a satire of a sexualized culture, it's just dirty."
862,bewitched-movie,Michael Atkinson,0,To spend even 10 minutes in the movie's universe is to experience the Sartrean nausea of an utterly hollow head and heart.
863,smokin-aces-movie,Peter Debruge,25,"The hyper-stylized violence, for instance, isn't nearly as senseless as the narrative bits in between. And the ''twist'' employs the same sleight-of-hand as ""The Usual Suspects."""
864,the-grapes-of-wrath-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,"The Grapes of Wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book. It is certainly the best picture Darryl F. Zanuck has produced or Nunnally Johnson scripted. It would be the best John Ford had directed if he had not already made ""The Informer."""
865,tea-with-mussolini-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"The movie seemed the stuff of anecdote, not drama, and as the alleged protagonist, Luca/Franco is too young much of the time to play more than a bystander's role."
866,the-ardennes-movie,Clayton Dillard,38,It predictably lurches toward acts of extreme violence with little interest other than the instant titillation such moments afford.
867,can-a-song-save-your-life-movie,David Denby,70,"Sappy but engaging. [7 & 14 July 2014, p.95]"
868,fired-up!-movie,Aaron Hillis,10,"We're light years away from ""Animal House,"" sure, but who ever thought we would long for the richer, funnier dignity of ""American Pie?"""
869,snatch-movie,Lisa Alspector,30,"Ritchie may be skilled at generating controlled chaos, but his surprise-a-minute strategy ultimately holds no surprises; Snatch is even more frenetically boring than his 1999 ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."""
870,sabotage-movie,Louis Black,11,"The violence is always vicious, the catalog of brutally attacked, pornographically bloody bodies is unending, and despite the abundance of action the film is terribly dull."
871,district-9-movie,Justin Chang,90,"Though compelling throughout, District 9 never becomes outright terrifying, largely because Blomkamp is less interested in exploiting his aliens for cheap scares than in holding up a mirror to our own bloodthirsty, xenophobic species."
872,better-housekeeping-movie,Ed Park,20,"Too stupid to be satire, too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise, Frank Novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless. (""Good Housekeeping"" magazine's legal muscle forced a last-minute change.)"
873,showgirls-movie,Barbara Shulgasser,0,That Berkley cannot act is indisputable. But her dancing looks like a seizure.
874,water-movie,Kyle Smith,63,"Gandhi did save India from the British, but he didn't save India from the Indians, and the horrific subjugation of widows continues there even today. It was only 10 years ago that Mehta encountered the Hindu widow who inspired her film."
875,king-arthur-legend-of-the-sword-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Ritchie aspires to be a great British director, but his working his way through British icons — Sherlock Holmes wasn’t even safe — does no one any good. He just reduces them to his own vernacular, his own level, and he ends up revealing nothing about them and everything about his own narrow vision. "
876,angels-in-the-outfield-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"So syrupy-sweet in its depictions of the game, angels, orphans, children's wishes, and estranged parents, that it may be all you can do to keep from taking a Louisville Slugger to the projectionist."
877,mission-impossible-fallout-movie,Brian Tallerico,100,"It’s got that finely-tuned, perfect blend of every technical element that it takes to make a great action film, all in service of a fantastic script and anchored by great action performances to not just work within the genre but to transcend it. This is one of the best movies of the year."
878,the-party-movie,Stephen Dalton,70,A charming little tragicomedy which flirts with savage social satire but never fully embraces it.
879,one-last-kiss-movie,Peter Rainer,80,"It's a frisky, funny roundelay starring Stefania Sandrelli, and it features enough shouting and arm-waving to power a windmill."
880,bewitched-movie,Robert Wilonsky,0,"This hackneyed, hapless and utterly useless redo of an overrated 1960s sitcom is excruciating to sit through for a dozen reasons."
881,redacted-movie,Rick Groen,75,"Love it, hate it, but be sure to watch it, because this odd and disturbing picture is as different as the war it reflects, and that difference is vast enough to seem profound."
882,air-guitar-nation-movie,Kevin Crust,70,"It's one of the charms of Air Guitar Nation that much of it plays like a mockumentary in which you're not quite sure who's pulling your leg. But it's real, even if the guitars are not."
883,the-order-movie,David Ng,10,This ghost-in-the-Vatican thriller regurgitates enough occult clichés to deserve its own special circle of hell.
884,movie-43-movie,Nathan Rabin,16,"The sketches aren't united by a half-ignored framing device, so much as by an enduring fascination with bodily functions. Movie 43 is the most star-studded collection of jokes involving menstruation, flatulence, incest, bestiality, Snooki, and nutsacks ever assembled, but the stars don't elevate the material-they just descend to its level. "
885,ghost-ship-movie,Jonathan Foreman,25,"A big, incoherent bore, interesting only as an example of assembly-line movie-making gone awry."
886,poetic-justice-movie,Desson Howe,80,"Often graceful, sometimes brilliant, Poetic is an absorbing, amusing symphony of sound and image; it also gives equal weight to its male and female characters."
887,surge-of-power-revenge-of-the-sequel-movie,Kimber Myers,10,"It is a master class in how not to make a film, beginning with lessons in writing an unfunny script, leaving foundation makeup visible on actors’ faces and sound editing that overemphasizes a bland score."
888,must-love-dogs-movie,Connie Ogle,75,"View it as a fat-free but tasty cinematic treat in the middle of the long, hot summer."
889,enron-the-smartest-guys-in-the-room-movie,Helen O'Hara,100,"Despite the talking heads and grainy blow-ups of TV footage, the film boasts some rather gorgeous cinematography and moves briskly, with the interviews masterfully edited."
890,thanks-for-sharing-movie,Jason Anderson,75,"Though Blumberg treats the topic with admirable frankness, the film’s insights would’ve had more impact if he wasn’t so quick to hop to the next storyline whenever matters get especially thorny."
891,mister-foe-movie,Grant Butler,67,"If you've been wondering what Billy Elliot would look like all grown up, naked or in a fetching frock, here's your chance."
892,broadway-danny-rose-movie,Jay Scott,88,"Splendidly viewed through Gordon Willis' gleaming black and white cinematography, the story of Danny Rose, narrated by a group of aged comics reminiscing at the Carnegie Deli, becomes a bittersweet examination of dreams that don't come true. [27 Jan 1984]"
893,bride-wars-movie,Rick Groen,25,The movie pretty much blows.
894,the-circle-movie,Peter Brunette,90,"The fact that this film, so sensitive to woman's plight, was made by a man is perhaps cause for a little hope."
895,the-slaughter-rule-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,An overwrought drama.
896,mixed-nuts-movie,Amy Gamerman,10,"The oddballs of Mixed Nuts are oddly lackluster -- starting with Mr. Martin, who ambles through the movie with a stunned look on his face. [22 Dec 1994, p.A12]"
897,horrible-bosses-movie,Connie Ogle,38,"Slow-witted, clumsy and almost pathologically reliant on crude name-calling for laughs - Horrible Bosses represents the lowest end of the comedy spectrum."
898,alan-partridge-alpha-papa-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,80,So clear your calendar. There’s no better time to get to know a character so obnoxiously stubborn that not even his own creator can shake him.

900,whitney-can-i-be-me-movie,Eric Henderson,38,"It's no surprise that Nick Broomfield finds little use for the moments of unabashed triumphalism in Houston's life, as he's doggedly fixated on the humiliating swan dive."
901,the-rite-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,65,"Hopkins is having a blast, and he's fun to watch."
902,invictus-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"As always, Freeman is a one-man charm offensive."
903,running-on-empty-movie,Janet Maslin,70,"Running on Empty works best when it plays upon emotions generated by the Popes' unique predicament, something that it often does rather shamelessly. It helps that Sidney Lumet has directed the film in a crisp, handsome style that diminishes the maudlin or unlikely aspects of its story, even when they threaten to intrude. "
904,potiche-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,"Helping to keep this ship from keeling over is the great professionalism and light touch of Deneuve and Depardieu. Costars numerous times, they go together as comfortably as an old pair of gloves. Potiche very much counts on this, and it has not miscalculated."
905,the-trumpet-of-the-swan-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,A brightly colored but terminally dull cartoon.
906,view-from-the-top-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"All the same, it's a feat to find the lowest common denominator at 40,000 feet; View From the Top would be perfect as the first in-flight offering of the new Hooters airline."

909,what-alice-found-movie,Michael Atkinson,30,"Ivey hits the turf pitching and catching dialogue like a pro, but nothing could have saved What Alice Found from a fundamental cinematic illiteracy. "
910,thunderbirds-movie,David Sterritt,25,"The action is snappy and quick, but why does this youth-targeted adventure pit white male heroes against a trio of villains comprising a black man, an Asian man, and an ugly woman?"
911,waltz-with-bashir-movie,Michael Phillips,100,"It is personal filmmaking of the highest order, recognized with an Academy Award nomination for best foreign film."
912,phantom-halo-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,30,"Although the performances, including that of Rebecca Romijn channeling Cybill Shepherd as a femme fatale type, are sturdy, their characters have been given absolutely nowhere interesting to go. "
913,people-like-us-movie,Andrew Schenker,12,This dry-as-dust enterprise bogs down in an almost total lack of energy and imagination that no amount of faux earnestness can overcome.
914,nine-movie,Scott Foundas,30,"Wisely keeping her distance, Cotillard mostly lurks along the sidelines projecting a wounded visage, before finally stepping into the spotlight for the movie's single moment of emotional sincerity. It's the only point at which Nine seems more than a total zero."
915,the-a-team-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,30,"Big-name star Liam Neeson looks on, trying to add some class to the joint, though even he seems to know it's a losing battle."
916,me-without-you-movie,Kevin Thomas,70,"An engaging, straightforward narrative about two childhood playmates and the stages of their friendship from 1973 to 2001."
917,game-6-movie,Maitland McDonagh,38,"Though Keaton is convincing as a smarmy narcissist who secretly thinks he deserves to fail because writing plays isn't REAL work, he's also thoroughly unlikable -- a problematic trait in a protagonist."
918,maryam-movie,V.A. Musetto,63,Well-meaning but flawed drama.
919,dunkirk-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"The surpassing accomplishment of Dunkirk is to make us feel an almost literal fusion with its story. It's not so much that we've seen a splendid movie, though we have, but as if we've been taken inside a historic event, become wholly immersed in something real and alive."
920,the-other-boleyn-girl-movie,William Arnold,83,"An absorbing, exciting costume drama that works as a historical romance, a family tragedy and a showcase for its young stars."
921,the-musketeer-movie,Charles Taylor,10,"There isn't a frame of The Musketeer that's believable even as a Hollywood re-creation of a fantasy world. It's conventionally picturesque, except in the nighttime and interior scenes, which are dark to the point of glaucoma."
922,dragonfly-movie,Kevin Thomas,10,"Appalling, shamelessly manipulative and contrived, and totally lacking in conviction."
923,anaconda-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,67,"Directed by Luis Llosa with all of the subtlety of a snake-oil salesman, is in the great tradition of cinematic cheese, as processed as Kraft Singles slices.  [18 Apr 1997, p. 48]"
924,newsies-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"It's a bit of a throwback and a solid family film and, at the time, represented a well-intentioned leap of faith of the sort that studios rarely take."
925,the-man-with-two-brains-movie,Staff (Not Credited),88,"The Man with Two Brains, which never ceases to amuse, is at its best when most outrageous."
926,monsters-inc-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,Who doesn't need what this movie has to give?
927,bad-santa-2-movie,Michael Roffman,0,"Everything’s so achingly foul and with zero finesse, which makes for an awful, joyless experience."
928,shame-movie,Kimberley Jones,89,"Equally harrowing and heartrending, Shame is a film that feels akin to going into battle, and I for one didn't emerge unscathed."
929,the-town-movie,Ann Hornaday,75,"It's a smart, bold genre exercise that's enormous fun to watch, harking back to gritty urban thrillers of the 1970s with an assured sense of tone and style."
930,mystery-men-movie,F. X. Feeney,70,Mystery Men gives proof that satire isn't dead.
931,return-to-paradise-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Return to Paradise is ""Midnight Express"" remade from the outside, as existential quandary. It has the moody, disquieting undertow of a true moral thriller."
932,page-one-a-year-inside-the-new-york-times-movie,Stephen Cole,63,"Alas, the filmmaker, maybe because he had to account for every week of his more than year-long visit to the Times, has crowded his film with too many subplots and way, way too many cameos of all the usual suspects, wringing their hands over what will become of newspapers. "
933,good-time-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"Having already admired Pattinson’s post-vampire work in David Cronenberg’s ""Cosmopolis"" and elsewhere, I wasn’t surprised to see him kill it in this role as a shambling antihero in the ""Dog Day Afternoon"" mode. With this movie, both Pattinson and the Safdie brothers have broken new ground in their careers."
934,2016-obamas-america-movie,Stephen Farber,30,"No one doubts that the country faces major challenges in the next four years, but there is one safe bet: The future is unlikely to be affected by this simplistic documentary."
935,boyz-n-the-hood-movie,Mike Clark,88,"In a watershed year for black filmmakers, Singleton has made the punchiest feature debut in recent memory. Those who complain that Lee's characters tangle up his plots will savor Singleton's flawlessly crafted edges. [12 July 1991]"
936,the-dance-of-reality-movie,Noel Murray,70,"It’s more gentle and fanciful in tone, and though it’s as episodic and digressive as Jodorowsky’s best-known work, the various pieces add up to a clear, not-so-odd narrative."
937,overboard-2018-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,38,"As movie-going experiences go, there is nothing worse than to sit through what purports to be a comedy and never have a reason to engage your laugh reflex. Exhibit A: The gender-switch remake of the 1987 screwball farce, ""Overboard."""
938,universal-soldier-the-return-movie,Russel Smith,0,"Lame, mindless dialogue makes Wing Commander seem Cukoresque by comparison."
939,the-majestic-movie,Andy Klein,10,"Indeed, the best that can be said about The Majestic is that it may boost Capra's reputation by virtue of comparison. Apparently, it's not so easy to weave that kind of magic."
940,the-family-stone-movie,Carrie Rickey,63,The slapstick weeper The Family Stone is a lump of coal brightened by four diamond-sharp performances.
941,monster-in-law-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"Monster-in-Law fails the Gene Siskel Test: ""Is this film more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?"""
942,the-child-movie,Roger Ebert,100,Here is a film where God does not intervene and the directors do not mistake themselves for God. It makes the solutions at the ends of other pictures seem like child's play.
943,dont-breathe-movie,Amy Nicholson,83,"Don’t Breathe is a small delight, like stumbling across a shiny silver dollar. "
944,on-chesil-beach-movie,Jared Mobarak,83,Its authentic depiction of unprepared young love is delicately innocent.
945,ice-age-continental-drift-movie,Sean OConnell,75,The fourth Ice Age freshens up the 10-year-old franchise by shunning easy ­pop-culture jokes and embracing its weird side.
946,shes-out-of-my-league-movie,Walter Addiego,25,About as close to pure mall fodder as you'll see.
947,class-movie,Gary Arnold,30,"Class, a sexual disillusion acted out at the prep school level, would be represented far more accurately by the one-word title ""Crass."" [22 July 1983, p.C4]"
948,half-past-dead-movie,A.O. Scott,20,"After several scenes of this tacky nonsense, you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions, especially because Half Past Dead is like ""The Rock"" on a Wal-Mart budget. And the marked-down price tags are incredibly visible."
949,this-means-war-movie,Rex Reed,0,"The result is 98 minutes of moronic stupidity already being labeled on the Internet as ""the worst movie of the year."""
950,the-quick-and-the-dead-movie,Kenneth Turan,20,"The Quick and the Dead is showy visually, full of pans and zooming close-ups. Rarely dull, it is not noticeably compelling either, and as the derivative offshoot of a derivative genre, it inevitably runs out of energy well before any of its hotshots runs out of bullets."
951,meet-dave-movie,Ken Fox,75,"Aside from some unnecessarily crude stereotypes, Eddie Murphy's least-painful comedy in years has a certain peculiar charm."
952,the-worlds-end-movie,A.A. Dowd ,91,"Easily one of the year’s best comedies, the movie thrives off the chemistry between its leads, with Pegg painting a very funny portrait of emotional paralysis and Frost demonstrating a heretofore unseen talent for intimidation. "
953,the-muppets-movie,Joe Williams,75,"The troupe's first film in more than a decade, is a more aggressively absurd antidote to what it calls ""a hard, cynical world."" Happily, it works."
954,shaun-the-sheep-movie-movie,Kate Erbland,91,"Clocking in at a slim 85 minutes, the whole thing flies by quite pleasingly, a warm and funny feature that reasserts the value of high quality visuals and attention to detail."
955,the-deep-blue-sea-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,38,"The story is maddeningly oblique and incomplete, despite paying what at times feels like excruciating attention to the minutiae of a dying love affair's final hours."
956,carandiru-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,"Carandiru, which ends with actual footage of the prison being demolished in 2002, marks a terrific comeback for Babenco - it's the roughest picture of life behind bars since ""Midnight Express."" "
957,waltz-with-bashir-movie,Jonathan Curiel,100,The best movie of 2008? The most revealing war film ever made? The greatest animated feature to come out of Israel? All these descriptions could apply to Waltz With Bashir.
958,the-devils-own-movie,Roger Ebert,63,The moral reasoning in the film is so confusing that only by completely sidestepping it can the plot work at all.
959,bad-boys-ii-movie,Mike Clark,38,Appallingly mean-spirited.
960,paris-36-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,It's like a pastry that's been sitting on the shelf for 60 years.
961,nina-movie,Dan Callahan,0,"Nina, an infuriatingly amateurish picture about the great singer and pianist Nina Simone, is a new low for the musical biopic genre."
962,wet-hot-american-summer-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,The movie is so hilariously sly about something so fetishistically trivial that at times it appears to take in an entire culture through a lens made of cheese.
963,the-bounty-hunter-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Aniston doesn’t bring her old A-game to this. But at least she’s not quiet and reserved and no-energy, her approach to too many roles of late. Butler makes the most of his Neanderthal rut."
964,eat-pray-love-movie,Peter Travers,25,The movie left me with the feeling of being trapped with a person of privilege who won't stop with the whine whine whine.
965,leave-no-trace-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"Everybody connected to this movie appears to be operating on the same wavelength: They want to do justice to the lives of the people that we see. To a remarkable degree, they do."
966,sex-tape-movie,Richard Corliss,10,Massively stupid: preposterous yet boring.
967,the-last-shaman-movie,Nick Schager,30,"At once superficial and overblown, this documentary also often feels downright phony."
968,gun-shy-movie,Peter Stack,25,"It's implausible, cartoonishly overdrawn."
969,holy-motors-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Holy Motors, fueled by pure feeling, is a dream of a movie you want to get lost in. It's a thing of beauty."
970,the-dark-knight-movie,Bob Mondello,95,The real relationship here is between a Batman in existential crisis and a Joker who'd love to leap with him into the abyss -- tight-a--ed yin and anarchist yang in a fantasy franchise that Nolan has made as riveting for its psychological heft as for the adrenaline rushes it inspires at regular intervals.
971,ravenous-movie,Staff (Not credited),25,"You don't want to see this bilge. Director Milcho Manchevski, who was fired in midproduction, is the only one with cause to celebrate."
972,the-perfect-score-movie,Desson Thomson,20,"Luckily, life (just like the SAT) has its multiple-choice options. You don't actually have to watch this. "
973,twelve-and-holding-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,80,Cuesta directs the lead actors with such feeling that their misery seems authentic.
974,the-amityville-horror-movie,David Edelstein,0,"I'd like to tell you about the remake of The Amityville Horror (MGM), but I ankled after less than five minutes. It was something about the little girl holding the stuffed animal getting blown away with a shotgun at point-blank range."
975,chicago-movie,Bill Gallo,100,"The singing and dancing in this Chicago are uniformly splendid, right down to Gere's tap dancing. The high wit and dark eroticism Marshall brings to the famous ""Cell Block Tango"" number are matchless."
976,here-on-earth-movie,Andy Klein,10,"It would be heartening if the adolescent girls of America turned their backs on this pandering piece of kitsch, but that would be hoping too much."
977,big-mommas-house-movie,Tom Keogh,10,This is pretty much a lazy film with a few lighthearted moments and no substance.
978,spring-breakers-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,12,"How on earth is it possible for one film to be so tiresome? Spring Breakers isn’t deadly dull despite all the nudity and violence, but because of it. "
979,election-1999-movie,Wesley Morris,100,"With Election, Payne announces himself as one of the keenest purveyors of the scattered pieces that once was an American morality."
980,the-love-guru-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"The road taken by The Love Guru could hardly be lower, and leads nowhere."
981,pierrepoint-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,75,"This measured bio-production might be viewed as a lesser companion piece to ""Vera Drake"" -- although in the case of Pierrepoint: The Last Hangman, all the period-piece tastefulness makes for a story more instructive than emotionally tangible."
982,grown-ups-2-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,The film is so slight that it feels less like a proper sequel to Grown Ups than a failed television spin-off that inexplicably cast Sandler and the gang in the lead roles instead of their low-budget television equivalents.
983,the-way-way-back-movie,Mike Scott,80,"The Way, Way Back is way, way good -- and a welcome breath of fresh air at the summertime box office."
984,lethal-weapon-movie,Johanna Steinmetz,12,"The melodramatic clumsiness of the script, and, in one scene, its gratuitous endorsement of marijuana, betrays the youth of its writer, recent UCLA graduate Shane Black. And veteran director Richard Donner, whose credits include another cartoon movie, can't seem to thread the scenes together in any meaningful way. [6 Mar 1987, p.G]"
985,midnight-sun-movie,Danielle White,20,"Perhaps it’s just not-the-best-translation of ""Taiyō no Uta,"" the title of the 2006 Japanese original, but I’m (unfortunately) not a language scholar, so I can’t be certain either way. What I can tell you is that this remake kind of sucks."
986,a-glimpse-inside-the-mind-of-charles-swan-iii-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,It isn’t a movie so much as a feature-length perfume commercial for a Charlie Sheen signature cologne with gorgeous packaging and absolutely nothing inside.
987,the-ring-two-movie,Wesley Morris,25,Scares up few chills.
988,brick-mansions-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"There's no fun to be had here and if an action movie doesn't make the grade as escapist entertainment, what's the point?"
989,the-relic-movie,Richard Harrington,10,"As written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, The Relic deserved to be taken off the shelf; as adapted by a quartet of screenwriters and directed by Peter Hyams, it should have been left on one."
990,shes-funny-that-way-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"A screwball farce that pulls off a pitifully low percentage of its gags, even with a star-crammed cast."
991,wonder-movie,David Ehrlich,75,"Wonder is as manipulative as movies get, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes a story needs to steer you; sometimes a story tells you what to feel, but redeems itself by virtue of the sincerity with which it shows why you should feel that way."
992,extinction-2018-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Here, he’s (Peña) bland, under-emoting in the face of terror and fronting a middling actioner that isn’t as thought-provoking as its creators expected, as surprising as they think it’s “twist” is and isn’t smart enough to get out of its own way."
993,the-killer-inside-me-movie,Amy Biancolli,25,It looks spiffy. It has an attractive cast. Marcel Zyskind's cinematography seethes and shines. And it's a crock.
994,hero-movie,Sean Axmaker,91,"Yimou plays his images like a visual symphony, and turns a potential costume pageant into an exhilarating national myth."
995,call-me-by-your-name-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,An almost sinfully enjoyable movie that both observes and obeys the languid rhythms of a torrid Italian summer.
996,elizabeth-movie,Peter Travers,70,The film belongs to Blanchett -- this hellcat Virgin Queen is something to see.
997,all-the-money-in-the-world-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,75,"All the Money in the World may not have that many surprises up its sleeve, especially if you already know how this story ends. You will, however, get your money’s worth, one way or another: whether it’s from the crime thriller or the thought-provoking sermon on filthy lucre that it throws in, at no extra charge."
998,a-little-bit-of-heaven-movie,Manohla Dargis,0,"A cringe-inducing romantic comedy turned cancer tragedy turned inspirational hosanna about living in the moment, embracing your bliss and other clichés. "
999,beirut-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Even decades after it was written Beirut is as relevant as it is entertaining, and it is very entertaining indeed."
1000,runaway-bride-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"[Gere] seemed to be improvising his way from beginning to end, like he was disgusted with the actual script."
1001,the-sword-and-the-sorcerer-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"The Sword and the Sorcerer is so dominated by its special effects, its settings and locations, that it doesn't care much about character. It trots its people onscreen, gives them names and labels, and puts them through their paces. That's not enough."
1002,man-of-the-year-movie,Ethan Alter,25,"The film is laughable when it tries to be dramatic and stone-faced when it strains to be funny. Beyond that, Man of the Year is often so wildly off the mark in its depiction of how elections are run, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same guy who helmed ""Wag the Dog,"" one of the savviest political films ever made."
1003,midnight-in-paris-movie,Dana Stevens,70,"A trifle in both senses of the word: a feather-light, disposable thing, and a rich dessert appealingly layered with cake, jam, and cream. "
1004,top-five-movie,Peter Travers,88,Top Five is Rock's best movie by a mile. It's authentically hilarious.
1005,bats-movie,Lisa Alspector,10,"All I saw were unimpressive digital effects; artless, quick-cut abstracted gore; and a last-ditch attempt to evoke a visceral response by heaping the climactic scene with bat shit."
1006,harlem-nights-movie,Staff (Not Credited),10,"This blatantly excessive directorial debut for Eddie Murphy is overdone, too rarely funny and, worst of all, boring."
1007,the-master-of-disguise-movie,Charles Taylor,10,"I understand how hard it is for parents to find movies to take their kids to, but the thought of them or their children getting stuck at this stinker galls me. Summer vacation feels short enough as it is."
1008,revenge-of-the-green-dragons-movie,Nikola Grozdanovic,16,"Loo and Lau’s Dragons is too busy reveling in tilted angles, music video editing, mind-numbingly clichéd dialogue, wooden acting and a one-dimensional story about brotherhood."
1009,hot-pursuit-movie,Kevin C. Johnson,38,"The trailers for the Reese Witherspoon-Sofia Vergara comedy Hot Pursuit hint at a movie that’s unfunny, insufferable and obvious. You can’t say you weren’t warned."
1010,an-american-werewolf-in-paris-movie,Kevin Thomas,10,"A painfully anemic variation on John Landis' 1981 winner, ""An American Werewolf in London."" While the original had both wit and poignancy--and an affectionate and knowing tip-of-the-hat to werewolf movies past--this slapdash, silly new edition is so cut-rate it has Luxembourg and Amsterdam standing in for the City of Light."
1011,heartbeats-movie,Bob Mondello,75,"Style over substance? Well, yes, but Dolan's a precocious talent (a decent actor, to boot), and at the advanced age of 21, has all the time in the world to deal with weightier matters. Heartbeats, meanwhile, is fluff - engaging, moody, visually snappy fluff."
1012,harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2-movie,Richard Corliss,90,"It is indeed impressive; and we mean not just this solid, satisfying final film - in which the Potter saga reaches its climax, if not quite its emotional apex - but the entirety of producer David Heyman's blockbuster franchise."
1013,chelsea-walls-movie,Jami Bernard,12,"The actor's directorial debut is a lugubriously poetic homage to the famed Chelsea Hotel, which is to New York's artistic and beatnik past what Ellis Island is to the story of American immigration."
1014,catch-me-if-you-can-movie,David Sterritt,75,"Spielberg's directing is a tad less tricky than usual, but he doesn't have much talent for psychological suspense, which is the heart of the story. DiCaprio underplays nicely and Walken is superb as the con artist's downtrodden dad."
1015,hector-and-the-search-for-happiness-movie,Steve Macfarlane,25,It culminates in a weepy climax that verifies its status as a proud hunk of propaganda from America's massive self-help industry.
1016,hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-movie,Tom Huddleston,80,Overall this is an absolute pleasure. There are times when Waititi’s script borders on genius.
1017,a-little-bit-of-heaven-movie,Steven Rea,0,"As far as director Nicole Kassell and writer Gren Wells are concerned, the C in Big C must stand for cute. The film reaches into the pits of moviegoing hell when it finds Marley on a celestial white couch, ringed in billowing white curtains, communing with God. And God is embodied by Whoopi Goldberg."
1018,paul-blart-mall-cop-2-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"James' everyman appeal is stretched to the limits here, like that polyester shirt he wears. "
1019,splice-movie,Michael Ordona,90,"In its mix are ethical quandaries in biotechnology, nature versus nurture and an adorable-sexy-disturbing monster. So there's that. But it wins best in show by focusing on one of the weirder relationship triangles in recent memory."
1020,the-ringer-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,0,"The Ringer is astoundingly craptastic not because the handicapped are handled poorly (though if they were paid more than union scale I'd be surprised), but because it's one of the most singularly unfunny films ever made."
1021,back-to-the-future-movie,Eric Henderson,88,"Back to the Future stands up on its own as a well-oiled, brilliantly-edited example of new-school, Spielberg-cultivated thrill-craft, one that endures even now that its visual effects and haw-haw references to Pepsi Free and reruns seem as dated as full-service gas stations apparently did in 1985. "
1022,three-extremes-movie,Eric Campos,90,"So here it is, an arena rock type film event for lovers of Asian cinema. Good news is that you won’t have that annoying ringing in your ears the day after. Better news is that you’ll have food for thought way after witnessing these spectacles."
1023,starlet-movie,Melissa Anderson,70,"Director Sean Baker, co-writing his fourth feature with Chris Bergoch, does some deft balancing of his own: His genuine admiration for these two women extends to their idiosyncrasies, yet they never become fools, whores, saints, or coots."
1024,evening-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,Doesn’t seem as if it would translate easily to the big screen. It hasn't.
1025,shopgirl-movie,Maitland McDonagh,38,"The willowy Danes' rich, melancholy characterization is sown in a barren field of snippy attitude and too-cool posturing, and the film's disingenuous air of bittersweet chic becomes deeply tiresome long before it's over."
1026,the-surrogate-movie,Nathan Rabin,91,"It might just be the most poignant, moving film ever made about one man's surprisingly noble efforts to get laid.  "
1027,the-artist-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Here is one of the most entertaining films in many a moon, a film that charms because of its story, its performances and because of the sly way it plays with being silent and black and white."
1028,the-gift-2015-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"All three leading performers are scarily convincing on the film's own tight, clammy terms."
1029,mississippi-grind-movie,Justin Chang,80,"For all the impressive authenticity of the various settings, it’s Gerry and Curtis’ continually evolving push-pull dynamic that deservedly takes centerstage here, in a picture driven far less by narrative incident than by its gently pulsing comic undercurrents and vivid contemplation of character."
1030,backstage-2000-movie,Nick Rutigliano,10,High-concept cinema this ain't.
1031,die-hard-2-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,20,"If your idea of a good time is watching a lot of stupid, unpleasant people insult and brutalize one another, this is right up your alley."
1032,your-highness-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"Gingival surgery would be more fun than watching this brain-draining, spirit-sucking attempt at a stoner spoof, which combines the cutting edge of frat-boy wit, the excitement of a mid-'80s made-for-TV action flick and the authenticity of a Renaissance Faire held in an abandoned field behind a Courtyard by Marriott. "
1033,the-last-lions-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"This nature documentary about the vanishing lions of Africa is not your children's ""Lion King."""
1034,rock-the-kasbah-movie,David Edelstein,20,"The air of mourning might have worked as a counterpoint to the silliness if Mitch Glazer’s script had smart gags, but as one-liner after one-liner misses its mark, you begin to feel sorry for Murray, who’s really too old to be playing a guy who has a little daughter (not granddaughter) and likes to get kinky with Kate Hudson as a raucous, Dolly Parton–style hooker-businesswoman."
1035,the-boy-next-door-movie,Steve Davis,30,"While Lopez carries off the overdone damsel-in-distress schtick somewhat credibly, Guzman fails to step up to the trickier role of her seducer and stalker. "
1036,the-invention-of-lying-movie,Ann Hornaday,70,"Like Gervais, the audience wants to see a struggle, which here comes down to whether unvarnished honesty or random acts of compassionate deceit will win the day. That alone makes for entertainingly high stakes."
1037,stolen-summer-movie,Chris Gore,70,"The story is enhanced by solid performances all around by Bonnie Hunt, Aidan Quinn and Kevin Pollack."
1038,house-on-haunted-hill-movie,Todd Doogan,0,"Lucky for you, it won't cost a thing to get up and walk out at any point after the credits."
1039,wonderland-movie,Jami Bernard,38,It's hard to care what really happened on Wonderland Ave. when the audience hates the neighborhood.
1040,mixed-nuts-movie,Staff (Not Credited),0,"Veteran comics like Steve Martin and Madeleine Kahn wrestle valiantly with the incoherent story and ham-fisted dialogue, but it's a losing battle all the way. [30 Dec 1994]"
1041,two-of-a-kind-movie,Staff (Not Credited),0,Infantile fantasy reuniting the stars of Grease.
1042,love-songs-movie,Kevin Thomas,70,An attractive and talented young cast brings this graceful film alive in all its tenderness and emotion.
1043,aladdin-movie,Olly Richards,100,The movie that brought a hip new sensibility to animated features and which still stands up in the age of Pixar and DreamWorks thanks largely to a blistering improv turn from Robin Williams.
1044,miracle-at-st-anna-movie,Todd McCarthy,20,"This is a sloppy stew in which the ingredients of battle action, murder mystery, little-kid sentiment and history lesson don't mix well."
1045,the-best-man-movie,David Ansen,70,"Funny, sentimental, cheerfully bawdy story of a wedding reunion that stirs up a hornet's nest of old loves, lusts and jealousies."
1046,out-of-the-dark-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,30,"Ornamenting its flimsy back story with assaultive sound effects and asinine behavior, Out of the Dark strains to shock."
1047,hereditary-movie,Rex Reed,25,"These days actors not only appear in bad movies, they are forced to produce their own flops themselves. Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne co-executive produced Hereditary. They deserve what they get, in spades."
1048,survivor-movie,Steve Macfarlane,12,"This is the kind of filmmaking that gets touted as ""workmanlike"" when it's really straight-laced to the point of tepidness."
1049,wristcutters-a-love-story-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"The whole film is cracked, but in a stylish, downtown way."
1050,valentine-movie,Gemma Files,10,"Valentine simply mines the same tired, predictable slasher-movie vein as everything else he's (Blanks) done thus far. Send this one back unopened."
1051,the-piano-movie,Anthony Lane,100,"The story worms further into the guts of Victorian experience than most historical dramas, because it aims at the most neglected aspect of that age, and the most alarmingly modern: its surrealism. [29 Nov 1993, p.148]"
1052,fast-furious-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,30,"Spends a lot of time advertising how exciting it is, without actually being exciting."
1053,i-declare-war-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,80,"The directors (Lapeyre also wrote the film) have gathered a terrific bunch of young actors for the film, which plays at times like a “Lord of the Flies” knockoff but also has something original to say."
1054,john-q-movie,Claudia Puig,63,One can excuse the movie's missteps and melodramatic moments in the greater interest of the strong statement it makes about our health care system.
1055,nights-in-rodanthe-movie,Joshua Katzman,30,This romantic stinker is one of those films in which every plot development becomes a life lesson and every gesture is weighted with significance.
1056,the-devils-own-movie,Desson Thomson,0,"The Devil's Own, which stars Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, is so epically awful, it's practically homeric."
1057,the-ridiculous-6-movie,Justin Chang,10,"The scenery ain’t bad but the laughs are tumbleweed-sparse in The Ridiculous 6, a Western sendup so lazy and aimless, it barely qualifies as parody."
1058,steel-magnolias-movie,David Ansen,30,"The densely populated movie, pumped up with unnecessary crowd scenes and a handful of utterly extraneous male characters, is as garish and busy as a TV game show. As directed by Herbert Ross, it is so intent on persuading the audience that it is having a heartwarming emotional experience you almost expect TelePrompTers to flash in the theater, instructing you to laugh and cry. [27 Nov 1989, p.92]"
1059,where-the-wild-things-are-movie,Josh Modell,91,"Spike Jonze has recently said in interviews that his chief goal ...was to try to capture the feeling of being 9. By that measure--by just about any measure, really--he succeeded wildly."
1060,fools-rush-in-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,A sour romantic comedy that arrives in theaters just in time to spoil Valentine's Day. Its plot is a catalog of unpleasantness. Its characters are repellent.
1061,i-kill-giants-movie,Glenn Kenny,63,"That the perspective this time is from a girl’s point of view rather than a boy’s is significant. At least it is in theory. The scripter is Joe Kelly, who, along with J.M. Ken Nimura, created the comic. It’s not a knock to note that the main creative talents behind the camera are male — the women of the cast are clearly imbuing their characterizations with what they know. But there’s still something about I Kill Giants that feels projected, a work more informed by empathy than experience. "
1062,blended-movie,Gary Goldstein,70,"It could have been a bit smarter and a lot shorter, but Blended, the third big-screen pairing for Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore (after ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""50 First Dates""), is a fun, often funny, largely enjoyable romp."
1063,wilson-movie,Richard Roeper,38,So many scenes in Wilson play as if they’re dropped in from a different genre.
1064,never-die-alone-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"If Never Die Alone had even a smidgeon of comic relief (or even, say, a bunch of zombies) to offset some of its relentlessly downbeat brutality, it might have been at best tolerable. But it doesn't, and it's not. "
1065,mr-magoriums-wonder-emporium-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"At its best, the movie makes you feel like a kindred spirit."
1066,buybust-movie,Clarence Tsui,80,"The veteran Philippine genre-meister's ultraviolent action blockbuster goes beyond easy moral binaries to highlight how Duterte's warped worldview has made monsters out of everyone from the police to the peddlers to the ordinary people in between, all of them doing the bloody bidding of a corrupt political class."
1067,the-mortal-instruments-city-of-bones-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones hopes to be the start of a new franchise for tweens and Twihards, but the twuth is this twash is anything but a twiumph. "
1068,finding-dory-movie,Anna King,80,"While Finding Dory is definitely the kind of visual pleasure we’ve come to expect from Pixar, its storyline doesn’t always reach the heights of inventiveness upon which the gigantic animation studio has built its reputation. The film lacks the psychological probing of Inside Out, the existential ponderings of Wall-E, the gentle, stoic sadness of Up."
1069,synchronicity-movie,Chuck Bowen,38,Writer-director Jacob Gentry's film has the emotional fatuousness of uncertain softcore erotica.
1070,juno-movie,David Denby,90,Juno is a coming-of-age movie made with idiosyncratic charm and not a single false note.
1071,behind-the-sun-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"Carvalho's superb cinematography, Antonio Pinto's score and a dedicated cast and crew admirably sustain this poetic and uncompromising film."
1072,beautiful-creatures-movie,Jan Stuart,10,Tedious and unfunny.
1073,30-beats-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"Everything that goes around comes around, but the roundelay in 30 Beats comes off, well, a little square."
1074,the-other-sister-movie,Gillian Flynn     ,25,"Still, there's no mistaking the central message: Slow people have much to teach us. Or is it: Slow people -- aren't they funny? Either way, it's pretty vile stuff."
1075,mr-deeds-movie,David Edelstein,10,"This is another of those post-Saturday Night Live vehicles in which ineptitude and laziness are supposed to be taken as irony: It's not bad, it's ""bad."" Actually, it's ""terrible"":"
1076,the-identical-movie,Michael Phillips,25,"Playing the title role as well as the Dream role, real-life Elvis tribute artist Blake Rayne is more convincing when he's singing than when he isn't. But he has little to explore beyond bashful smiles. "
1077,love-ranch-movie,Melissa Anderson,30,"Hackford's pacing throughout is continuously off, with scenes extending several beats too long, his two leads adrift and bored."
1078,the-boy-in-the-striped-pajamas-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,Told from a different angle than any other Holocaust film I've seen.
1079,double-take-2001-movie,Charles Savage,75,"Frenetic, maddening, exhilarating, ridiculous, fascinating farce of an action-comedy-thriller-mystery-whatever."
1080,the-final-year-movie,Jocelyn Noveck,63,"Despite being near the action, we don’t feel particularly close to it. Still, we get to see the wheels turning, and it’s hard not to get wrapped up in some of the backstage moments."
1081,bobby-jones-stroke-of-genius-movie,Connie Ogle,38,"Sluggish, uninspired drama. "
1082,the-kid-stays-in-the-picture-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"The movie's only discernible purpose is as publicity for the book. An admitted egomaniac, Evans is no Hollywood villain, and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of Don Simpson. Instead, he'll probably get an Irving Thalberg award."
1083,couples-retreat-movie,A.O. Scott,10,An R-rated version of this mess would be only more gratingly dishonest as it tried to hide its weak sentimentality behind a fig leaf of vulgarity.
1084,13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"Still, if 13 Hours lacks the gravitas of “American Sniper,” it’s powerful stuff. Bay’s goal is to put you right in these men’s boots, to feel the heat, the fear, the fatigue, the weight of the weapons and the web of camaraderie."
1085,attack-the-block-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"Attack the Block is the other alien-invasion movie opening today, the lousy one, the one from Britain. In Britain, it's probably just a regular bad movie, but here - with accents that are barely comprehensible and in-jokes about council flats, not to mention a swerving handheld camera and some of the cheapest effects since ""Night of the Lepus"" - it's surprising this thing ever got released."
1086,around-the-bend-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,"So programmatic, so dogged in hitting the right steps at the right time that it completely lacks spontaneity."
1087,beyond-borders-movie,Todd McCarthy,30,"Star-driven, high-minded claptrap that, fatally, can't even rig a rooting interest in its central love story. "
1088,marie-antoinette-movie,Peter Travers,88,"With lyrical intelligence and scrappy wit, Coppola creates a luscious world to get lost in. It's a pleasure."
1089,walking-and-talking-movie,Mike Clark,63,"But when material is this fragile, virtually every scene is obligated to click for the result to become something special. Ultimately, this walking and talking comes perilously close to becoming a gab-fest treadmill. [26 Jul 1996, Pg.04.D]"
1090,life-animated-movie,Clayton Dillard,12,It never addresses Disney's wholly manufactured stranglehold on turning adolescent desire into a consumerist impulse.
1091,phantom-thread-movie,Ty Burr,100,"Absurdly pleasurable to watch and to listen to, an effortless display of poise from its camerawork and costumes to the characters and the things they say."
1092,raiders!-the-story-of-the-greatest-fan-film-ever-made-movie,Eric Kohn,75,"While the documentary's structure is somewhat uneven, its protagonists remain fascinating subjects whose recollections — along with backstories fleshed out by their wives and parents — include revelations of much greater challenges than the movie itself."
1093,lovely-amazing-movie,Connie Ogle,88,"A film of this sort demands superb, seemingly effortless acting, and Holofcener gets it at every turn."
1094,urbania-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,Rarely does a movie come along that captures an aspect of everyday consciousness that has not yet made it onto film.
1095,taxi-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"In a film that is wall-to-wall idiocy, the most tiresome delusion is that car chases are funny."
1096,lawless-heart-movie,Phil Hall,30,About as funny as a funeral. 
1097,get-shorty-movie,Barbara Shulgasser,88,This movie is charming the way so few movies are anymore.
1098,k-19-the-widowmaker-movie,Anthony Lane,30,"A long, lumbering brute of a movie, no easier to maneuver than the vessel itself. [29 July 2002, p. 92]"
1099,cloud-atlas-movie,Claudia Puig,63,"The cinematography is gorgeous and the makeup amazing, but the story lines are too disconnected."
1100,fat-albert-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,11,"The movie is toothless and uninspired, and as directed by veteran filmmaker Joel Zwick (My Big Fat Greek Wedding), the film is a disgracefully shoddy affair."
1101,jupiter-ascending-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"While the totality of Jupiter Ascending is just too much for its own massive narrative heft to support, kudos to the Wachowskis for beating back against mainstream Hollywood by casting actors of all races and genders in key roles, something they’ve been doing since their 1996 debut ""Bound."" "
1102,8mm-movie,Kenneth Turan,0,"Those foolhardy enough to place themselves at the mercy of 8MM can expect the following emotions: disgust and revulsion, then anger, followed by a profound and disheartening sadness. There are some films whose existence makes the world a worse place to live, and this is one of them."
1103,the-dark-tower-movie,Justin Chang,20,"From start to finish, the movie exudes a stiff, joyless coherence."
1104,you-again-movie,Wesley Morris,12,This is another miserable movie about women at war over nonsense.
1105,spaceballs-movie,Rick Groen,38,"Candy and Moranis are real talents, but they're completely wasted, like everyone else here, sacrificed to the grade-school inanities of that self-indulgent script. [26 Jun 1987, p.D6]"
1106,closer-movie,William Arnold,67,"While its execution is fine, the movie is almost shockingly vapid."
1107,gigli-movie,Stephen Hunter,0,"Enervated, torpid, slack, dreary and, oh yes, nasty, brutish and long."
1108,when-we-first-met-movie,Lena Wilson,16,"Neither romantic nor comedic, When We First Met is almost too vapid to be aggravating. After watching it, you might be tempted to hunt down a time-traveling photo booth of your own so that you can undo your mistake. Luckily, this movie is so shallow you probably won’t even remember it after you wake up tomorrow"
1109,back-to-the-future-part-ii-movie,Richard Schickel,90,"It twists it, shakes it and stands it on its ear. But as before, the film's technical brilliance is the least of its appeals. Satirically acute, intricately structured and deftly paced, it is at heart stout, good and untainted by easy sentiment."
1110,twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me-movie,Jay Scott,0,"A two- hour-plus surrealistic bummer - it makes the audience feel as if it is coming down from a virulent drug. (The pacing, the images, the music and the endemic menace recall clinical descriptions of cocaine-induced paranoia.)...A disgusting, misanthropic movie."
1111,son-of-god-movie,Abhimanyu Das,12,The film plays for much of its length like a terrible sketch comedy with one-dimensional caricatures shuffling listlessly through a succession of stilted tableaux.
1112,the-master-of-disguise-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,"A gimmick in search of a movie: how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible, plot mechanics be damned."
1113,national-security-movie,William Arnold,67,"It's only a notch above the routine, and it obeys all the conventions of its tired formula, but it also tones the anarchy with a serious edge and it works a surprisingly effective vein of race-relations satire."
1114,wallace-gromit-the-curse-of-the-were-rabbit-movie,Roger Ebert,88,Wallace and Gromit are arguably the two most delightful characters in the history of animation.
1115,walk-hard-the-dewey-cox-story-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,"I loved both ""Walk the Line"" and ""Ray,"" but it will be hard to watch either one with a straight face again after the skewering they get in this Judd Apatow production, which quotes scene after scene to hilarious effect."
1116,the-abyss-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Both Mastrantonio and Harris are terrific, never missing a beat, always convincing, even when playing the most extreme emotions. [9 Aug 1989, Daily Datebook, p.E1]"
1117,lilya-4-ever-movie,Stephen Holden,90,The most remarkable achievement of the film is its presentation of Lilya's story as both an archetypal case study and a personal drama whose spunky central character you come to care about so deeply that you want to cry out a warning at each step toward her ruination.
1118,gold-movie,Blake Goble,33,"Gold is weakly written, predictable, and too placid to achieve any loftier ambitions. It’s just a soft-sold tale of a schemer’s paradise."
1119,spring-breakers-movie,Dana Stevens,30,"Any irregularity in tone becomes a part of the movie’s intentionally rough, imperfect surface — a formal strategy I might find interesting if I could make head or tail of what the movie that’s using it is trying to say."
1120,a-good-year-movie,Michael Sragow,67,"Apart from the movie's moments of flesh and fantasy, it lacks the lyric impulse that would make the swank fantasy take flight."
1121,whiskey-tango-foxtrot-movie,Melissa Anderson,10,"The mild Islamophobia and highly questionable casting choices in the film call to mind other texting abbreviations, namely AYFKMWTS and GTFOOH. In the end, though, it's an armed-forces acronym dating back to World War II that best describes this dismal project: FUBAR."
1122,the-hurricane-heist-movie,Alonso Duralde,10,"Do not shelter yourself from the silliness of The Hurricane Heist. Put down your umbrella, throw your arms open wide and get soaked with its idiocy."
1123,dancer-in-the-dark-movie,Ella Taylor,80,"I was astonished to find myself weeping copiously over von Trier's latest, which is another parable of monomaniacal sainthood."
1124,london-has-fallen-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,0,Perhaps the movie’s politics—which range from tone deaf to irredeemable—would be more of an issue if it weren’t so inept.
1125,the-grand-budapest-hotel-movie,Scott Tobias,90,"There’s nothing lost in his continued refinement of style; if anything, it makes the pleasures of his work that much more acute."
1126,cant-hardly-wait-movie,Marc Savlov,67,"Nobody's going to give this one an Oscar, sure, but as far as the venerable teen sex comedy goes, this one actually makes it to third base."
1127,a-night-at-the-roxbury-movie,Russell Smith,11,"What is love? Haddaway asks in the omnipresent soundtrack song. Not this time-wasting bilge, that's for sure. "
1128,the-armor-of-light-movie,Clayton Dillard,25,"It doesn't trust the inherently complex material to speak for itself or care to consider its consequences beyond instances of manufactured, gut-wrenching immediacy."
1129,knocked-up-movie,Ella Taylor,80,"Line for line, Knocked Up isn't quite as funny as ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" which got most of its laughs from the friction between prissy Carell and his sex-crazed stoner co-workers. But it is equally good as a nutty anthropology of marginal living and as an illustration of how much energy it takes to do nothing in a work-obsessed society."
1130,minority-report-movie,David Ansen,90,"Ferociously intense, furiously kinetic, it’s expressionist film noir science fiction that, like all good sci-fi, peers into the future to shed light on the present."
1131,flame-and-citron-movie,Peter Rainer,83,A pretty good example of the kind of movie Hollywood used to turn out by the yard.
1132,bigger-stronger-faster-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"While Bell makes the point that pros account for about 85 percent of total usage, he is more interested in why others - including a guy with the world's biggest biceps, who admits they repulse women - are so driven to be Bigger, Stronger, Faster."
1133,underworld-movie,Kevin Carr,30,There's too much pretension in this film. Lots of intense stares into the camera. Lots of uncomfortably hip clothes. Lots of pompous names for themselves.
1134,spirited-away-movie,Peter Bradshaw,100,Spirited Away is fast and funny; it's weird and wonderful. Mostly wonderful.
1135,hitman-movie,Todd McCarthy,10,"A Eurotrashy vidgame knockoff that misses its target by a mile. Numbingly unthrilling as it lurches from one violent encounter to another, the pic's dark roots in an electronic, non-dramatic medium are plain to see, and unsuspecting gamers lured to theaters will soon wish they were back home participating in the action themselves."
1136,garfield-movie,Marrit Ingman,0,"You'd have to be a real a..hole to hate this movie, loaded as it is with adorable animals. Sadly the task falls to me. "
1137,backwards-movie,Stephanie Merry,38,"The biggest problem, then, is the characters who populate the film. For the most part, they're one-dimensional caricatures."
1138,new-years-eve-movie,Melissa Anderson,10,"A movie so excruciating that it makes its predecessor, ""Valentine's Day,"" seem like ""Nashville"" in comparison."
1139,rock-the-kasbah-movie, Joe Neumaier,30,"Old-school Bill Murray, deadpan and gonzo, spices up the amiable mess that is Rock the Kasbah. That’s both a saving grace and a curse. Because while Murray and his laid-back riffs anchor this oil spill of a story, he needs a more tangible movie to latch onto, and all he gets is a mirage."
1140,an-american-werewolf-in-paris-movie,Stephen Hunter,0,"It's all too silly to bother. Without style and attitude, nothing gets old faster than horror."
1141,broken-arrow-movie,Rita Kempley,0,"Broken Arrow, a deafening, brain-deadening action thriller, takes a mighty blase approach to nuking Denver."
1142,the-dukes-of-hazzard-movie,Allison Benedikt,12,"Commenting on performances here is like critiquing the production design of a porno--it's beside the point. Briefly: Knoxville, bad choice, man. Reynolds, you make a good villain. Simpson, lovely posing. Scott, you're from Minnesota and it shows--but I bet stunt driving school was fun."
1143,the-boondock-saints-ii-all-saints-day-movie,Sam Adams,16,"Duffy's inept command of actors, not to mention his utterly juvenile morality and his comically clumsy use of religious iconography, should keep all but the diehards away."
1144,brand-upon-the-brain!-movie,Michael Phillips,88,The film is a singular achievement.
1145,italian-for-beginners-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"This is a woman's work in the best sense -- empathetic, inferentially erotic and delicately intuitive, as well as fiercely intelligent."
1146,the-squid-and-the-whale-movie,Scott Foundas,70,Pic makes up in strong performances and wry observation what it sometimes lacks in narrative drive. Result is a perceptive (and unexpectedly moving) portrait of lives in crisis.
1147,phantom-thread-movie,Tim Grierson,100,"Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson has crafted a period drama of startling tonal fluidity, and Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps deliver reserved performances that slowly reveal significant depth, transcending the material’s potential plight-of-the-artist clichés to hit at something far richer and more mysterious about desire, ambition and control."
1148,dracula-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"Oldman and Ryder and Hopkins pant with eagerness. The movie is an exercise in feverish excess, and for that if for little else, I enjoyed it."
1149,star-wars-episode-iii---revenge-of-the-sith-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"The darkest, most operatic, and technologically richest ""Star Wars"" movie to date, ""Sith"" is grim, stirring entertainment and a nearly complete vindication of everything its creator has been saying for six years about where the series was heading and what its final shape would be."
1150,a-midsummer-nights-sex-comedy-movie,Bill Cosford,75,"Woody Allen's new movie, A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, will not make you cry, as Annie Hall and Manhattan were capable of, and it won't make you cringe, as Stardust Memories almost demanded. It is not screamingly funny, romantically piquant, bitter or even, in most ways, unusual. With the exception of a single recurring image--that of Allen as an amateur inventor of the early 20th Century, flapping about in various homemade flying machines--there is not even anything of the absurd in this film. It's just an engaging Woody Allen movie, in which much of the humor is familiar and the tone is as moistly appealing as the title suggests. [18 July 1982, p.L3]"
1151,miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children-movie,Christy Lemire,38,"Because even though I’d just seen the exact same movie my son had, I wasn’t sure I completely understood it, either."
1152,jason-bourne-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,"Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Christopher Rouse, director Paul Greengrass has come up with a post-Snowden film that delivers nonstop thrills."
1153,show-dogs-movie,Steve Davis,0,Stupefyingly inane buddy-cop comedy.
1154,king-of-california-movie,Kyle Smith,38,A caper comedy that forgot to put in the laughs.
1155,kingdom-come-movie,Jonathan Foreman,25,"The characters are tired stereotypes, the sentimentality nauseating and the situation comedy way below the standards of the very worst WB or UPN shows."
1156,joe-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,100,"Nicolas Cage delivers what may his best, most nuanced performance yet in the gritty, hypnotic and deeply moving Joe."
1157,killing-them-softly-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,"This is a deliberately chilly and nerve-wracking experience, and one of the bleakest portraits of American society seen on-screen in the last several decades. "
1158,three-kings-movie,Lisa Alspector,90,"The visuals are wild, the sound track has the audacity to underscore the subtext instead of just echoing the obvious, the comedy is irreverent and occasionally slapstick, and the metaphorical details are consistently strong."
1159,driving-miss-daisy-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Beresford is able to move us, one small step at a time, into the hearts of his characters. He never steps wrong on his way to a luminous final scene in which we are invited to regard one of the most privileged mysteries of life, the moment when two people allow each other to see inside."
1160,basic-instinct-2-movie,James Berardinelli,25,"This film is unable to involve, entertain, or titillate. Basically, it stinks."
1161,little-black-book-movie,Robert Wilonsky,20,"It's a self-satisfied, self-loathing mess that demands you adore and cheer for the very person you come to hate well before its 105 minutes are up. Little Black Book will leave you feeling skuzzy. "
1162,the-expendables-3-movie,Claudia Puig,25,The Expendables 3 is as boneheaded and disposable as it sounds.
1163,badlands-movie,Tina Hassannia,100,"Where it’s not refined in form, Badlands is so by virtue of the specificity of its material (the then-topical sensationalism of teenage sociopaths and their glamorization in popular culture), a fact that has been buried by the dense literature published on Malick. Yet the film never once feels like the faded photos Holly examines under her father’s stereopticon."
1164,sarah-silverman-jesus-is-magic-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,The hot comic du jour wants to startle us but is merely startlingly dull.
1165,35-shots-of-rum-movie,Wesley Morris,88,"I liked these characters, and suddenly not having them in my life anymore, simply because Denis has decided to start the closing credits, devastated me."
1166,the-bad-batch-movie,April Wolfe,90,"No matter how confounding the story gets, details and humor ground the narrative, and a simple guiding premise about the importance of human connection and artistic expression fills in the blanks."
1167,rambo-movie,Steve Davis,30,"There will be blood in the ultraviolent Rambo, a movie that depicts both heinous acts and righteous reckoning with equal degrees of flying body parts and arterial sprays."
1168,cold-war-movie,Steve Pond,90,"If it doesn’t feel as fresh and bracing as “Ida” did, that film may have been the perfect combination of form and content. Cold War, which is Pawlikowski’s first entry in Cannes main competition, is in some ways more familiar, but the spin he puts on it is distinctly and beautifully his own creation."
1169,dunkirk-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,100,"Dunkirk isn’t comfortable to watch; it never relents or relaxes. At the same time, it’s impossible to look away from it."
1170,sully-movie,Nick Newman,75,"It basks in the rightness of those who work hard to get a proper result, simultaneously disinterested in reinventing the wheel and still finding some new ways to spin it."
1171,super-movie,Kimberley Jones,20,"There are kernels here of a thoughtful and provocative picture, but they never pop – or POP!, for that matter. "
1172,winters-tale-movie,Chris Cabin,12,"Fantasy is heavily dependent on vision, which Mark Helprin had in spades, but the look of Akiva Goldsman's fantasy is limp, timid, and occasionally outright awkward."
1173,just-go-with-it-movie,Roger Ebert,25,The people in this movie are dumber than a box of Tinkertoys. 
1174,darkness-falls-movie,Bruce Fretts,16,Darkness Falls is like something salvaged from Stephen King's wastebasket.
1175,layer-cake-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Things get a little tricky by the end, but it's the sort of trickery that's immensely satisfying."
1176,dumb-and-dumberer-when-harry-met-lloyd-movie,Ann Hornaday,10,"To call it sophomoric would libel even the most pathetic, pimply underclassman."
1177,the-taste-of-others-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,75,A charming little valentine to the mysteries of attraction.
1178,lost-souls-movie,Desson Thomson,10,A pretty dreary affair to sit through. It's not even scary.
1179,the-mummy-2017-movie,Rodrigo Perez,16,"The Mummy is a dated, empirically dismal, laughable excuse to kick off a franchise, and it should have remained entombed."
1180,life-itself-movie,Amber Wilkinson,80,This is an impressively clear-eyed and deeply moving portrait.
1181,harry-+-max-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,25,Too superficial to shock or surprise.
1182,the-lovers-movie,Rex Reed,0,An idiotic bore called The Lovers has so little connection with anything professional that it’s hard to believe it was written and helmed by the same man. It’s so deadly and unintentionally funny (I hope) that it practically defies description. 
1183,avengers-infinity-war-movie,Jake Coyle,63,It’s really the simple pleasure of seeing so many good actors together that makes “Infinity War” — an “Ocean’s Eleven” in hyper drive — work. 
1184,surviving-christmas-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"It's the sort of stupid swill that gets spewed out by a studio committee, slapped together without a brain, a heart, or a good idea about where to put a camera or when to cut a scene."
1185,sucker-punch-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"There is nothing here to enjoy, beyond the tiny satisfaction in noting that the movie lives up to its name. "
1186,gods-of-egypt-movie,Peter Travers,0,Some movies are so effing awful they're hilarious. Gods of Egypt falls short of that lofty goal. Not because it isn’t effing awful — it so is — but because it pretends to be in on the joke.
1187,ted-movie,Shawn Levy,75,"Ted may not be profound or deft, but when it hits the sweet-sour spot, which it does regularly, it can win you over."
1188,breakin-movie,Bill Cosford,63,"Though Breakin' follows the Flashdance formula as if it were blazed in concrete, working from a script that would make a 12-year-old snicker, it is so exuberant and lighthearted that it works. [09 May 1984, p.B5]"
1189,kon-tiki-movie,Ty Burr,63,Kon-Tiki is stalwart and uplifting and there are passing moments of wonder.
1190,miss-pettigrew-lives-for-a-day-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Adams shines brightly, reinforcing the image she projected in Junebug and enhanced in Enchanted and Charlie Wilson's War. At this time of the year, it's tough to find a more diverting way to spend 90 minutes in a multiplex."
1191,chevalier-movie,Boyd van Hoeij,80,"Just like a cubist painting, what happens in the film doesn’t necessarily resemble real life in a narrow documentary sense but instead gives the viewer something else: a chance to consider certain behavior from various sides and on a more abstract level."
1192,the-interrupters-movie,Richard Corliss,90,Matthews brings to The Interrupters what every terrific documentary needs: an out-of-nowhere personality with the same magnetic watchability as any Hollywood star.
1193,american-gangster-movie,Jack Mathews,63,The problem is that the movie spends as much time on the boring detective chasing Lucas as on the drug lord himself.
1194,o-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,Exceptionally intelligent and powerful contemporary adaptation.
1195,the-last-detail-movie,Vikram Murthi,100,"There’s a deep sense of melancholy and finality that runs through The Last Detail even when it’s at its funniest, not just because of Meadows’ fate, but because of Buddusky and Mulhall’s collective guilt for being part of a system that would dole out such a punishment. "
1196,double-take-2001-movie,Tom Keogh,0,"It's not just bad, it's ugly. Not just stupid but really aesthetically displeasing. The sooner this movie disappears from sight, the better."
1197,queen-and-country-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"The story is minimal, just a series of events in the life of a young man and his circle, but every scene is rendered with such authenticity that it’s riveting, almost like it’s a privilege to be stepping back in time."
1198,when-in-rome-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,How do movies this bad still get made?
1199,scooby-doo-movie,Connie Ogle,38,"The best thing you can say about Scooby-Doo is that Matthew Lillard makes a really, really good Shaggy."
1200,pulp-fiction-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,100,"Tarantino's mock-tough narrative--which derives most of its titillation from farcical mayhem, drugs, deadpan macho monologues, evocations of anal penetration, and terms of racial abuse--resembles a wet dream for 14-year-old male closet queens (or, perhaps more accurately, the 14-year-old male closet queen in each of us), and his command of this smart-alecky mode is so sure that this nervy movie sparkles throughout with canny twists and turns."
1201,get-out-movie,Tasha Robinson,92,"Like so much of Key & Peele’s comedy, Get Out is refreshing in its naked, frank aggression about confronting racial issues, with comedy, drama, and sharp, unsparing insight."
1202,beyond-the-sea-2004-movie,Phil Hall,10,Such a hopeless mess that there's no fun in tossing insults at its endless shortcomings.
1203,harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-movie,Colin Bertram,100,"It's action-packed, darker, more epic and thankfully schmaltz-free. And it's the best ""Harry Potter"" film yet."
1204,empire-movie,Desson Thomson,10,Doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is.
1205,7-minutes-movie,Clayton Dillard,0,"Whether because of race, shame, shelter, or fright, 7 Minutes remains white in the face throughout."
1206,the-lazarus-effect-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,30,"Despite eclectic casting and occasional experiments with objective camera, the director, David Gelb (“Jiro Dreams of Sushi”), can’t breathe similar life into this risible mix of pseudoscientific hokum and supernatural freakouts."
1207,ballistic-ecks-vs-sever-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"The film isn't even as good as the second-rate game it is based on, which is nothing but a shootout."
1208,any-given-sunday-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"A football film made by a man who apparently has seen little of the game outside of movies, and not very good ones at that."
1209,skyfall-movie,Kim Newman,80,"Skyfall is pretty much all you could want from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately."
1210,love-and-death-on-long-island-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,90,"A witty, canny meditation on the power of pop culture in general and the rationalizations of cinephilia and film criticism in particular. "
1211,american-wedding-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,"For sheer ineptitude, crassness and unwatchability, American Wedding takes the cake."
1212,brother-movie,David Rooney,30,The mix feels flat and the story remains a fairly banal account of underworld exploits whose emotional gears never fully engage.
1213,the-story-of-us-movie,David Ansen,30,So bland and un-lived in you want to pour Tabasco all over the screen.
1214,a-sound-of-thunder-movie,Michael Esposito,25,One redeeming feature of this picture is that it will make great fodder for those make-fun-of-the-movie TV shows.
1215,jodorowskys-dune-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,Grandly entertaining documentary.
1216,undead-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,On the level of a no-budget student film in which the shots barely match up into sequences. It's about as much fun as watching blood dry.
1217,nebraska-movie,Peter Bradshaw,80,"Nebraska may not be startlingly new, and sometimes we can see the epiphanies looming up over the distant horizon; the tone is, moreover, lighter and more lenient than in earlier pictures like Sideways. But it is always funny and smart."
1218,deliver-us-from-evil-2014-movie,Jordan Hoffman,20,"This is television-level moviemaking top to bottom, from its preposterous premise, scenery-chomping performances, idiotic sound cues and force-fed jump-scares. Deliver Us From Evil delivers formula, and in a formulaic fashion."
1219,flight-movie,Michael Phillips,100,"Flight is exciting - terrific, really - because in addition to the sophisticated storytelling techniques by which it keeps us hooked, it doesn't drag audience sympathies around by the nose, telling us what to think or how to judge the reckless, charismatic protagonist played by Denzel Washington."
1220,gods-and-monsters-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,88,"It has the most beautiful ending of any American film in years, a coda of reconciliation and remembrance set in a gentle L.A. rain."
1221,four-christmases-movie,Kyle Smith,12,The movie boasts five Oscar winners. That figure exceeds by five the number of times I laughed at this cheap collection of icky jokes.
1222,the-divergent-series-allegiantpart-1-movie,Julia Cooper,25,"Try as I might, I cannnot activate your interest in this bloated excuse for a movie."
1223,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,A.O. Scott,0,"It may be a bit early to make such judgments, but Battlefield Earth may well turn out to be the worst movie of this century."
1224,hello-i-must-be-going-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"Abbott has a compelling unpredictability, though, and in a couple of his scenes with Lynskey, you can spot the stirrings of a more complex film than the one we finally ended up with. "
1225,holy-smoke-movie,Paula Nechak,83,"It's a funny, insightful film whose feminist undertones don't overwhelm the story and characters."
1226,rbg-movie,Joe Morgenstern,70,What makes the film valuable is its focus on Justice Ginsburg as a champion of women’s rights.
1227,mayor-of-the-sunset-strip-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,90,"This may sound an eensy bit hyperbolic, but dig: Mayor of the Sunset Strip is the greatest rock-and-roll movie of all time."
1228,chasing-papi-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"So resoundingly awful, there may be grounds to sue for mental suffering."
1229,in-the-cut-movie,Rene Rodriguez,38,"The movie is all moist grime and seedy atmosphere, and it's certainly something to look at: It's beautifully lurid. But it's an empty, unengaging movie, and by the end, it has become ridiculous, too."
1230,lost-in-la-mancha-movie,J.R. Jones,80,The equation of Gilliam with Quixote is so obvious to everyone involved that Fulton and Pepe can hardly be blamed for adopting it.
1231,signs-movie,David Sterritt,25,"It's encouraging to see Hollywood tackle themes of faith and religion, but here, too, Shyamalan is timid, reducing them to fuzzy New Age clichés. Add wooden acting, stilted dialogue, and a faux-arty style, and you have a thudding disappointment."
1232,sing-movie,David Ehrlich,16,Sing is the Platonic ideal of an Illumination movie. It’s a profoundly soulless piece of work that shines a light on the mediocrity they foist upon the children of the world.
1233,walking-tall-movie,Jonathan Foreman,63,"Exciting stuff in its primitive, predictable way."
1234,spring-breakers-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"The movie is wild, but not in the ways that you expect, and it’s also surprisingly chaste — you think you see a lot more than you actually do."
1235,alfie-movie,Megan Lehmann,38,This Alfie has been castrated.
1236,scary-movie-2-movie,Dennis Lim,10,The Wayans brothers' new bottom-feeder signals its utter exhaustion -- and barely veiled contempt for the audience.
1237,transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-movie,Peter Travers,0,Transformers 2 has a shot at the title Worst Movie of the Decade.
1238,a-love-affair-of-sorts-movie,John DeFore,10,"""Just to document yourself being bored is very boring,"" Enci says at one point. It's one moment of fiction here that rings all too true."
1239,obvious-child-movie,Steve Macfarlane,75,"Whatever your foreknowledge of low-budget Brooklyn dramedies, it's impossible that Gillian Robespierre's film won't lob you at least a few curveballs."
1240,dirty-grandpa-movie,Roger Moore,25,"It’s exactly what the title portrays it to be — “Grandpa” Robert DeNiro, as potty-mouthed, oversexed and politically incorrect as he’s ever been."
1241,tell-no-one-movie,Reyhan Harmanci,75,"It just does everything really well: perfect pacing, lovely camera work, spot-on acting and an ingenious plot."
1242,antichrist-movie,Matthew Sorrento,10,If only von Trier could work beyond the poster art concept. Antichrist stubbornly fails as a gothic nightmare and meanders as a misanthropic two-character drama.
1243,the-bourne-ultimatum-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,90,Audiences will eat it up: This is a postmillennial spy-action movie pitched to a large international audience. You hardly need subtitles.
1244,my-neighbor-totoro-movie,Steve Rose,100,"Hayao Miyazaki's family fantasy is full of benign spirituality, prelapsarian innocence, but little icky sentiment."
1245,crimson-peak-movie,Sara Stewart,63,"Chastain and Wasikowska take center stage while Hiddleston flutters around like one of Allerdale’s huge black moths. Watching the women square off within del Toro’s eye-popping, painterly palette is a feast for the eyes, if not particularly substantial fare for the mind."
1246,duck-butter-movie,Greg Cwik,63,"The setup of a 24-hour relationship that bypasses the getting-to-know-you phase speaks to the nature of expedited modern dating culture, but despite its attempts at intimacy, Duck Butter is difficult to fall in love with."
1247,hillarys-america-the-secret-history-of-the-democratic-party-movie,Frank Scheck,0,"Utterly lacking nuance and any sense of proportion, the irresponsible film depicts Democrats not as possessing misguided political ideas but rather as ""depraved crooks"" and ""hateful people."""
1248,the-pacifier-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"With no real comedy to enjoy, it's torture to watch Diesel undergo a predictable change from emotionless soldier to loving family man. Makes you want to spit out your pacifier in disgust."
1249,gimme-shelter-2014-movie,Sara Stewart,25,A clunky movie that feels as if it’s underwritten by the Roman Catholic Church.
1250,bossa-nova-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,30,"Sits before us like an exquisite platter of wax fruit, colorful, flavorless, and, if you eat it, very likely to come back up."
1251,pearl-harbor-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Littered with low points -- lame comedy, dubious history, fumbling drama and a love story so inept as to make a pacifist long for war."
1252,deconstructing-harry-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,This runs a close second to September as his worst feature to date--marginally more bearable only because it's a comedy and a couple of gags are reasonably funny.
1253,win-win-movie,Mike Scott,75,"The kind of indie gem that doesn't come around nearly often enough -- and, when they do, often not enough people go to see them. "
1254,cry-the-beloved-country-movie,Kevin Thomas,70,"Fortunately, in image and structure Roodt and Harwood go for a steadfast simplicity that builds to a beautiful moment of rekindled faith for the grieving Rev. Kumalo that lifts Cry, the Beloved Country to a climactic moment of redemption."
1255,man-push-cart-movie,Nathan Rabin,75,Quietly heartbreaking.
1256,the-widow-of-saint-pierre-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"The subtle selectivity of Leconte's eye, how he moves with great control from gesture to gesture, is matched by the disciplined intensity of the performances."
1257,the-wedding-ringer-movie,Jason Clark,25,"The Wedding Ringer is such a crudely edited, slapdash affair it often forgets about the characters it has introduced — especially the women."
1258,the-majestic-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,May just be the most boring movie ever made; certainly it's the most boring movie I've suffered through to the bitter end.
1259,il-divo-movie,Scott Tobias,67,"Through Sorrentino's lens, Andreotti's chief lieutenants are made to look like Reservoir Dogs, with Andreotti as a calm, tight-lipped, upper-crust analog to Lawrence Tierney."
1260,the-invisible-circus-movie,Dennis Lim,30,"A more intuitive writer-director could have extracted a credible study of time-warped bereavement from Jennifer Egan's extensively praised novel, but Adam Brooks's turgid adaptation merely emphasizes the book's stiff contrivances and wobbly characterizations."
1261,waitress-movie,Liam Lacey,75,"Waitress is sweet, uneven and, ultimately, a heartbreaker."
1262,war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"The film could have been improved by dropping a few battles, and I wish Caesar were not the only ape with the power of human speech. I, for one, would love to hear what Maurice the orangutan sounds like spouting the King’s English. "
1263,last-orders-movie,Peter Rainer,90,The lifelong friends in Fred Schepisi's marvelous Last Orders actually seem like lifelong friends.
1264,page-one-a-year-inside-the-new-york-times-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,75,"What is their passion for? Not newspapers, or even a single newspaper, per se, but for journalism itself, the practice of which is nowhere stronger than at the Times. That, at least, is how Page One argues it. It's a compelling argument."
1265,mcqueen-movie,Leah Greenblatt,83,"If McQueen feels like it’s missing some deeper insights, it may be because its subject kept so much of himself hidden from even the people who loved him most.... What’s left is a fascinating if incomplete portrait of genius interrupted — and a life that should have lasted much longer than it did."
1266,anomalisa-movie,Richard Roeper,100,"Even though it is a highly stylized, stop-motion animation film featuring puppet-like human characters, it is a pinpoint-accurate encapsulation of some of the most banal AND some of the most exhilarating moments virtually all of us have experienced at some point in our lives."
1267,step-movie,Moira Macdonald,100,The film is inspiring and funny and lovely.
1268,love-is-all-you-need-movie,Roger Moore,63,"It works, after a fashion — a romance that isn’t a romantic comedy. But Bier, a wonderful director, proves that “Love” isn’t all you need to make us swoon. You need a lighter touch."
1269,no-one-lives-movie,John DeFore,10,"When a slasher pic can't exploit a woodchipper for more sadistic thrills than we get here, it shouldn't expect moviegoers to salivate for a sequel."
1270,lady-in-the-water-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"This cloying piece of claptrap sets a high-water mark for pomposity, condescension, false profundity and true turgidity -- no small accomplishment for the man whose last two features were the deadly duo ""Signs"" and ""The Village."""
1271,ghost-rider-movie,Keith Phipps,33,"Cage has some fun with the role, making Blaze a kind of Zen Elvis with a strange fixation on Carpenters songs, but the film's priorities lie with the digital effects and not the story, and even the effects aren't that hot."
1272,dunkirk-movie,Peter Travers,100,Dunkirk is a landmark with the resonant force of an enduring screen classic.
1273,wonder-woman-movie,Dana Stevens,80,This is a movie about battling evil that pauses to ask what evil is and whether it’s necessary to understand its nature in order to defeat it.
1274,orgazmo-movie,Liam Lacey,25,"Pretty limp, and works far better in theory than practice."
1275,the-limey-movie,Edward Guthmann,100,A first-rate crime thriller and further proof that Soderbergh is one of our great contemporary film stylists.
1276,cold-comfort-farm-movie,Mike Clark,88,"Who, though, would assume rambunctious humor would be served up as well? Dickens meets the Beverly Hillbillies, and the movie is handsome, too. [10 May 1996, p.4D]"
1277,a-little-bit-of-heaven-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,Terminal colon cancer has never looked more fetching than in the critically ill romantic-disease comedy A Little Bit of Heaven. 
1278,the-salton-sea-movie,Steven Rea,75,"A slick, stylish hardboiled caper filtered through a druggy haze and borrowing a bit of a ""Memento"" revenge motif and ""Pulp Fiction"" playfulness."
1279,radio-movie,Sara Brady,38,"Both Harris and Gooding, Jr. are fine actors trapped in a mawkish, pandering production that wastes the latter and is a waste of time for the former."
1280,the-science-of-sleep-movie,Glenn Kenny,88,"It's not likely you'll see a film more visually exhilarating until, well, Gondry's next."
1281,the-purge-movie,Kerry Lengel,20,"The Purge is one of those unimaginative horror flicks that depend on skreeky music and sudden appearances to startle, but never actually frighten, the audience. The characters are undeveloped, the twists clumsily telegraphed and unsurprising."
1282,the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-3d-movie,Wesley Morris,12,All the makers of Texas Chainsaw 3D cared about was getting your $16.
1283,passengers-2016-movie,Bilge Ebiri,30,"It would be easy to call Passengers out for its troublesome sexual politics or its way-too-predictable genre contrivances, but really, that’d be giving it too much credit. The problem lies deeper, in the fact that it’s a clever set-up in search of an execution."
1284,soul-kitchen-movie,J.R. Jones,90,"Akin perfectly captures the antic pace, eccentric personalities, and fickle fortunes of the restaurant game, and his vision of the Soul Kitchen as an all-night bacchanal is irresistible."
1285,vacation-2015-movie,Chris Nashawaty,67,What’s missing is the pent-up anger that simmered behind Chevy Chase’s doofus grin. His Clark was always on the verge of a nuclear-family meltdown. Helms lacks Chase’s passive-aggressive edginess. 
1286,hector-and-the-search-for-happiness-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Even with appearances by such dependable performers as Toni Collette, Stellan Skarsgård, Christopher Plummer and Jean Reno, the interminable Hector and the Search for Happiness will most likely inspire audiences to search for the exit door."
1287,return-to-me-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,"If you get past the preposterous hypothesis at the start of Return to Me, you'll find a passably pleasant, utterly bland romantic comedy without a surprise to its 110 minutes."
1288,terminal-movie,Clint Worthington,25,"Drawing from a host of late-nineties influences but doing nothing with them, Terminal is little more than a shallow exercise in dated crime movie pastiche."
1289,little-miss-sunshine-movie,Peter Rainer,83,A prime example of a dysfunctional-family comedy that also doubles as a road movie. Even the vehicle of transport is dysfunctional.
1290,max-2015-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"Dullness, as well as hoary preachiness, neuters the family-and-their-war-dog drama Max."
1291,play-misty-for-me-movie,Staff (Not Credited),75,"A superior thriller, Play Misty For Me proved that popular actor Eastwood could direct himself in a film, concentrate on every aspect of the production from the visuals to the performances, and complete the shooting ahead of schedule and under budget. What he delivered was an engrossing study of how loneliness and longing can be transformed into irrational rage after a thoughtless act of selfish indulgence. Much of the credit must go to Jessica Walter for her outstanding performance which somehow manages to be chilling while at the same time sympathetic."
1292,the-change-up-movie,Ian Buckwalter,20,"The Change-Up's spin on the material transplants the same old house on a crumbled foundation, trying to disguise its creaky familiarity with the gaudiest coat of paint possible. "
1293,logan-lucky-movie,Chris Nashawaty,83,"A fizzy, twisty Southern-fried heist flick that’s more enjoyable the less you try to dissect it."
1294,mr-woodcock-movie,Maitland McDonagh,38,It goes without saying that the humor is vulgar and juvenile.
1295,predators-movie,Claudia Puig,63,Alice Braga plays an Army sniper uniquely familiar with jungle fighting. She is the only one of the crew who does any soul-searching to figure out why this particular group was chosen as prey.
1296,killer-of-sheep-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"Seeing Killer of Sheep is an experience as simple and indelible as watching Bresson's ""Pickpocket"" or De Sica's ""Bicycle Thieves"" for the first time. Despite its aesthetic debt to European art cinema, Burnett's film is quintessentially American in its tone and subject matter. If there's any modern-day equivalent for the movie's matter-of-fact gaze on the ravages of urban poverty, it's the HBO series ""The Wire."""
1297,games-people-play-new-york-movie,Kevin Thomas,20,"Whitney takes having it both ways to new heights -- depths is perhaps more like it. He satirizes reality TV while showing total nudity and at times carrying sex to the verge of soft-core porn. As titillating and energetic as the film is, it is also rather sad because it reveals what aspiring actors will endure for what they apparently regard as an opportunity."
1298,the-witness-movie,Barbara VanDenburgh,80,"Even more than an expose of bad reporting and social hysteria, The Witness is an intimate exercise in grief and healing"
1299,unleashed-movie,Benjamin Strong,10,Cloying dreck.
1300,my-life-in-ruins-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,11,"All ends happily for everyone in the movie, but for those in the audience, the experience is so hackneyed that they'll come out feeling like they're wearing shirts that say, ""I went to the Acropolis, but all I got was this lousy T-shirt."""
1301,elvis-nixon-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"Given the high quotient of hypotheticals in the story line, Nixon & Elvis can’t really be said to add to the historical record, but it’s an entertaining, deadpan jape that, with a bit of tweaking, could probably work as a stage play."
1302,client-9-the-rise-and-fall-of-eliot-spitzer-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Deepens the saga of New York's former governor and attorney general into the paradoxical morality play it really was. Spitzer, almost three years after he was caught soliciting escorts, comes off as chastened but still regal, like a hawkeyed Jewish Kennedy. "
1303,lost-found-movie,Paula Nechak,16,Funny for 15 minutes and then fades into mean-spirited cruelty and stupidity.
1304,the-ugly-truth-movie,Peter Travers,12,"Toss this ugly-ass crap to the curb, along with the other multiplex garbage, and see a romance that gets it right. I'm talking ""(500) Days of Summer."""
1305,delicacy-1969-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,63,It is Markus's sensitivity to nuance and to the feelings of others that characterizes every step that he - and this sure-footed if off-kilter film - takes. 
1306,gravity-movie,Oliver Lyttelton,100,"Gravity is about as visceral an experience as you can have in a cinema, it’s a technical marvel, and it’s a blockbuster with heart and soul in spades."
1307,norm-of-the-north-movie,Roger Moore,38,The result is a Save the Planet comedy that plays much longer than its 86 minutes.
1308,bringing-out-the-dead-movie,Jack Mathews,88,"It's a slice of life, with all the trimmings, and one of the strongest films of the year."
1309,the-muppets-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"Unfortunately, this comeback movie, a labor of love for mush-headed screenwriter and star Jason Segel, errs on the side of sweetness and nostalgia; except for a few good zingers from balcony dwellers Statler and Waldorf, there isn't much here for mom and dad."
1310,who-is-cletis-tout-movie,Scott Foundas,10,"A convoluted comic caper that labors to affect a lighthearted, off-the-cuff feel, and winds up being a copy of a copy of a bad Tarantino-Elmore Leonard forgery, with Tim Allen as a glib cinephile hitman."
1311,get-over-it-movie,Ernest Hardy,20,"A lobotomized updating of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."""

1315,somewhere-in-time-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"A charming, witty, passionate romantic drama about a love transcending space and time, Somewhere In Time is an old-fashioned film in the best sense of that term. Which means it's carefully crafted, civilized in its sensibilities, and interested more in characterization than in shock effects."
1316,get-carter-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"So minimally plotted that not only does it lack subtext or context, but it also may be the world's first movie without even a text."
1317,speed-racer-movie,Carina Chocano,30,"The fakeness of it all overwhelms, dampening any real excitement. It's hard to care about characters so stiff and one-dimensional they out-cartoon the cartoon originals, and it's hard to watch them bop around like avatars in a flat, airless, digital world."
1318,mortdecai-movie,Peter Sobczynski,12,One of those rare birds that is so off-putting in so many ways that all I could do for the most part was wonder how so many presumably intelligent people could be persuaded to sign on to produce and appear in something that could not have possibly seemed like anything other than a total mess from its earliest stages.
1319,bronson-movie,Stephen Farber,30,"Despite the artistic flourishes, this is still an utterly repellent look at a psychopath who does not deserve the attention of the filmmakers or the audience."
1320,robot-stories-movie,Karen Karbo,83,The subtext is singular: The presence of potentially dehumanizing technology serves to make the characters seem more human.
1321,duplex-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"This is a one-note deal, and it doesn't take long before you want to, well, just move out and leave these characters in their rent-controlled limbo. "
1322,oblivion-movie,Mark Feeney,63,"Oblivion is a lot like its star: clean, cold, efficient, increasingly overblown, and not a little inexplicable."

1324,law-abiding-citizen-movie,Cliff Doerksen,30,"Generally I don’t mind a little recreational fascism as long as it’s deep-fried in savory violent vengeance, but this overwrought mess gives vigilantism a bad name."
1325,the-captive-2014-movie,David Rooney,20,"The plotting here is so hopelessly tangled, clichéd, and bereft of psychological complexity that it's difficult to care what happens to any of these people."
1326,45-years-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"The devastating truth of 45 Years, so beautifully wrought, is that even the most devoted couples are made up of two people who are essentially alone. "
1327,manhattan-night-movie,Rex Reed,25,"Although it has a calm and intriguing noir-ish style (up to a point), there is nothing lucid enough to recommend about Manhattan Night, including the film itself."
1328,tokyo-godfathers-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"A spellbinding piece of Japanese anime from one of the form's new masters, director-writer Satoshi Kon."
1329,the-brothers-grimm-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,"The film seems almost intentionally bad in most ways, as if Gilliam were expressing a suicide wish for his directing career."
1330,pirate-radio-movie,Shawn Levy,8,"Witless, tasteless, toothless, pointless, garish, repetitive, obvious, and painfully dull, Pirate Radio is that exceedingly rare film that never, but never puts a foot right."
1331,wanted-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"Bekmambetov revs it up furiously and unleashes one bit of hyperactive, dazzling invention after another. The result is a throwaway wrapped up in the coolest packaging imaginable, which is acres better than the opposite."
1332,best-laid-plans-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"Sadly, a film about betrayal is ultimately betrayed by the film maker's own lack of conviction."
1333,going-in-style-movie,Michael Phillips,63,"Going in Style stays in the safe zone every second, nervous about risking any audience discomfort, as opposed to Brest's quietly nervy ode to old age and its discontents. Times change."
1334,company-man-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"It's an arch, awkward, ill-timed, forced political comedy set in 1959 and seemingly stranded there."
1335,pride-2014-movie,Odie Henderson,88,"The Brits do this type of crowd-pleaser far better than Hollywood, if only because films like “The Full Monty” and “Billy Elliot” were unafraid to temper sweetness with darker elements of reality."
1336,broken-horses-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"Notable Bollywood producer-director Vidhu Vinod Chopra makes a highly uneasy transition to American films with this weirdly baroque modern-day Western that, while it boasts undeniably imaginative visual and plot flourishes, is far too absurd to take seriously."
1337,the-edge-of-heaven-movie,David Edelstein,90,The Edge of Heaven is powerfully unsettled--it comes together by not coming together.

1339,jodorowskys-dune-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,75,"An account of a film that was never made despite all the love that its makers poured into it, yet somehow it's warm and inspirational: a call to arms for dreamers everywhere.  "
1340,dumb-and-dumber-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"An abominable, abdominal comedy. Aside from its tastelessness and dawdling pace, the movie’s chief problem is the lackluster chemistry between leading lummoxes Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels."
1341,body-of-lies-movie,Scott Foundas,80,"Its generic attributes (and title) notwithstanding, Scott's film may be the sharpest of all the post-9/11 thrillers--and also the most purely entertaining--in the way it maps the vectors and currents of the modern intelligence-gathering game without losing us in its dense narrative thicket."
1342,step-up-all-in-movie,Boyd van Hoeij,30,It is unlikely that a lot of viewers come to see a Step Up film for convincing dialogue or psychological insight into a group of young things trying to make it big in a ruthless industry. But there’s barely any humor that doesn’t feel third-rate and most of the plot threads are so thin that All In occasionally feels like a satire of a dance film.
1343,the-boondock-saints-ii-all-saints-day-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"Isn't for everyone, obviously; it might not be for anyone, come to think of it."
1344,a-perfect-world-movie,Jeff Shannon,88,"Despite a slightly relaxed first hour and forgivably minimal lapses in credibility, debut screenwriter John Lee Hancock has crafted an ultimately satisfying study of fate and circumstance that is worthy of its superstar showcase. [24 Nov 1993, p.E1]"
1345,the-big-bang-movie,Rex Reed,0,"With eyes closed and jaw firmly set, concentrating hard enough to break a blood vessel, I cannot think of a movie more incomprehensible, moronic, pointless or abominable than a load of trash called The Big Bang."
1346,the-eagle-movie,J. Hoberman,80,"The Eagle is full of action and fleet of foot-it's a movie of smoky, lowering battlefields and trippy, space-bending flashbacks, pausing only for admiring location shots of Scotland's wild, craggy vistas."
1347,howls-moving-castle-movie,Glenn Kenny,100,"The plot is pretty convoluted, but Miyazaki has a very good handle on it and lavishes his customary heart, humor, and inventiveness on every situation he depicts."
1348,gold-movie,Roger Moore,38,The film lacks the spark of life or wit that might have made it work.
1349,nick-and-norahs-infinite-playlist-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"Plays like something crafted in a lab by 54-year-old hucksters trying to sell shit to the kids under the cheerless guise of ""alternative."" The only thing it's an alternative to? Good."
1350,year-by-the-sea-movie,Jose Solís,67,"Joan’s peculiar kind of charm is mostly owed to Allen, who gives what might be the most complex, layered performance of her career."
1351,play-it-to-the-bone-movie,Kellam Eanes,10,"Despite some redeemable comic dialog between Banderas and Harrelson, most of the movie is TKO."
1352,young-adam-movie,Derek Elley,80,"All of the promise that was evident in Scottish helmer David Mackenzie's flawed freshman feature, ""The Last Great Wilderness"" (2002), is richly achieved in his second pic, Young Adam, a resonant, beautifully modulated relationships drama. "
1353,fracture-movie,James Berardinelli,75,Gruesomely engaging.

1356,eighth-grade-movie,Chris Nashawaty,100,"Eighth Grade is an absolute delight that stings with truth. It’s heartbreaking, heartwarming, and a total charmer. "
1357,disclosure-movie,Staff (Not Credited),75,"The screenplay is a distinct improvement on Crichton's one-dimensional, humorless potboiler.  The movie comes closest to thematic coherence in its depiction of something nearly everyone can relate to: the office from hell."
1358,loving-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"Loving is a decent and heartfelt movie that, rarity of rarity these days, suffers from being too decent and heartfelt. It is so careful not to give offense that, in some ways, it’s more admirable for what it doesn’t do than for what it does. "
1359,divergent-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Woodley, through the delicate power of her acting, does something compelling: She shows you what a prickly, fearful, yet daring personality looks like when it's nestled deep within the kind of modest, bookish girl who shouldn't even like gym class."
1360,spawn-movie,Laura Miller,0,"The special effects look model-shop cheesy, as if they'd been created using a handful of action figures and MacPaint, and the rest of the picture has the flat visual finish and phoned-in performances of a TV movie."
1361,the-slaughter-rule-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,75,"What it offers are dozens of intimate moments that feel so true, they achieve a rare kind of grace. This sensitive indie drama was written and directed by brothers - and first-time feature filmmakers."
1362,dave-chappelles-block-party-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Most fun of all, however, is basking in Chappelle's ability to be effortlessly funny. Whether he's making believe he's a pimp in a Dayton clothing store or charming little kids in the Bed-Stuy day-care center that was concert headquarters, his personality infuses the film with infectious good feelings."
1363,dumb-and-dumber-to-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"From junky production values to the parade of unfunny supporting characters to its lazy energy, Dumb and Dumber To falls on its face."
1364,nights-in-rodanthe-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"Most of the laughs are unintentional, but the result is absurd and laughable."

1366,bringing-out-the-dead-movie,David Ansen,90,Full of bravura moments and high-wire performances.
1367,biutiful-movie,Melissa Anderson,10,"Though its structure may be whittled down in comparison with the earlier works, Biutiful is even more morbidly obese than ""Babel"" in terms of soggy ideas, elephantine with miserabilist humanism and redemption jibber-jabber."
1368,house-of-flying-daggers-movie,Lawrence Toppman,100,"He's (Yimou) like a painter combining bloody reds, sunshine yellows and pale blues in the harmony of a masterpiece."
1369,from-dusk-till-dawn-movie,Desson Thomson,10,It's a triumph of vile over content; mindless nihilism posing as hipness.
1370,terminator-genisys-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,What could anyone have said of the finished film except that it was finished? Terminator Genisys plays like the worst of all outcomes.

1374,jesus-son-movie,Richard Corliss,80,It's best to see this as a drug buffet. Graze through the vignettes... and you'll find three or four tasty bits to snack on.
1375,big-fish-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"Like virtually all fish stories, it's discursive, funny, full of boasting, a suspect mix of truth and lies with an emphasis on the latter."
1376,ice-age-continental-drift-movie,Drew Taylor,75,"Handsomely animated and features a story that, while hopelessly familiar, at least seems to be part of a whole. Also, there are pirates. So there's that."

1378,the-seven-five-movie,Christopher Gray,25,It relays a story of police corruption that's transparently designed as a pitch for a feature-film adaptation.
1379,john-wick-chapter-2-movie,Bilge Ebiri,70,"This new film doesn’t have the emotional grounding of the original, and it probably dwells too long explaining things we never cared about. But it’s still a visceral, cathartic and — most important — gorgeous two hours of kinetic, poetic bloodshed."
1380,spider-man-homecoming-movie,Katie Walsh,75,"It's the non-superhero elements of Spider-Man: Homecoming that make it a great movie, and a non-stop fun summer flick. There isn't an ounce of fat on this film, packing in so many story elements and characters, while finding room for small, funny asides and moments that make it an addictively rich, idiosyncratic and re-watchable movie."
1381,far-out-isnt-far-enough-the-tomi-ungerer-story-movie,Betsy Sharkey,80,"As intriguing as the facts are, much of the documentary's charm is the way in which it embeds the work."
1382,don-verdean-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,20,Rockwell is charmless in a role that seems to be written that way.
1383,tron-legacy-movie,Peter Travers,75,"Bridges has a fine time playing with himself, so to speak. Add Garrett Hedlund as Flynn's son Sam, the rebel who zaps himself into the server to find his lost dad, and director Joseph Kosinski has a recipe for adventure that should delight gamers. Non-techies are on their own."
1384,hearts-in-atlantis-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,"Sometimes thrilling, sometimes suffocatingly tasteful adaptation of Stephen King's 1999 novel."
1385,the-social-network-movie,Roger Moore,100,"The performances, direction and writing of one of the best pictures of 2010 make this Social Network every bit as addictive, and a little chilling as well."
1386,confessions-of-a-shopaholic-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"Breathless and petite yet powerfully in-your-face, Fisher combines dizzy femininity and no-nonsense verve in the manner of a classic screwball heroine. She's like Carole Lombard reborn as a tiny angel-faced dynamo."
1387,gabriel-and-the-mountain-movie,Robert Abele,80,"A beautifully filmed, subtly political travelogue with some central conundrums."
1388,the-crossing-guard-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,10,"Penn's film is very slow, sententious, ill-judged about the tensions he wants in long scenes. [18 Dec 1995, Pg.28]"
1389,saint-laurent-movie,Joe McGovern,91,"Actor Ulliel, who’s been the face of both Chanel and Hannibal Lecter (in 2007’s Hannibal Rising), knows how to slither. His version of Yves is spoiled, insecure, cruel—and, in the movie’s ironic final shot, tickled to death that we still seem to care about him."
1390,behind-the-sun-movie,Steven Rea,88,"A compelling existential tableau: sweating bodies, creaking mills turned by numbed oxen, people facing the daily and seasonal cycles of life with little hope of breaking free. Behind the Sun is forceful stuff."
1391,life-partners-movie,Roger Moore,38,A slight and somewhat demure romantic comedy/friendship comedy built around two mildly interesting characters.
1392,bronson-movie,Walter Addiego,25,It's an assaultive work about an assaultive fellow.
1393,all-good-things-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"The result is a queasy combination of speculation and dramatic invention with the ring of half-truth, though the co-stars, Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst, add as much color as they can - not much - to a monochromatic script."
1394,moliere-movie,Liam Lacey,38,The result is as off-putting as biting into a confection in which the sugar has been replaced by salt.

1397,hulk-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,0,In future Lee can best serve his versatility by never doing anything like this again.
1398,edge-of-tomorrow-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"It's a star-driven mass-market entertainment that's smart, exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions."
1399,circumstance-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"The strongest message for most Western audiences will be the way the subjugation of women saturates every aspect of this society, and clearly informs even Mehran's kinkiness. Yes, but I wish Keshavarz had chosen a more low-key, everyday approach to two ordinary teenagers, and gone slowly on the lush eroticism and cinematic voyeurism."
1400,inescapable-movie,Sam Adams,67,"It’s a deeply confused movie, sometimes productively so."
1401,2016-obamas-america-movie,Roger Moore,38,"“Obama’s America” flutters to the ground like so much GOP convention confetti, all assertions, few facts and little substance other than the conspiratorial right wing talking points that are how D’Souza’s makes his living."

1405,the-rite-movie,Sean O\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Connell,12,"Hafstrom largely ignores the progress made by his demon-banishing predecessors and delivers a palatable PG-13 thriller that's safe, soft and sinfully cliched."
1406,eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"It is by turns comic, dark and surprisingly tender. If one must reduce it to simple description, call it a love story with a twist. Or a twisted love story."
1407,last-days-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,"There is a method to its madness, since the madness here is really Cobain's. Last Days mythologizes his suicide as a haunting act of fulfillment: the consummation of a life that had already ceased to be."
1408,the-sons-room-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,"The film portrays a family undone by grief over the death of a loved one; that, in any event, is its plot synopsis. More accurately, the film is a wallow of authorial narcissism, and a tedious, unrelenting, uninteresting wallow at that."
1409,the-winslow-boy-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Sixty seconds of wondering if someone is about to kiss you is more entertaining than 60 minutes of kissing. By understanding that, Mamet is able to deliver a G-rated film that is largely about adult sexuality."
1410,the-florida-project-movie,Alissa Wilkinson,100,"The Florida Project won’t let us look away. Nor, given its brilliance, would we want to. Instead, we laugh, we watch silently, and we’re challenged to stop simplifying people's lives so we can offer easy theoretical answers."
1411,unfaithful-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,"In the end, Unfaithful leaves you dispirited and grumpy: All that money spent, all that talent wasted, all that time gone forever, and for what? It's an ill movie that bloweth no man to good."
1412,the-first-wives-club-movie,Edward Guthmann,100,"It's a glamorous revenge romp, a ""9 to 5"" mixed with ""Auntie Mame,"" and it gives each star the opportunity to do her best work in a long, long time."
1413,the-wild-life-movie,Sara Stewart,25,"So dull, the kids in my audience didn’t laugh until 45 minutes in — And that was at a coconut head-bonk, a gag so timeless it almost doesn’t count."
1414,murder-on-the-orient-express-movie,Peter Travers,63,"Murder on the Orient Express offers audiences a deluxe journey to the past, but this pokey train goes off the rails about the time all the characters, except for Poirot, cease to matter.  "
1415,return-to-never-land-movie,Michael Dequina,10,More criminal than the lack of inspiration in Return to Never Land is the absence of a sense of magic.
1416,machine-gun-preacher-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"The failure lies not with the film's director, Marc Forster, nor with its impressive star, Gerard Butler, but with Jason Keller's dreadfully earnest script, which charts the hero's spiritual journey, and his Rambo-esque exploits, without offering a scintilla of mature perspective on his state of mind."
1417,film-stars-dont-die-in-liverpool-movie,Peter Travers,75,What an astounding actress Annette Bening is. And she’s at her very best in Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool playing Gloria Grahame.
1418,swept-away-movie,Jack Mathews,0,"A shrill, amateurish two-character play that demeans women and leaves men with the quaint notion that the best way to a woman's heart is through enslavement."
1419,lara-croft-tomb-raider-the-cradle-of-life-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,38,"Competent in the extreme, the talented Jolie would make a great Jane Bond. But mired in this joyless orgy of preposterousness, her biggest challenge is simply keeping a straight face."
1420,the-butterfly-effect-movie,Dave Kehr,10,"Inhabited by a genuine spirit of cruelty, both toward its characters and its audience. "
1421,bombshell-the-hedy-lamarr-story-movie,Steve Greene,83,"This film manages to celebrate the spirit that stood in opposition to limit her to what she looked like on a poster. It’s a reminder that, even for world-famous icons, it’s pointless to reduce people to a single piece of notoriety."
1422,me-before-you-movie,Kate Lloyd,80,"The movie manages to shift sensitively from laugh-out-loud moments to tear-jerking scenes, discussing euthanasia on the way. It’s not perfect, but the novel’s five million readers have nothing to worry about: it’s totally loyal to the book (unsurprisingly since Moyes wrote the script). "
1423,american-wedding-movie,Bruce Fretts,16,"The third helping of ''American Pie'' offers little more than crumbs. Half the franchise's core cast (including Mena Suvari, Chris Klein, and Tara Reid) chose to skip the big fat geek wedding."
1424,eastern-promises-movie,J. Hoberman,90,"A rhapsodic movie directed with considerable formal intelligence and brooding power from an original screenplay by Steve Knight, Eastern Promises is very much a companion to ""A History of Violence."""
1425,hansel-and-gretel-witch-hunters-movie,Tom Russo,75,"Wirkola tears through Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters with such giddy abandon, it ends up being splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun."
1426,barton-fink-movie,Rita Kempley,100,"What ""Raising Arizona"" was to baby lust, ""Barton Fink"" is to writer's block -- a rapturously funny, strangely bittersweet, moderately horrifying and, yes, truly apt description of the condition and its symptoms."
1427,mindhunters-movie,David Ng,10,"In an era of wall-to-wall ""CSI,"" Mindhunters' ghoulish forensic hubbub not only feels tiring but hopelessly redundant."
1428,ulees-gold-movie,Mike Clark,88,An emotionally honest low-ebber that builds to a satisfying wrap-up.
1429,the-limits-of-control-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"Jarmusch is making some kind of a point. I think the point is that if you strip a story down to its bare essentials, you will have very little left. I wonder how he pitched this idea to his investors."
1430,transformers-the-last-knight-movie,Rodrigo Perez,16,"The Last Knight is like a Red Bull-charged Bay yelling “I regret nothing!” as he jumps out of a plane backwards with no chute, detonating a megaton nuclear explosive while firing Uzis at his skydiving pals above him because hell, dude, that sounds like a wicked fond farewell. ["
1431,muscle-shoals-movie,Walter Addiego,75,"The hits just keep on coming in Muscle Shoals, a hugely entertaining, perhaps overlong, documentary about the renowned recording studios in the small Alabama town of the film's title. It's mandatory viewing for fans of the classic rock, soul and rhythm and blues of the 1960s and '70s. "
1432,rebound-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"The funny-looking kids steal every scene from Lawrence, simply by virtue of being funny-looking kids."
1433,the-water-diviner-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,0,"I have to assume that Russell Crowe and Warner Bros. did not deliberately set out to insult and anger the Armenian diaspora and its friends around the world, or to participate in covering up a monumental 20th-century crime that shaped the world we live in and remains swathed in too much historical shadow. They disgraced themselves by making this movie the way they did, and then redoubled the disgrace by releasing it this week. "
1434,mission-impossible-ii-movie,J. Hoberman,30,A vaguely absurd epidemiological thriller filled with elaborately superfluous setups and shamelessly stale James Bond riffs.
1435,showgirls-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,"The cynicism of the writer and director smacks of such self-hatred (fully acknowledged in the film's closing shot) that their disgust spills over onto all their characters (and their audience too), and inasmuch as everybody here is one kind of whore or another at virtually every moment, the fine moral distinctions this movie insists on making sometimes seem about as arcane and as loony as medieval theology about angels dancing on the heads of pins."
1436,before-night-falls-movie,Steven Rea,88,"This is a sad, passionate, beautifully wrought story, and Bardem's portrait of Arenas is at once daring and deeply moving."
1437,one-day-in-september-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,A gripping reminder of a brutal chapter of 20th-century history.
1438,star-trek-insurrection-movie,Stephen Holden,80,"Insurrection is breezily paced, and Michael Piller's screenplay has enough good-natured humor to keep things from bogging down into sentimental pomposity."
1439,control-2005-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,Antal has assembled what may be the single most colorless group of mangy lowlifes I have ever seen.
1440,3000-miles-to-graceland-movie,Tom Keogh,0,The film isn't merely bungled. It's starved and battered by Lichtenstein.
1441,chappie-movie,Todd McCarthy,30,"With unappealing one-note characters, retread concepts and implausible motivations, Chappie is a further downward step for director Neill Blomkamp."
1442,a-better-life-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,30,"Unlike its multifaceted director, the film never stretches its boundaries."
1443,uncovered-the-whole-truth-about-the-iraq-war-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,88,The result is a highly critical and impossible-to-dismiss examination of the administration's rush to war that is sure to move both sides of the political spectrum to apoplexy.
1444,the-forger-movie,Nikola Grozdanovic,25,"Uninspired films utilizing cinematic devices that felt old decades ago are a regrettable part of the cinematic viewing experience, and The Forger squarely falls into this category."
1445,the-cove-movie,Justin Chang,100,"Eco-activist documentaries don't get much more compelling than The Cove, an impassioned piece of advocacy filmmaking that follows ""Flipper"" trainer-turned-marine crusader Richard O'Barry in his efforts to end dolphin slaughter in Taiji, Japan."
1446,die-another-day-movie,Michael Dequina,80,"Brosnan's best mission as Bond yet, and the most satisfying installment of the franchise in recent memory."
1447,life-and-debt-movie,Keith Phipps,10,Tough to respect a documentary that doesn't play fair. Anyone interested in the subject would be better off spending Life And Debt's torturous 80-minute running time with a good article on the topic.
1448,the-wild-thornberrys-movie-movie,Loren King,88,"With braces on her teeth and preteen gawkiness, Eliza's a nerdy girl on the surface, but her backbone and chutzpah manage to save human and animal family alike. Move over Bond; this girl deserves a sequel."
1449,the-five-obstructions-movie,J. Hoberman,70,"An unclassifiable film-school exercise--one part documentary, one part psychodrama, and one part mock manifesto--The Five Obstructions mainly serves to illuminate the game-like nature of Lars von Trier's aesthetic project. "
1450,star-trek-beyond-movie,Bilge Ebiri,70,"Star Trek Beyond might be the Star Trekkiest film of the new, J.J. Abrams–ified Trek era. That is to say, it's the one that feels the most like a turbo-loaded episode of the original series, and has at least some of that classic spirit of exploration and derring-do. "
1451,map-of-the-human-heart-movie,Hal Hinson,100,"A marvelous breakthrough, a film of incantatory intensity and moment by a prodigiously gifted young filmmaker."
1452,stigmata-movie,Andy Seiler,38,The scariest thing about this appalling and seemingly endless movie is that you paid for your ticket and now have to sit through it.
1453,8mm-movie,Dennis Lim,0,"A nasty piece of work, and it's nasty in a particularly ostentatious and sophomoric way."
1454,the-hottie-the-nottie-movie,Nathan Lee,0,"Crass, shrill, disingenuous, tawdry, mean-spirited, vulgar, idiotic, boring, slapdash, half-assed, and very, very unfunny."
1455,dinosaur-movie,Desmond Ryan,75,"An undeniable and, indeed, unprecedented technical feat that's a feast for the eye, Dinosaur is less easy on the ear."
1456,john-wick-movie,John Semley,12,"John Wick is the most blatant attempt to establish a character’s name recognition since the Angelina Jolie actioneer ""Salt."""
1457,match-point-movie,Peter Travers,88,Woody Allen's best movie in years means to trip us up: Sexual sizzle. London instead of Manhattan. Brit actors. Dark humor with a sting that leaves welts. You bet it's a change. And it looks good on the Woodman.
1458,borgman-movie,Stephen Holden,90,"That Borgman restrains itself from turning into a full-scale horror movie makes it all the more unsettling, although it has its bumpy moments."
1459,citizenfour-movie,Eric Kohn,91,"Poitras, an expert filmmaker as keyed into pace and mood as the topic they support, delivers a mesmerizing look at both how Snowden managed to release his information as well as why it all matters."
1460,sarahs-key-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,75,"A movingly told tale of tragedy and its consequences, not just for the players in the original tragedy but also for those touched by their actions, in an ever-widening circle of aftershocks. "
1461,twelve-monkeys-movie,Peter Travers,100,"Gilliam, along with the gifted cinematographer Roger Pratt and production designer Jeffrey Beecroft, fashions a disturbing and dazzling lost world."
1462,guncrazy-movie,Joe Pollack,38,"Tamra Davis, directing her first feature, is so caught up in the sex-and-violence aspects, and bolstering the body count, that she forgets to keep her story at all credible, and lets gunshots take the place of conversation. [19 Feb 1993, p.3G]"
1463,the-adventures-of-pluto-nash-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines.
1464,revanche-movie,Steven Rea,88,"A slow-burning, character-rich study in desperation, grief, vengeance, loyalty, and love. It's the sort of arthouse entry - in German, mostly - that gets you thinking about an English-language remake."
1465,nanny-mcphee-movie,Staff (Not credited),70,"Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine) directs with skill, Thompson's screenplay (this is a labor of love) is witty, and the classy cast includes Colin Firth (as the kids' baffled widower-father), Angela Lansbury, Imelda Staunton, and Celia Imrie. Good fun."
1466,absolute-power-movie,Richard Corliss,70,"The warming, nicely played relationship of the burglar and his lawyer daughter (Laura Linney) is the source of the film's absolute power. [24 Feb 1997, p. 67]"
1467,promised-land-movie,Joe Williams,63,"Because he's the protagonist of the movie and played by the likable Matt Damon, we keep an open mind, but Promised Land is morally ambiguous to a fault."
1468,super-troopers-2-movie,Owen Gleiberman,30,Super Troopers 2 is an aggressively lame and slobby comedy full of cardboard characters and in-your-face naughty jokes that feel about as dangerous as old vaudeville routines.
1469,the-fast-and-the-furious-movie,William Arnold,67,"With its machine-gun editing, extremely loud (mostly rap) soundtrack, occasional music-video interlude and overall in-your-face sensibility, it's a movie that's determined to chase anyone past age 30 or so right out of theater."
1470,monkey-shines-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,80,"Despite a hokey prologue and ending (the latter imposed by producer Charles Evans), this is one of George Romero's most effective and interesting horror thrillers—not as profound as his remarkable Living Dead trilogy, but unusually gripping and provocative. "
1471,gomorrah-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"Given the breadth of the story, the characters never achieve much depth, but they're part of a larger pattern: the younger ones are eager to find their way into the organization while the older ones are desperate to find their way out"
1472,deja-vu-movie,David Ansen,70,"It's preposterous, but never dull: Scott whips the action into a taut, tasty lather."
1473,angel-a-movie,Wesley Morris,38,The movie might have been more tolerable had Besson searched harder for a performer and not a specimen. Barbara Stanwyck in her prime might have made more sense.
1474,ill-see-you-in-my-dreams-movie,Keith Uhlich,67,"Every actor gives their all, even when the material is insultingly thin. "
1475,grown-ups-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"When Grown Ups star and co-writer Adam Sandler repeatedly slapped Rob Schneider in the face with a dehydrated banana, I was jealous of Schneider, who suffered less than I did getting slapped upside the head by this rotting fruit of a comedy."
1476,in-the-company-of-men-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,90,"An unusually fine screenplay, then, yet LaBute's accomplishment goes further. He has envisioned a cinematic style for his film that harmonizes exactly with its theme and mood.  [Sept 1, 1997]"
1477,domestic-disturbance-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,38,"Sttrictly movie-of-the-week stuff. And not very good stuff, at that."
1478,sanctum-movie,Steven Rea,63,"Grisly stuff. The movie, shot in Australia with an Aussie and British cast, makes ""127 Hours"" look like a walk in the park."
1479,scary-movie-movie,Marc Savlov,0,I'd rather have a testicular nail-gun mishap than sit through this migraine-inducing train wreck of a film one more time.
1480,synecdoche-new-york-movie,Scott Foundas,70,"Like most of Kaufman's work as a writer, Synecdoche, New York is a head trip that time and again returns to a place of real human emotion--in this case, to the idea that no matter how brilliant we may be or think we are, we're all looking for a little guidance (or, yes, direction) in life."
1481,the-last-mountain-movie,Steven Rea,88,"The Last Mountain, more than anything, asks us to consider where our energy comes from, and how we can bring about changes that benefit all of us and the planet we live on."
1482,nola-circus-movie,Joe Leydon,0,NOLA Circus (the title refers to both a lead character and the abbreviation for New Orleans) is the kind of hideously unfunny folderol in which most cast members are encouraged to act at the top of their lungs to compensate for  the witless script.
1483,drowning-mona-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,I didn't laugh once.
1484,the-good-guy-movie,Betsy Sharkey,70,"The result is a more-clever-than-most window into modern urban yuppie mating rituals, tracking just how tough it is to keep a grip on love and the corporate ladder at the same time."
1485,last-resort-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"This is the best class of poetic realism, the kind you can believe in without a trace of hesitation."
1486,the-guru-movie,Eric Celeste,30,There are enough good scenes within the 94 minutes of The Guru to make an entertaining coming-attractions trailer. 
1487,fathers-day-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,"Maybe Hollywood has used this ""uptight guy liberated by free spirit"" idea too many times. Either way, this is a form of recycling that no longer pays off. [9 May 1997, p.1E]"
1488,love-ranch-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,"Taylor Hackford, fails to squeeze the tiniest bit of juice, sexy or comic or otherwise, out of the chintzy-libertine locale."
1489,fred-claus-movie,Michael Sragow,33,Is there anything more pathetic than a movie that will do anything for a laugh or a tear that doesn't get any laughs or tears?
1490,the-sum-of-all-fears-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Director Phil Alden Robinson and his writers, Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne, do a spellbinding job of cranking up the tension, they create a portrait of convincing realism, and then they add the other stuff because, well, if anybody ever makes a movie like this without the obligatory Hollywood softeners, audiences might flee the theater in despair."
1491,lockout-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Besson co-wrote and produced this cheesy mash-up of elements from James Bond and ""Battlestar Galactica."""
1492,death-wish-movie,Barry Hertz,12,The only thing stopping Roth's film from being an irredeemable zero-star disaster is its introduction of a dramatic principle that I'm nicknaming Chekhov's Gun Cabinet – but that's hardly justice for such a recklessly criminal cinematic act as Death Wish.
1493,into-the-storm-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,38,"Hollywood's latest entry in that tried-and-true genre, the disaster movie, is . . . well, it's like . . . a totally gnarly roller-coaster ride!"
1494,a-guy-thing-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"The stars have little opportunity to engage their characters. The gang-written screenplay and Chris Koch's artless direction turn their scenes into a series of broad, overplayed comic sketches."
1495,keeping-the-faith-movie,Diana Abu-Jaber,0,Chock-full of the sort of levity that leaves you feeling you've been beaten about the head with a lead pipe.
1496,the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-movie,Alison Willmore,91,"The film is also an earnest, big-hearted ode to friends as support and salvation, and to the talismanic quality a favorite song, treasured hang-out, or shared tradition can take on for a teenager."
1497,the-kids-are-all-right-movie,Roger Moore,88,"That humor is a the delicious underpinning to whatever melodrama happens as these five connect and clash. And that humor is what reassures us, even at its darkest moments, that no matter how things work out for the adults, these kids are going to be all right."
1498,the-whole-nine-yards-movie,Shawn Levy,16,"A witless, listless muck-up that sends you reeling from the theater with thoughts of suicide instead of a chipper grin."
1499,before-sunset-movie,Karen Karbo,100,"Hawke is not a brilliant actor, but here he rises to the occasion: Every inch of him registers the weight of this moment."
1500,the-adventures-of-rocky-bullwinkle-movie,Marc Caro,75,"Stuffed with smart Internet gags, silly movie references and a happy energy that makes you forgive the sequences that don't work."
1501,mojave-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,30,"Is Mojave's twisty purposelessness showing how producers ruin the work of screenwriters, or is it evidence that screenwriters often need another set of eyes?"
1502,the-darkest-minds-movie,Dana Schwartz,33,"There is no resolution for any of the story lines haphazardly dangling like electrical wires. No villain is defeated, no secrets are explained. When the credits roll, there has been no catharsis for the 90 minutes of movie preceding it, which makes it all feel like a protracted introductory sequence for a sequel that, god willing, will never come."
1503,the-journey-movie,Roger Moore,63,"The Journey‘s wonderful stars — Spall, Meaney, Highmore, a testy Stephens and of course Hurt — make this sentimental saunter go down easily."
1504,the-party-movie,Kate Taylor,100,"With its claustrophobic unity of time and place, the disintegrating party feels highly theatrical and, of various classic screen adaptations from the stage, this wonderfully performed black-and-white film recalls in particular Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf."" Yet also, Potter's comic dissection of the London intelligentsia's personal and political angst is completely of the moment."
1505,standard-operating-procedure-movie,Glenn Kenny,88,"It's distinctly Morrisean, as it were, and seeing his style applied to subject matter with which one is already somewhat familiar makes one... well, question the style a bit."
1506,kill-list-movie,Betsy Sharkey,80,"This is a far more brutal film than Wheatley's first, 2009's ""Down Terrace."" Though it had crime at its center as well, it was balanced by a dry irony and far less blood. There is no offset in Kill List, with one scene so relentless in its gore that it makes the notorious elevator scene in ""Drive"" pale in comparison."
1507,legend-of-the-guardians-the-owls-of-gahoole-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,"An unmemorable, frenzied, characterless hodgepodge that delights the eyes while numbing the brain."
1508,shoot-em-up-movie,A.O. Scott,0,A worthless piece of garbage.
1509,duma-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"This is precisely the kind of film that parents clamor for and rarely get: a substantive, stirring, Huck Finn-style saga that doesn't insult anyone's intelligence or mindlessly entertain with crass humor."
1510,deliver-us-from-evil-2014-movie,Kyle Anderson,33,This rote exorcism-is-real claptrap.
1511,elling-movie,Steven Rea,88,A sweet but unsticky comedy from Norway that was one of the five foreign- language nominees at this year's Academy Awards.

1513,the-wolverine-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"It's simply a more focused scenario than usual, full of violence done up with a little more coherence and visceral impact than usual. "
1514,knowing-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,30,"Director Alex Proyas resolutely thinks in B-movie terms. Even with an A-list budget, he oversells every plot point and gooses the thrills with hokey lighting, bombastic music and serious overacting."
1515,faceoff-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,90,"Woo's third Hollywood movie, Face/Off, is the first to balance his visual imagination with the emotional intensity of his Hong Kong films."
1516,ratatouille-movie,Tasha Robinson,91,"Bird and his co-writers leave room for quiet moments and gentle morals, but for the most part, they send visual gags and verbal punchlines tearing past at an enjoyably demanding speed, whipping up the film's energy at every turn."
1517,the-huntsman-winters-war-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"Its badness is not extreme, but exemplary: It’s everything wrong with Hollywood today stuffed into a little less than two hours."
1518,the-grey-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,80,"What is surprising is how poetic the movie is, partly thanks to its high-lonesome sound design and the desolate beauty of its visuals, but mostly because of its star, Liam Neeson. "
1519,joy-movie,Kate Taylor,12,"If his direction is erratic, the script he wrote with Annie Mumolo (Bridesmaids) has gaps you could drive a truck through and dialogue filled with painfully obvious exposition of plot, motive and theme."
1520,the-trip-to-spain-movie,Kimberley Jones,78,"In a startling, last-reel freeze frame, the male ego pops like a balloon, and I wanted to pre-book for the next Trip right away."
1521,living-in-oblivion-movie,Mick LaSalle,88,"Living in Oblivion is a rarity, a dark comedy that takes place almost entirely on a film set. Written and directed by Tom DiCillo, this is a very funny picture that presents the world of independent film making as a nightmare of conflicting egos, budgetary squalor and incompetence."
1522,vera-drake-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Expansive, but succinct. Leigh tells a small story and doesn't try to make something huge of it."
1523,a-war-movie,Anthony Lane,70,"The movie is memorable and draining, but “Full Metal Jacket” it is not."
1524,i-spit-on-your-grave-movie,Roger Ebert,0,"This despicable remake of the despicable 1978 film ""I Spit on Your Grave"" adds yet another offense: a phony moral equivalency. "
1525,the-four-times-le-quattro-volte-movie,Keith Phipps,83,"It's a remote location, but Frammartino's canny eye, wry humor, and careful sense of rhythm make it feel like the best possible spot to observe the workings of the world, from ashes to ashes. "
1526,ever-after-movie,Lisa Alspector,70,"Their blossoming love is thwarted at every opportunity by wicked stepmother Anjelica Huston, whose practical motive -- she wants her own daughter to become queen -- is part of an unusually nuanced characterization."
1527,bugsy-movie,Mick LaSalle,63,"It's long; it's expensive, and it was clearly created with the intention of being a great film. I've got nothing against bloated epics, just as I have nothing against blockbusters. But as bloated epics go, Bugsy is not particularly special. [20 Dec 1991, p.C1]"
1528,lonely-hearts-movie,David Denby,70,"The story of Fernandez and Beck may be grotesque comedy, but Todd Robinson tells it straight, without flinching from its piteousness, horror, or banality."
1529,incendies-movie,Bob Mondello,100,The storytelling in Incendies strikes me as primal the way Greek tragedy is primal. Shattering. Cathartic. It is a breathtaking film. 
1530,trolls-movie,Vadim Rizov,30,"Trolls is a pretty standard piece of subpar DreamWorks product: loud and shiny, more than a tad frantic despite a generic set of characters."
1531,the-gatekeepers-movie,Ty Burr,100,"It’s about spycraft, but it goes to the source. If for no other reason, it deserves to be seen for arranging decades of events in the Middle East into a chronology that, to an outsider, makes dreadful sense."
1532,passionada-movie,Kim Morgan,33,"There are movies that are made for the big screen, and movies that are made for the small screen; Passionada is the latter type. "
1533,blackkklansman-movie,Robbie Collin,80,"A heady hybrid of comedy, polemic and period crime drama, it could have been scattergun stuff, and there are patches of preachy overkill. Much more often, though, there’s a rollicking drive and focus to it."
1534,escobar-paradise-lost-movie,Chuck Bowen,38,"Benicio Del Toro's performance is showy, a great actor's parade of indulgences that occasionally sets the deranged camp tone that should have been the narrative's starting point."
1535,serendipity-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"Serendipity is ""Sliding Doors"" with no alternate versions; it's willed enchantment all the way."
1536,baby-geniuses-movie,Lael Loewenstein,10,"A thoroughly misguided, unfunny film that proves you shouldn't beat a dead horse."
1537,blindspotting-movie,Gregory Ellwood,83,"Yes, you’ll likely leave the theater blown away by Casal and Diggs’ considerable talent, but its Estrada’s vision that will haunt you."
1538,a-guy-thing-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"For about 10 minutes, it works."
1539,son-of-the-mask-movie,Allison Benedikt,38,"Even with a new leading man and a more family-friendly rating, some things never change: The Mask still stars Industrial Light & Magic."
1540,vanishing-on-7th-street-movie,Amy Biancolli,0,"This is a terrible movie. It has no business being as terrible as it is, because it boasts a perfectly acceptable horror premise and a perfectly acceptable cast."

1543,tommy-boy-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"The movie is an assembly of clichés and obligatory scenes from dozens of other movies, all are better. It has only one original idea, and that's a bad one: The inspiration of making the hero's sidekick into, simultaneously, his buddy, his critic and his rival."
1544,hard-ball-movie,Peter Travers,10,The film takes a true story and drags it through a swamp of hyped-up Hollywood cliches.
1545,polisse-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"I wish the entirety of Polisse were as good as its parts, but perhaps its free-form, mood-swing approach was unavoidable, given the subject. The audience is put through the same wringer as the cops."
1546,bowfinger-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"Offers a lot of laughs, a heartwarming core."
1547,beverly-hills-cop-iii-movie,Peter Rainer,10,"There's a fundamental lack of human feeling in Beverly Hills Cop III that makes you want to avert your eyes from the people around you when the lights come up. Attending this movie makes you feel like an accomplice to the corruption. [25 May 1994, p.1]"
1548,marauders-movie,Brian Tallerico,12,"Even for how negatively I responded to the bafflingly inept Marauders, I choose to believe that Miller and his overly talented cast didn’t just do it for a paycheck. Even with that in mind, it’s hard to forgive."
1549,welcome-to-mooseport-movie,Shawn Levy,0,"It's a terrible movie, ugly to look at, tediously drawn out, unfunny in every cell and fiber of its being. "
1550,chocolate-city-movie,Roger Moore,38,"The costumes — cop, soldier, Spartan and cowboy — and lack of them mimics “Magic Mike.” The melodrama — keeping his sideline secret from his mother and would-be girlfriend — duller."
1551,sacrifice-1969-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"In Sacrifice, about a father who loses his son to the power of the state, it is difficult to miss the parallels with Chen's own life. "
1552,the-luzhin-defence-movie,Desmond Ryan,63,Falls short of being totally absorbing and compelling.
1553,assault-on-precinct-13-movie,David Edelstein,30,Lousy remake.
1554,money-monster-movie,Melissa Anderson,30,"As generic and impersonal as a new credit card offer, Jodie Foster’s Money Monster is the latest big-studio production to try to cash in on populist outrage over Wall Street abuses and New Gilded Age inequality."
1555,sweet-november-movie,Jami Bernard,25,"A hellacious stew of romance and tragedy that gives the words ""screwball"" and ""pathos"" a bad name."
1556,focus-movie,Michael Wilmington,63,It's a good film but an over-obvious one. I wish I'd liked it more.
1557,letters-to-juliet-movie,Ty Burr,38,The larger problem is that the central duo is just plain dull.
1558,meeks-cutoff-movie,Eric Kohn,100,Reichardt crafts a highly textured narrative that both invokes the mythology of the American frontier and cleverly transcends it.
1559,hillarys-america-the-secret-history-of-the-democratic-party-movie,Tom Keogh,12,"D’Souza manipulates viewers’ passions while telling them who to blame for their bile. As for Hillary, D’Souza asserts she wants to nationalize all our industries and steal all our money. His lack of evidence undercuts his message."
1560,10000-bc-movie,Marc Savlov,0,The only evolution in question here is that of Emmerich's skills as a director of motion pictures.
1561,youth-in-oregon-movie,Nick Schager,30,"Maudlin and mannered, this contrived indie squanders another fine late-career performance from Frank Langella, dousing its treatment of the subject in affectations until it’s snuffed out any trace of genuine life."
1562,the-lady-movie,Ella Taylor,65,"The accomplished actress Michelle Yeoh, who brought the project to Besson, is a regal beauty who brings off an uncanny resemblance to Suu Kyi largely through posture and the trademark flowers the activist wore in her hair."
1563,imaginary-heroes-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,Never manages to achieve the balance between authenticity and eccentricity.
1564,little-fockers-movie,Steve Persall,0,"A comedy abomination, tasteless and useless to a stunning degree, with storied actors smugly collecting paychecks for sullying their careers. "
1565,hot-pursuit-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"So there’s nothing here to see, except maybe the white dress that Vergara wears in her first scene. "
1566,black-girl-1966-movie,Richard Brody,70,"Ousmane Sembène, in his first feature film, from 1966—which is also widely considered the first feature made by an African—distills a vast range of historical crises and frustrated ambitions into an intimate, straightforwardly realistic drama."
1567,suburbia-movie,Scott Rosenberg,70,"Linklater gets great performances from his young cast, and you'll find yourself thinking about the characters and their travails well after the movie's finish."
1568,rescue-dawn-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"There's never any question how Rescue Dawn will end, but as conventional and straightforward as the movie is, it's easy to understand why Herzog was driven to tell this story twice."
1569,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"If you're going to direct a piece of crass, nonsensical junk, at least have the decency to release it straight to video, where it belongs."

1571,eraser-movie,David Ansen,70,"Director Charles (""The Mask"") Russell is no James Cameron. He can produce a requisite amount of suspense and mayhem..., but his filmmaking is strictly B-movie generic. [01 Jul 1996 Pg.62]"
1572,the-leopard-re-release-movie,Scott Tobias,100,"Virtually every Super Technirama frame of Luchino Visconti's 1963 masterpiece The Leopard could be described as ""painterly"" in its ornate details and exquisitely balanced color compositions. (Review of DVD Release)"
1573,couples-retreat-movie,Peter Rainer,0,It's the audience for this film that will require therapy.
1574,a-quiet-place-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,80,"There is not a lot more to the story other than the effort to stay quiet and, thus, stay alive. But the pregnancy, along with a couple of other squirm-inducing set pieces, is enough to keep you on edge."
1575,true-grit-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,85,"Mattie is a no-nonsense mite with a forthright manner and a mean head for figures; she wears her hair in two sturdy braids whose tips have never seen the inside of any inkwell, believe you me."
1576,my-journey-through-french-cinema-movie,Godfrey Cheshire,75,"The movie, then, is not just a niche film but a film for a niche of a niche. Rather than being ideal for people who know a bit about French cinema and want to know more, it’s best suited to people who know a considerable amount about French cinema (and culture) of the early sound era and want to delve deeper."
1577,kids-in-the-hall-brain-candy-movie,Carrie Rickey,63,"A cheesily entertaining effort that recalls the irreverent '50s comedies of Jerry Lewis. [12 Apr 1996, p.03]"
1578,sounder-movie,Staff (Not Credited),75,Sounder is one of the truest examples of a family film ever made and a triumph for all concerned.
1579,the-theory-of-everything-movie,Lou Lumenick,100,"Visually imaginative, The Theory of Everything is an unusually compelling true-life story about an extraordinary couple triumphing over adversity. It’s my favorite movie so far this year."
1580,dracula-untold-movie,Stephen Whitty,25,"If this Dracula can kill hundreds of enemies by himself — and he can, and does, in several dull and protracted battle scenes — then where's the suspense? If he's become a monster for noble reasons, then where's the dark conflict?"
1581,rebound-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Starts off bad, then tapers off."
1582,true-grit-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"The best way to approach Joel and Ethan Coen's eagerly awaited True Grit is to lower your expectations, then lower them a bit more. The problem is not the movie, which is a terrific, no-nonsense, straightforward western. The surprise – or vague disappointment – is the prevailing lack of Coen-ness in the movie."
1583,snowpiercer-movie,Kimberley Jones,89,"Snowpiercer holds its own; it’s an unruly but rattling – and ravishing – work of art. On first watch, I wondered if there was anything to scratch beneath the surface – it seemed so straightforward, I worried there wasn’t enough there there – so I rewatched it almost right away and was surprised to find it still left me panting. "
1584,mission-to-mars-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"Startlingly inept from start to finish -- it's atrociously written, poorly shot and edited and fatally unfocused."
1585,the-notorious-bettie-page-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"Gretchen Mol is unrelentingly charming in the role and she almost - almost - makes you believe that someone as unclouded as this could actually exist. This film would go well on a double bill with ""The Stepford Wives."""
1586,t2-trainspotting-movie,Richard Roeper,100,"T2 Trainspotting has one foot firmly planted in nostalgia and the other rooted in the present, and thanks in great part to Boyle’s unique, world-class talent, everything old feels new again, and everything new has the blazing look of an original and blazing piece of art."
1587,life-during-wartime-movie,Rex Reed,0,"What some critics praise as astute and compelling, I find juvenile and fraught with hysteria. There's no arc here, no real pathos, and the direction is like watching snow melt on the side of a road."
1588,unsane-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"Meant to evoke such distinctive examples of the genre as “Shock Corridor,” “The Snake Pit” and, on a much grander scale, “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” And it’s also safe to say that whether or not you enjoy Unsane — I didn’t, for the most part — there’s a terrific scene in a padded cell."
1589,gloria-movie,Scott Tobias,10,An inexplicable and disastrous mismatch of sensibilities.
1590,domino-movie,Keith Phipps,30,"Domino de-emphasizes the human element--not to mention such niceties as plot and clarity--to such a degree that only those who show up purely to watch combustibles go ""boom"" won't feel insulted."
1591,the-tillman-story-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"He just wasn't the sort of hero the government pretended he was. This eye-opening, inspiring movie is a permanent corrective to that deception."

1596,the-amati-girls-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"The movie should be praying to St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes. Maybe he could perform a miracle and turn this into a cable offering, so no one has to buy a ticket to see it."
1597,oscar-and-lucinda-movie,Richard Schickel,90,"Its business is to turn sure-thing expectations into a game of chance, and provide us with that rarity--a genuinely eccentric yet deeply insinuating film."
1598,one-thousand-ae-movie,Laremy Legel,12,"After Earth stupefies us with nonsense, such little thought and logic went into this idea that it can’t even be considered a rough draft, this is a movie almost daring an audience to emotionally detach throughout. For shame!"
1599,stop-loss-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,Stop-Loss is a film that does it right.
1600,the-last-face-movie,Claudia Puig,15,This is about as egregious as filmmaking gets.
1601,old-dogs-movie,Stephen Holden,0,"This imbecilic, mean-spirited farce, which sneers at adults, leaves you wondering: where are the Three Stooges when we really need them?"
1602,love-1969-movie,Jamie Graham,100,"A compassionate, masterful work that deservedly won Haneke a second Palme d'Or after ""The White Ribbon's"" 2009 victory. Best to avoid on a first date, though."
1603,all-the-pretty-horses-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"Thornton and his excellent company summon up for us the long rides, dangerous companions, rites of passage, the mad love and, most of all, the special relationship between the man/boys that rode over the border and the horses that carried them there."
1604,norman-the-moderate-rise-and-tragic-fall-of-a-new-york-fixer-movie,Kenji Fujishima,75,Writer-director Joseph Cedar charts Norman's rise-and-fall arc with the attention to detail of a procedural. 
1605,arachnophobia-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Arachnophobia is a skin-crawling horror film that never loses its cheeky, throwaway edge. "
1606,the-avengers-movie,Charles Taylor,10,"The film flails incoherently from set to set, trying to be kicky and madcap and pop, but with no sense of the show's casual acceptance of the absurd."
1607,three-extremes-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"What all three of these stories share is the quality found in Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King: An attention to horror as it emerges from everyday life as transformed by fear, fantasy and depravity."
1608,the-human-centipede-ii-full-sequence-movie,Karina Longworth,0,"It's perhaps the sequel we deserve. But that doesn't mean this dumb, blunt follow-up - both more unspeakably grotesque and less scary than the first film - is worth sitting through. Once Six's conceptual project becomes clear, his escalating audience-mocking torture is increasingly pointless. "
1609,the-to-do-list-movie,Bilge Ebiri,70,"The To Do List feels fresh and strange and wondrously new. It shouldn’t, but it does."
1610,rampage-movie,Kate Taylor,25,"The plot is cursory, the dialogue is repetitive and the psychology is cheap. Hanging in for the wanton violence may prove too much for anyone not seriously addicted to the guilty pleasures of cheesy sci-fi."
1611,mumford-movie,Jack Mathews,100,Among the funniest and most satisfying films I've seen in years.
1612,paper-heart-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"A quasi-documentary about love that is sweet, true and perhaps a little deceptive."
1613,pan-movie,Peter Travers,25,"Joe Wright's origin story of Peter and the lost boys has to be the dimmest, deadliest take ever on J.M. Barrie's Pan myth."
1614,borgmcenroe-movie,Ann Hornaday,88,"Sometimes a movie comes along that, devoid of a noisy publicity push or festival buzz, quietly ambushes the unsuspecting viewer with an absorbing, skillfully executed, meaningful and thoroughly entertaining experience. Ladies and gentlemen, Borg vs. McEnroe is just that kind of film. "
1615,the-twilight-saga-new-moon-movie,Ella Taylor,30,"Chaste, oddly bloodless, and nearly plotless saga."
1616,this-is-spinal-tap-re-release-movie,David Ansen,100,"Reiner has made a very hip, sophisticated sendup, but his affection and feel for life on the road keep the satire friendly. This is surely the funniest movie ever made about rock and roll, and one of the funniest things about it is that it may also be one of the most accurate. [5 March 1984, p.81]"
1617,mr-deeds-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"There's no chemistry between Deeds and Babe, but then how could there be, considering that their characters have no existence, except as the puppets in scenes of plot manipulation."
1618,the-negotiator-movie,Emanuel Levy,70,"The teaming of Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey, two of the most highly regarded actors around, in perfectly fitting roles that call for a battle of wits and wills, proves to be a shrewd piece of casting, and the best element of The Negotiator."
1619,flatliners-2017-movie,David Edelstein,10,"I wish I could tell you they made a mistake and it’s not so bad, but, as Andy Kaufman’s Foreign Man would put it, “Ees so bad, ees terrible.”"
1620,hoodlum-movie,Keith Phipps,10,"A conclusion featuring a dizzying string of betrayals that leads to a confusing anti-climax robs the film of even cheap action thrills, making Hoodlum an almost thoroughly forgettable experience, albeit probably the only film in history to unite Queen Latifah and The Mod Squad's Clarence Williams III."
1621,ripd-movie,Laremy Legel,36,"There is a legitimate film in here somewhere, buried deep beneath the rubble of its terrible script and editing."
1622,horrible-bosses-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,30,The lameness of the gags and dialogue and the film's frequent deep dives for the bottom at the expense of real comedy speak to desperation in Hollywood to figure out the audience for contemporary naughty comedy.
1623,legends-of-the-fall-movie,Desson Howe,10,It doesn't take long to realize that Legends is an unintentional howler.
1624,hoffa-movie,Stephen Hunter,25,The movie is a corpse. It's a fish that stinks from the head. They ought to bury it in the Jersey Meadowlands. [25 Dec 1992]
1625,dirty-grandpa-movie,Richard Roeper,0,"If Dirty Grandpa isn’t the worst movie of 2016, I have some serious cinematic torture in my near future."
1626,new-best-friend-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"Clearly the product of an editing-room scramble, New Best Friend is a self-lambasting farce, despite Kirshner's passionate college try at establishing a third dimension in a brain-dead movie flatland."
1627,mesrine-public-enemy-no-1-movie,Michelle Orange,65,The main and most enjoyable difference between the second installment and the first is the greater opportunity the latter provides Cassel to sketch some dimension into the coded mythologizing of his character.
1628,dark-river-movie,Fionnuala Halligan,90,"Dark River is distinguished by superior film-making and admirable command of tone and pacing. Once again, Barnard delivers an intimate take on a difficult subject, raising anticipation for her future work should she decide to scale up."
1629,just-go-with-it-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,25,"A bummer - slack rather than loose, tired rather than fun."
1630,columbus-movie,Andrew Crump,89,"The places and things Kogonada includes in his frame are important for drawing us into Columbus’s world, but it’s Richardson who gives that world its shape, supplying her director’s clean, static compositions, captured in long shots, with aching humanity molded by doubt and disappointment."
1631,the-lie-movie,Nick Pinkerton,30,"Weixler is an alert, mobile comedienne who deserves better than this awkward pause, nervous stammer, social-anxiety comedy. "
1632,a-thousand-years-of-good-prayers-movie,Nathan Lee,70,"A gentle, pleasantly unrushed piece of moviemaking. There’s a tonic simplicity to how it gets the job done, and if the film comes off as fairly conventional stuff, it nevertheless succeeds on its own modest, middlebrow terms."
1633,lake-placid-movie,Scott Tobias,30,At least White summons the camp energy that Lake Placid is fecklessly seeking.
1634,burlesque-movie,Carrie Rickey,63,Burlesque is a preposterous and intermittently entertaining lesson in how to make a movie musical with a little brains and a lot of talent. 
1635,graduation-movie,A.O. Scott,90,"Graduation is long and intense, a rigorously naturalistic film that at times feels as claustrophobic and suspenseful as a horror movie. Like Mr. Mungiu’s other work, it is a thriller of sorts, built around an excruciating ethical problem. He is unstinting in his sympathy and unsparing in his judgment."
1636,blended-movie,Kate Erbland,34,Sound nonsensical? It is.
1637,one-for-the-money-movie,Mike Scott,25,"I guess I can't call the movie sexist as it was largely produced, directed and written by women. So I'll settle for calling it dull, corny and amateurish instead."
1638,the-other-dream-team-movie,Scott Tobias,75,"Markevicius tells this incredible yarn through the significantly less exciting format of an ESPN-style documentary, which gets the job done with minimal flourish. Still, he employs former Lithuanian greats like Arvydas Sabonis and Sarunas Marciulionis to serve as guides to the country's past and present, and the basketball culture that's thrived there under the best and worst of times."
1639,the-omen-movie,Wesley Morris,25,It's a terrible sign for a movie when the sole reason for its existence is a satanic opening date.
1640,we-dont-live-here-anymore-movie,Duane Byrge,80,Director John Curran has masterfully managed to convey flesh and blood within the permutations of the sometimes clinical story. Enhancing the people-next-door nature of this saga were the film's smart technical contributions.
1641,in-the-blood-movie,Brian Tallerico,25,"When you reach the critical point that you consider that Trejo, the star of such gems as “Zombie Hunter” and “Dead in Tombstone”, to be above this material, you know you’re in a rare category of awful. "
1642,mr-3000-movie,Sara Gebhardt,30,The script is much like a nine-inning sitcom that uses an obvious formula to tell a familiar story while garnering cheap laughs.
1643,phantom-of-the-paradise-movie,Philip French,70,A garish cult thriller.
1644,reprise-movie,Marc Mohan,75,"Youth may be wasted on some of the young, but the two aspiring Norwegian novelists at the center of Reprise, director Joachim Trier's debut feature, try desperately to avoid that particular cliche."
1645,man-on-the-train-movie,Wesley Morris,63,"There's the air of sadness and worry all over this movie, and sometimes it's heavy. But it's air all the same. "
1646,the-human-race-movie,Chris Klimek,10,"On your mark, get set, go find something else to watch! Because The Human Race, a dreary, smeary, low-low-budget but even lower-inspiration horror flick from British writer-director Paul Hough, is likely to leave viewers rueing the craven, disappointing species into which they were, through no fault of their own, born."
1647,the-devils-rejects-movie,Robert K. Elder,0,Evil isn't this boring.
1648,american-splendor-movie,Sean Axmaker,91,"In the world of comic-book movies, American Splendor is the real deal, the warts-and-all adventures of the most unlikely hero on the comic stands."
1649,thunderbirds-movie,Nathan Rabin,30,"Dreary, joyless. "
1650,while-were-young-movie,Joe Williams,88,Only an artist at the midpoint between the maypole and maturity could concoct a comedy as potent as While We’re Young.
1651,i-daniel-blake-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"I, Daniel Blake is one of his better efforts because the story is powerfully focused and the acting is strong, which is not always the case with Loach's films."
1652,made-up-movie,Megan Lehmann,38,"Tries to be many things -- romantic comedy, mockumentary, a satire on beauty and aging -- but ends up succeeding at none. "
1653,sin-city-movie,Peter Travers,88,"The worst thing I can say about this savage, sexy and ferociously funny screen translation of three stories from Frank Miller's Sin City series of graphic novels is that it's too much of a good thing."
1654,seven-pounds-movie,A.O. Scott,0,"The most transcendently, eye-poppingly, call-your-friend-ranting-in-the-middle-of-the-night-just-to-go-over-it-one-more-time crazily awful motion pictures ever made."
1655,she-hate-me-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"The politest way to assess Spike Lee's latest polemic is to call it too ambitious. ""An unholy mess"" might come closer to the truth. "
1656,the-brothers-grimsby-movie,James Berardinelli,12,This movie is so atrocious I kept waiting for Nick Cage to show up.
1657,green-street-hooligans-movie,G. Allen Johnson,75,Terrific.
1658,all-the-money-in-the-world-movie,Kevin Harley,80,"Scott steers his ideas-rich, character-based thriller with brisk authority. Plummer and Williams bring their all."
1659,le-havre-movie,Marc Mohan,83,"Kaurismäki is a master of expressive stillness for whom inaction often speaks louder than words, and the performances he elicits are perfectly pitched, including young Miguel's."
1660,to-the-wonder-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,"Clocks in at close to two hours. It feels much longer. By comparison, Malick’s World War II epic “The Thin Red Line” tipped the scales at a whopping 170 minutes. But at least that 1998 film had people shooting at each other. There’s no such excitement here."
1661,harry-+-max-movie,Debra Birnbaum,25,"If boy bands weren't already passé, Harry and Max would finish the job."
1662,sideways-movie,Manohla Dargis,90,"Like the film itself, the performance (Giamatti's) is deeply controlled, played with restraint and with microscopic attention to detail."
1663,time-and-tide-movie,Chris Fujiwara,38,"A desperate, cynical self-parody."
1664,the-departed-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"It isn't in the same league as the director's best work, chiefly because it lacks the bravura flourishes of cinematic craft that helped make his name. But it's so vital and bloody and funny and wicked and tense and unapologetic that it feels kin to those films, which little of the director's work of the past decade has managed to pull off."
1665,the-tao-of-steve-movie,Rita Kempley,90,"Warmhearted, wonderfully witty."
1666,mothers-day-2016-movie,Glenn Kenny,10,"The movie, a goopy, glossy mess with 10 times more respect for contrived sentimentality than for film grammar, is bereft of genuinely amusing jokes — Mr. Marshall really had some nerve naming his autobiography “Wake Me When It’s Funny.”"
1667,demolition-movie,Steve Persall,83,"Vallée's movie itself begins falling apart after being so artfully put together. Yet Gyllenhaal's performance is the center that holds, making Davis' melancholic obsession and irrational acts seem like the sanest things anyone could do. His disintegration is the actor's triumph."
1668,you-can-count-on-me-movie,Staff [Not Credited],88,"The best drama you've seen about Anytown, USA, since ""American Beauty."""
1669,session-9-movie,Jay Carr,38,You couldn't ask for a better setting for a horror movie. What you could ask for is a better script.
1670,the-one-i-love-movie,Mike D'Angelo,67,"The ending is intended to be ambiguous, but it’s not too hard to guess what happened in advance, as it’s the only dramatically satisfying option. What’s no longer at all certain is what it means."
1671,die-hard-2-movie,Jay Boyar,20,Whatever small pleasure there is to be found in this loud dud is due mostly to the residual good feelings from the first film.
1672,the-maltese-falcon-movie,Otis Ferguson,90,"The Maltese Falcon is the first crime melodrama with finish, speed and bang to come along in what seems ages, and since its pattern is one of the best things Hollywood does, we have been missing it. "
1673,slumdog-millionaire-movie,Ann Hornaday,90,"Like all good fairy tales, this outsize celebration of perseverance and moral triumph contains within it a deeper idea -- in this case, the relative nature of what we think we know, and what's worth knowing at all. No doubt Dickens himself would approve."
1674,state-and-main-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,88,A snarling satire of Hollywood single-mindedness and its lack of any moral underpinning.
1675,man-on-the-train-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"The film doesn't have much of a narrative, and the ending is a little too mystical, but there's still plenty here to engage the attention of all but the most restless of movie-goers. "
1676,fur-an-imaginary-portrait-of-diane-arbus-movie,Owen Gleiberman,16,Shainberg reduces this most disturbing of all photographers to a portraitist of Halloween.
1677,bukowski-born-into-this-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"How much was legend, how much was pose, how much was real? I think it was all real, and the documentary suggests as much."
1678,seven-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,"Noticeable skill has gone into the making of Seven, but it's hard to take much pleasure in that."
1679,chariots-of-fire-movie,Jack Pitman,90,"The casting is pin point. Charleson and Cross, neither meaningful to film fans up to now, come over as plausible types rather than stereotypes. John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson contribute sharply as university officials dismayed by the upstart young Jew. Nigel Davenport is very good as the Olympic squad’s titular leader, and Patrick Magee is excellent in a brief turn as a blimpish peer of the realm."
1680,the-city-of-lost-children-movie,Shawn Levy,100,"As a fable, The City of Lost Children may not have a resonantly significant moral, but as a film, it is without a doubt the most incredible thing that the cinema has brought us this year. [22 Dec 1995]"
1681,some-velvet-morning-movie,Chuck Bowen,12,To watch the film is to wonder once again why Neil LaBute was ever taken seriously as a so-called dramatist of the gulf between the sexes.
1682,bloody-sunday-movie,Desson Thomson,100,An extraordinary film ... that's impossible to dismiss or leave unmoved.
1683,price-of-glory-movie,John Patterson,10,It's outclassed by the memory of just about every prizefighting flick you've ever seen.
1684,the-tuxedo-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"The movie is silly beyond comprehension, and even if it weren't silly, it would still be beyond comprehension."
1685,daredevil-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Mind-numbing, would-be comic-book franchise, which often seems as blind as its hero -- not to mention deaf and dumb. "
1686,compliance-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,It makes you think. And that's invaluable.
1687,billy-elliot-movie,Peter Travers,90,Bell explodes onscreen in a performance that cuts to the heart without sham tearjerking.  Look for Billy to blast off.
1688,rumor-has-it-movie,Marrit Ingman,0,"Fans of ""The Graduate"" should skip this strange comedy."
1689,88minutes-movie,James Berardinelli,25,One of the dumbest thrillers to arrive it theaters in a long time.
1690,aladdin-movie,Richard Corliss,90,"t's a movie for adults -- if they can keep up with its careering pace -- and, yes, you can take the kids. It juggles a '90s impudence with the old Disney swank and heart."
1691,the-hills-have-eyes-movie,Heidi Martinuzzi,80,"When Aja really starts in on the brutal slayings, he spares no one any comfort at all."
1692,push-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"I saw the original version of this same story 28 years ago. It was called ""Scanners"" and it blew my mind for real. Push just blows."
1693,son-of-the-mask-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,A witless and vulgar sequel.
1694,aint-them-bodies-saints-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,80,"Although at times maybe not enough happens, it’s still a satisfying homage to a golden age of American film and an original achievement in its own right."
1695,the-legend-of-hercules-movie,Louis Black,20,"While watching it, I kept thinking this was like ""47 Ronin,"" in which an unfortunate novice director was given a project way out of his or her reach. In no way was I prepared to learn it was the work of veteran Harlin."
1696,little-men-movie,Moira Macdonald,88,"Ira Sachs’ lovely, heartfelt drama ""Love Is Strange"" had at its center a New York City real-estate problem — as does his new film, the equally splendid Little Men."
1697,the-eyes-of-my-mother-movie,Lanre Bakare,20,Pesce asks viewers to go along with the absurdity while offering nothing to justify any of it. It’s a murder ballad gone out of tune.
1698,premonition-movie,Steve Davis,20,"If only Bullock could have foreseen how bad Premonition would turn out to be, she would have spared herself (and us) a lot of agony."
1699,the-bad-lieutenant-port-of-call---new-orleans-movie,Peter Rainer,91,"The marvel of Cage's performance is that, somehow, it's all of a piece. That's the marvel of the movie, too. This is one fever dream you'll remember whole."
1700,the-crossing-guard-movie,Rick Groen,38,"The result is a curious mix - a picture that simultaneously seems meanderingly loose, affording the cast plenty of performing space, and suffocatingly tight, choking off the audience from any interpretive engagement."
1701,tideland-movie,Josh Rosenblatt,11,"When they’re used to tell a story as dreary, unfocused, and exhausting as Tideland, the director’s trademark dreamscapes and disorienting camera angles feel like so much artless window dressing."
1702,two-can-play-that-game-movie,Robert Koehler,10,"Few recent movies have conceived their central female character more contemptuously -- a fanatic for a lifestyle that appears to have come from the bestselling ""The Rules."""
1703,george-of-the-jungle-movie,Mike Clark,38,"This one's aimed at those airheads who, like George, have been swinging on a grapevine and slamming into too many trees. [16 July 1997, p. 3D]"
1704,emma-movie,Keith Phipps,80,"While most literary adaptations look flat and pretty, the fine performances here set Emma apart."
1705,a-little-bit-of-heaven-movie,Nick Pinkerton,10,A Little Bit of Heaven demands miracles of its cast to keep proceedings from becoming grindingly mawkish and does not get them.
1706,terminator-3-rise-of-the-machines-movie,Peter Travers,75,"May lack the mythic pow of the 1984 original and the visionary thrill of T2, but it's a potent popcorn movie that digs in its hooks and doesn't let go until an ending that ODs on apocalyptic hoo-ha. "
1707,the-hangover-part-ii-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"Hangover II is more like a spitball meeting, a series of ideas that might, in theory, be good enough for a sequel, than it is an actual movie."
1708,diablo-movie,Chuck Bowen,25,It inelegantly attempts to infuse a standard revenge western with the gravitas of a war veteran's coming-home odyssey.
1709,larry-crowne-movie,Rex Reed,25,"Congenial is the word for Larry Crowne, but it's as flat as an ironing board."
1710,split-movie,Brian Truitt,75,What resonates more is his more subtle exploration of how people deal differently with trauma and the power of connection. That message — and a captivating McAvoy — will stick with you long past the thrills of a cool twist.
1711,harry-brown-movie,Peter Rainer,16,"Caine acts dignified throughout, but there's no way to dignify dreck."
1712,the-women-movie,Richard Schickel,0,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
1713,i-now-pronounce-you-chuck-larry-movie,Toddy Burton,0,"A movie full of weak moments, contrived to the point of painful."
1714,red-movie,Roger Moore,63,"Red has enough acting flourishes and incidental action pleasures to make it an adrenalin-jacked giggle, if not exactly the romp one so fervently expects."
1715,the-girl-with-all-the-gifts-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"The movie is a coming-of-age story, but whose age is coming? That's the profound question we're left with, in a stellar adaptation that balances gore with black humor, ethical quandary, hope and—yes—plenty of brains."
1716,mixed-nuts-movie,Peter Rainer,0,"Mixed Nuts is a farcical whirligig that doesn't whirl. It's energetically unfunny, like ""Radioland Murders,"" and, like that film, it boasts top-flight talent. Maybe the idea of making a comedy about a suicide prevention center just got to everyone-it's a bummed-out comedy about being bummed out. [21 Dec 1994, p.1]"
1717,flatliners-2017-movie,John DeFore,30,"Instead of improving on the original's visualization of the liminal state between life and death, director Niels Arden Oplev turns the conceit into just another excuse for rote haunting, making this Flatliners often indistinguishable from its 2017 thriller peers."
1718,the-perfect-game-movie,Tom Russo,63,"Much like a Sox starter struggling for the first couple of innings before settling down, The Perfect Game takes a while to get to the parts worth cheering."
1719,staying-alive-movie,Jay Carr,25,"Staying Alive, the sequel to John Travolta's ""Saturday Night Fever,"" plays like wet cement. [16 Jul 1983]"
1720,ben-hur-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"There’s a fatally miscast lead (Jack Huston, you are no Charlton Heston), cut-rate special effects, reams of eyeball-glazing dialogue, and a schmaltzy “inspirational” script that pointlessly alters the story in ways that make absolutely no sense."
1721,knight-of-cups-movie,Rex Reed,0,"With the corpse of a nightmare called Knight of Cups, I have finally given up on Terrence Malick. This dog of a film is as riveting and fascinating as a walk-in bathtub."
1722,very-bad-things-movie,David Sterritt,12,"A dark comedy about a bachelor party gone awry, it is excessively violent, ghoulish, and gory. Very Bad Things is lack-of-taste taken to the extreme."
1723,gentlemen-broncos-movie,John Anderson,12,"What Michael Bay did for the Hollywood blockbuster with his second ""Transformers"" movie, Jared Hess has now done for the low-budget indie with Gentlemen Broncos -- namely, stain an entire genre with a sense of soulless calculation."
1724,green-room-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"Patrick Stewart has a blast playing against type as a soft-spoken white supremacist holding a punk rock band as his temporary prisoners in Jeremy Saulnier’s nicely crafted, low-budget comedy-thriller."
1725,remember-the-titans-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,20,A feel-good movie only in the sense that it wants to reassure today's white people about our own enlightenment and how far we've come in the evolution of our attitudes about race.
1726,2-fast-2-furious-movie,Charles Taylor,10,"It's a terrible movie, stuck in plot idiocies and big, noisy set pieces like a tire mired in mud. "
1727,frequency-movie,Jack Mathews,100,"One of the most skillful, mesmerizing, tense and satisfying time-warp thrillers ever made."
1728,marjorie-prime-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"It’s this hunger for the entirety of a person’s life that makes Marjorie Prime one of the most riveting, moving films of the year."
1729,baby-driver-movie,Richard Roeper,100,"It all works. All of it. The music, the performances, the twists and turns in the plot, the sheer energy and life force of the movie."
1730,stranded-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,25,"Stranded is unmistakably bad, but somewhat enjoyable, especially for viewers who have a soft spot for the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" favorite ""Space Mutiny."""
1731,boyhood-movie,Liam Lacey,100,"Linklater’s film is very much its own hybrid creature. While the dramatic scaffolding is lightly drawn, it becomes apparent that Linklater has organized his material along certain themes, most notably that of the passage of time and the dream life of childhood."
1732,bronson-movie,J. Hoberman,30,"Bronson is essentially a faux-operatic, music hall turn--a larky, lumpen version of ""Lola Montès."""
1733,syndromes-and-a-century-movie,V.A. Musetto,75,"Strictly for art-house types, particularly those familiar with the director, who makes no concessions to mainstream audiences. You have to abandon any preconceived notions about movies and allow your mind to be seduced by the mystifying, occasionally humorous world of a one-of-a-kind filmmaker. You might even find yourself becoming a fan."
1734,double-take-2001-movie,Kevin Maynard,10,Who the heck green-lit this garbage heap anyway?
1735,collateral-beauty-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"Pretentious and manipulative, the movie bludgeons viewers with its new age philosophizing and its desire to be considered meaningful."
1736,rough-night-movie,Katie Rife,67,"To compare Rough Night to another relatively recent female-led comedy, the film incorporates its violence with less tonal whiplash than in the 2013 Sandra Bullock/Melissa McCarthy comedy ""The Heat,"" not only because of the tone set by the hard-R dialogue, but also because the dead body jokes are more ""Weekend At Bernie’s"" than anything."
1737,a-long-way-down-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"If there is any humor to be gleaned from this concept, it is nowhere to be found in a movie so shoddily made that there is little continuity between scenes and not a laugh or even a titter."
1738,the-phenom-movie,Jared Mobarak,75,"Inventiveness, creativity, and complete disregard for mainstream sensibilities are what make the director so captivating."
1739,phantoms-movie,Ruthe Stein,25,"A horror movie that has the distinction of not even being scary... Although Koontz wrote the screenplay, the suspense for which he is supposed to be famous doesn't translate to the screen."
1740,killers-movie,Staff (Not credited),10,"Is it some monstrosity of awfulness, as its lack of advance screening suggested? No, that would imply at least a spark of some kind. This is just an empty summer hodgepodge of stale romantic comedy exchanges, witlessness and lackluster action."
1741,the-adventures-of-robin-hood-re-release-movie,Elliott Stein,100,"Robin Hood is movie pageantry at its best, done in the grand manner of silent spectacles, brimming over with the sort of primitive energy that drew people to the movies in the first place."
1742,together-2001-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"Free love, vegetarianism and lack of personal property are the rule."
1743,beastly-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,"More than lives up to its name with ultra-campy performances, high-glucose direction, laughable dialogue, cheesy effects and a back-lot simulation of a Manhattan street that wouldn't pass muster on an after-school special."
1744,love-mercy-movie,Michael Phillips,100,It's the best musical biopic in decades. 
1745,teaching-mrs-tingle-movie,Christopher Brandon,0,One of the worst movies released this year.
1746,the-big-bang-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,10,"Without Antonio Banderas, The Big Bang would be a whimper of a movie, too awful to watch."
1747,good-burger-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"Movies don't get worse than Good Burger, a wretched little comedy. It's a movie that inspires wonder -- at how it got made and released."
1748,light-it-up-movie,Matt Kelsey,25,Would have been better suited as a television movie of the week.
1749,woman-on-top-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"The mind will be starved for subtlety, wit and substance."
1750,fantastic-four-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,The result is a movie groping for a comic tone while its FX machinery spews vast clouds of visual gibberish.
1751,corky-romano-movie,Joe Leydon,10,"Ranks as the most slapdash comedic star vehicle to hit screens since Harland Williams misfired with the career-stalling ""RocketMan."""
1752,red-road-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,75,The movie's intense focus skillfully exposes the raw pain just under the skin of a seemingly ordinary citizen.
1753,city-of-gold-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"It's a tasty primer on the man, the eater, the critic and the city."
1754,the-aviator-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,80,"Scorsese has crafted a rip-roaringly gorgeous-looking, beautifully acted biographical epic.  But while firing on all cylinders, there's something oddly distancing about the picture."
1755,imagine-that-movie,Gary Goldstein,63,"Despite an overly broad third act, one can't fault the film's message of family unity, underscored by a memorable use of the Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love."""
1756,clay-pigeons-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,70,"Upon this fine mess shines Janeane Garofalo like a ray of sarcastic sunlight as FBI agent Shelby...With her gift for sweet bile, the sardonic Garofalo makes every second on screen a treasure to be cherished."
1757,the-new-guy-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"Feckless and crude without any particularly funny redeeming value. If there's anything more to this poor excuse of a movie than immediately meets the eye, I'll get back to you."
1758,the-war-zone-movie,Shawn Levy,100,"A masterfully varied set of images, paces and moods."
1759,something-in-the-air-movie,Justin Chang,100,"Decidedly not revolutionary cinema, Something in the Air instead quietly demystifies its subject. The tone of the piece is wryly affectionate but never indulgent; the experiences depicted feel emotionally true and lived-in without ever catching the viewer up in a rush of intoxication or excitement. "
1760,the-love-witch-movie,Robert Abele,85,"For fans of exquisitely conjured nostalgia, dosed liberally with a modern attitude, The Love Witch is a velvety melodramatic treat, and a real calling card for Biller’s playfully immersive gifts. Bring your gaze, whatever your gender."
1761,christmas-with-the-kranks-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Egregiously mediocre and flagrantly ill-conceived in every department, this is, truly, the cinematic equivalent of finding a single solitary Saltine in your stocking and a pair of old tube socks beneath the tree. Humbug! "
1762,gravity-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"While the tension never lets up for a second, how you respond to the boundary-fudging and wildly improbable ending of Gravity – meaning both how it makes you feel and how you interpret it – will determine whether you think the movie is a genuine pop masterpiece or a canny artifice. Maybe there’s no difference."
1763,the-lone-ranger-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,Johnny Depp's Tonto wears a dead crow on his head in The Lone Ranger. The star himself carries a dead movie on his shoulders.
1764,high-school-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,20,"Instead of putting the high in high school, this film is the kind of drug movie that gives pot smokers a bad name. "
1765,only-the-strong-survive-movie,James Sullivan ,25,Sometimes the story just lies there like an old cat in the sun. 
1766,shirley-valentine-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"If there is a shred of plausibility in the film, it comes from Bernard Hill's performance as Shirley Valentine's husband. He isn't a bad bloke, just a tired and indifferent one, and when he follows his wife to Greece at the end of the film there are a few moments so truthful that they show up the artifice of the rest."
1767,push-movie,Kyle Smith,12,A grubby cut-price sci-fi thriller.
1768,the-white-ribbon-movie,Claudia Puig,63,"An artful examination of a small town and small-mindedness and the potential for full-blown, large-scale evil. But it's strangely bloodless."
1769,dinosaur-movie,Ann Hornaday,38,"Offers jaw-dropping visuals, but its troubling images of violence may cause this revolutionary effort to miss the evolutionary boat."
1770,leap-year-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"This film is unquestionably the most unromantic and downright despairing romcom since ""Made of Honor"" or, possibly, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"""
1771,made-in-america-movie,Joe Leydon,70,"The pic is less than fully satisfying as a conventional performance cavalcade, but sustains considerable interest as a behind-the-scenes overview of a musically and culturally diverse event."
1772,fed-up-movie,Manohla Dargis,80,"A whirlwind of talking heads, found footage, scary statistics and cartoonish graphics, the movie is a fast, coolly incensed investigation into why people are getting fatter."
1773,king-arthur-movie,David Edelstein,30,"King Arthur is profoundly stupid and inept, but it's an endless source of giggles once you realize that its historical revisionism has nothing to do with archeological discoveries and everything to do with the fact that no one at Disney would green-light an old-fashioned talky love triangle with a hero who dies and an adulterous heroine who ends up in a nunnery. "
1774,the-godfather-part-iii-movie,Hal Hinson,10,"The Godfather Part III isn't just a disappointment, it's a failure of heartbreaking proportions... It makes you wish it had never been made."
1775,blackkklansman-movie,Blake Goble,100,BlacKkKlansman is a well-formed and compelling work of pulp escapism.
1776,geostorm-movie,Peter Debruge,10,"The only thing more reliable than bad weather is bad movies, and in that respect, Geostorm is right on forecast."
1777,28-weeks-later-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"I give the slight edge to the first movie because I prefer Boyle's craft to Fresnadillo's, but the action is more intense here, and I greeted the thought of a third film -- virtually assured in the closing shots -- with a little yip of ""Yes!"" Likely you will, too."
1778,on-the-line-movie,Robert Wilonsky,20,"This pallid little ditty, like the rest of Lance Bass and pals' oeuvre, is soulless, banal and derivative."
1779,batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-movie,Jonathan L. Fischer,10,"To put it delicately, this comics fan hated Batman v Superman with the fury of a thousand red-dwarf suns. Blunt, humorless, and baffling, it collides the brutish directorial stamp of its director (he of 300 and Watchmen fame) with the most shameless instincts of our latter-day superhero franchise bubble. "
1780,raising-helen-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,You are likely to encounter more surprises on the way to the bathroom each morning than you do in this film.
1781,showtime-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,20,There's so little urgency to the plot that one eventually feels not even the actors and filmmakers believe for a second in what's going on.
1782,madison-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"By the time this corn festival is over, you'll be crying out for the relative toughness of the average Jimmy Stewart film."
1783,neither-heaven-nor-earth-movie,Ela Bittencourt,75,"While he may indulge in the occasional programmatic jump scare, writer-director Clément Cogitore ultimately heaves his debut feature closer to the realm of psychological terror, understanding that there's nothing more frightening or darker than the human mind."
1784,the-wedding-ringer-movie,Kiva Reardon,0,This so-called comedy unfolds with embarrassing desperation and mind-numbing vulgarity.
1785,chunhyangdyun-movie,Manohla Dargis,90,"The film is unabashedly sexy, and its heady romanticism feels as right and as unaffected as Im's bold use of color and his equally bold decision to tell the story through traditional pansori narration."
1786,passion-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"With no heat at all and a woefully disjointed cast, De Palma’s danse macabre never catches fire."
1787,unsane-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,12,"A straightforward, B-movie horror flick — “The Snake Pit” without the prestige — complete with intentional overdosing, electroshock torture and patients threatening each other with a sharpened spoons, when they’re not either screaming or catatonic. It also is very, very bad. "
1788,the-generals-daughter-movie,William Arnold,25,"So bloated, self-righteous and exploitative, it's hard to imagine anyone staying to the end, much less demanding a sequel."
1789,love-actually-movie,Jonathan Foreman,63,"By far the best single performance in the film - and it is really, really terrific, utterly believable and moving - is by Emma Thompson. To the extent that there is genuine feeling in the movie that doesn't feel slickly manipulative, it's in the scenes involving her character."
1790,10-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Blake Edwards's ""10"" is perhaps the first comedy about terminal yearning. Like all great comedies, it deals with emotions very close to our hearts: In this case, the unutterable poignance of a man's desire for a woman he cannot have."
1791,mistress-america-movie,Steve Persall,91,"Mistress America is certainly funnier and sunnier than While We're Young, mostly thanks to Gerwig, America's dizzy, dazzling new girl on the side."
1792,warm-bodies-movie,Betsy Sharkey,80,In doing a little genre bending of romantic schmaltz and horror cheese - some fundamental zombie mythology is turned on its head - the film breathes amusing new life into both.
1793,house-of-flying-daggers-movie,Michael Sragow,100,By turns breathtaking and heartbreaking.
1794,the-nutcracker-movie,Ty Burr,0,This is first-degree cultural homicide.
1795,pan-movie,Alonso Duralde,15,A thoroughly unpleasant experience.
1796,machine-gun-preacher-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"The events of the movie may be a little bit true, or a lot, but hardly any of it plays that way."
1797,wild-hogs-movie,Rick Groen,0,A 0-star Comedy that is nonetheless guaranteed to rake in multimillions.
1798,rampage-movie,Brian Tallerico,63,"When Johnson is doing that movie action star thing he does so well and giant animals are going enormous-mano-a-enormous-mano, there’s undeniably goofy fun to be had. You just have to be patient during the downtime."
1799,hell-or-high-water-movie,Calvin Wilson,100,The year’s most exhilarating film. 
1800,salvation-boulevard-movie,Ian Buckwalter,30,"Without the humor, the stereotypes that define these characters aren't satirical; they're just mean-spirited and dull. "
1801,amores-perros-movie,Peter Rainer,90,"It's a truly prodigious piece of work, resembling a career summation far more than a maiden voyage."
1802,still-walking-movie,Anthony Kaufman,90,"Koreeda imbues the story with such specificity, tactility, and humanity that yet another movie about a dysfunctional family reunion becomes a cinematic tone poem."
1803,blind-spot-hitlers-secretary-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,80,"So the monstrous twentieth century recedes into libraries; and so a small cog in the mechanism of that monstrosity bequeaths us her memory of it in a quiet, measured way. "
1804,the-love-witch-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,90,"Anna Biller's ripe, vibrant The Love Witch is an act of reclamation — and love. "
1805,starting-out-in-the-evening-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"We are slowly and mightily drawn into this intimate story, which is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally moving."
1806,homicide-movie,Angie Errigo,80,"As a psychological drama, it's a sophisticated, gripping piece that unusually leaves you wanting to go on past its unsettling conclusion."
1807,ohorten-movie,Marc Mohan,83,"Director Bent Hamer (""Factotum"") keeps things drily amusing throughout."
1808,paragraph-175-movie,Dennis Harvey,90,The definitive screen chronicle to date of homosexual persecution under the Third Reich.
1809,breaking-and-entering-movie,Scott Tobias,75,"After being strapped down by a run of elegant, high-class literary adaptations--""The English Patient,"" ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" and ""Cold Mountain""--writer-director Anthony Minghella liberates himself in Breaking And Entering, his first wholly original screenplay since his piercing, minor-key debut feature ""Truly, Madly, Deeply."""
1810,brothers-2005-movie,Rick Groen,88,"A powerful, brutal, funny, tragic, vibrant, very human movie."
1811,friend-request-movie,Mark Dujsik,38,"When she least expects it, the face of the cat transforms into a monstrous one, with sharp, pointy teeth and a roar. Yes, this is going to be one of those horror movies."
1812,chocolat-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"It's built of such exquisite craft -- the acting, the decor, the photography, the music -- that to refuse it is to refuse the very sensations that draw us to art, romance and maybe even life itself."
1813,northfork-movie,Owen Gleiberman,16,"It has that vintage Polish pace, their signature arch pomposity and rhythmless weirdness, only this time the brothers had to go and make a cosmic allegory of American dreams."
1814,snow-day-movie,Peter Stack,25,"Chase is so dull in this film, he looks as if he's sleepwalking."
1815,dear-frankie-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"The bold long shot near the end of Dear Frankie allows the film to move straight as an arrow toward its emotional truth, without a single word or plot manipulation to distract us."
1816,the-bourne-legacy-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"The Bourne series ended with the last installment, and now comes a 135-minute death rattle called The Bourne Legacy. It's a peculiar movie, both over-plotted and under-plotted, encumbered by layers of detail and yet with no details invested in or developed."
1817,the-little-death-movie,Christy Lemire,38,There is simultaneously too much and not enough going on in writer/director/co-star Josh Lawson’s feature debut. He crams in too many people and plot lines but offers too little in the way of character development and credible emotion.
1818,the-wild-parrots-of-telegraph-hill-movie,Staff (Not credited),91,"It's a special, strangely soothing movie experience that wonderfully celebrates the intricate diversity of life on Earth and the profound emotional bond that can exist between man and beast."
1819,transformers-dark-of-the-moon-movie,Peter Travers,0,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon - high on any list of the worst blockbusters ever - is a movie bereft of wit, wonder, imagination, and any genuine reason for being. Watching it makes you die a little inside. "
1820,an-american-affair-movie,Dan Zak,70,"The film rises above its conventions. Just when it seems to be a fable of sexual initiation, An American Affair pivots away from sex. Just when it seems to be a re-dredging of the Kennedy mystique, it pushes past history. Thoughtfully and imperfectly, it dramatizes the flight from childhood, the surrender to adulthood and the pieces of us that survive."
1821,no-good-deed-2014-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"Elba, who recruited his former Luther director Miller into the project, gives the film more dignity than it deserves, and Henson delivers a performance of complex emotional shadings. But their fine work is utterly wasted in this B-movie exploitation thriller that would barely make for passable viewing on late night cable television."
1822,the-bag-man-movie,Christopher Schobert,0,"The Bag Man is, in final analysis, truly disheartening."

1825,no-escape-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"For all its genuine thrill-ride gestalt, No Escape completely short-shrifts its Southeast Asian players. There’s exactly one Asian character of note, a Kenny Rogers-loving tuk-tuk driver (Boonthanakit). Everyone else is a nameless victim of the equally nameless mob."
1826,stripes-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Stripes is an anarchic slob movie, a celebration of all that is irreverent, reckless, foolhardy, undisciplined, and occasionally scatological. It's a lot of fun."

1835,intolerable-cruelty-movie,David Rooney,70,"A thoroughly entertaining comedy about love, lawyers and fat divorce settlements. While a slight imbalance in the romantic formula stops it just short of truly soaring, the crackling dialogue and buoyant wordplay make this a delightful throwback to classic screwball comedies."

1842,book-club-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,30,"These supremely talented women are put through embarrassing paces by director and co-writer Bill Holderman. It’s meant to be a film about a reawakening of desire, and thus life. It turns out to be a wince-inducing mess."
1843,tristram-shandy-a-cock-and-bull-story-movie,Liam Lacey,88,"Can a little-read 18th-century literary masterpiece be food-spittingly funny? Can it also include contemporary English actors riffing about their bad teeth, getting drunk and kissing their personal assistants? The answer is yes, as long as you agree that the best way to adapt an original book is with a correspondingly original film."

1846,the-lone-ranger-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"It represents 2 1/2 of the longest hours on record, a jumbled botch that is so confused in its purpose and so charmless in its effect that it must be seen to be believed, but better yet, no.

1852,the-party-movie,Peter Bradshaw,80,"Unassuming and old-fashioned funny entertainment isn’t exactly what we associate with this film-maker, but that’s what she has very satisfyingly served up here. It’s not especially resonant or profound but it is observant and smart, with some big laughs in the dialogue. The whole thing is enjoyably absurd though not precisely absurdist."
1853,the-whole-ten-yards-movie,Jonathan Foreman,12,"Bereft of inspiration, the agonizingly witless screenplay - blamed by the credits on George Gallo - resorts to pathetic cheap jokes about flatulence and impotence, lame slapstick and that juvenile gag about the horror of two men waking up naked in the same bed.

1887,buffy-the-vampire-slayer-movie,Staff (Not Credited),20,Director Fran Rubel Kuzui's frenzied mistrust of her material is almost total. Somebody should have given her a garlic necklace -- or a Miltown -- and told her to chill out.

1890,spectre-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"One of the great satisfactions of Spectre is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone’s personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person."
1891,paul-blart-mall-cop-2-movie,Alonso Duralde,6,"The humor level in the film is so moribund that it doesn’t even inspire groans or eye-rolling; instead, it figuratively puts its hands on your shoulders and pushes you deeper into your theater seat until you’ve been completely subdued by all the nothingness it has to offer."

1895,tin-men-movie,Hal Lipper,80,"Writer-director Levinson returns to Baltimore (his home town) with a perceptive, rueful comedy called Tin Men.

1905,southern-comfort-1981-movie,David Ansen,70,"At times Southern Comfort seems like a kind of war game itself--an academic exercise, perfectly executed but a little cut and dried.

1906,10000-bc-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"One doesn't expect intelligent scripting or deep characterization from Roland Emmerich, but the film's lack of energy, poor special effects, and monotonous pacing lead to an inescapable conclusion: 10,000 B.C. isn't only brain-dead, it's COMPLETELY dead. It's inert and without a heartbeat."

1912,afterlife-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"The dialogue is clumsy, the tone swings between somber and silly and the whole bizarre venture eventually succumbs to rigor mortis."
1913,extreme-ops-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"Ops is too brain-dead to play the incognito war criminal segment for comedy, although when Will is seen thumbing through the pages of a newspaper called USA Daily, the picture has inadvertently tumbled down a Mad magazine wormhole."
1914,cell-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,30,"Dated, despondent and pretty much a disaster, Cell plays like a series of nods to other science fiction-horror hybrids, notably “The Matrix” (1999) and Philip Kaufman’s 1978 remake of “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.”"
1915,25th-hour-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,90,"The film persuades us to think long and hard about what prison means, and Lee has shaped it like a poem that builds into an epic lament, especially in a beautiful and tragic closing that risks absurdity to achieve the sublime."
1916,the-real-blonde-movie,Lisa Alspector,30,"If DiCillo had been going anywhere with this, I'd have gladly followed. But setting up petty ironies and pathetic references to Woody Allen seems to be his only goal. "
1917,fair-game-movie,Gary Dauphin,10,Cindy Crawford is not the worst thing about Fair Game. Her fully poseable action-figure performance is about what you'd expect: studied and empty at the same time. Far worse is Fair Game's script. [14 Nov 1995]
1918,lawrence-of-arabia-re-release-movie,David Sterritt,100,"In short, they don't make 'em like this one anymore. Viewing it is like taking a time machine to a movie age that was more naive than our own in some ways, more sophisticated and ambitious in others."

1920,jumper-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Jumper, based on the novel by Steven Gould, re-defines -- downward -- the notion of dreadful. It does so by dispensing with everything a movie needs for a shot at being merely awful. Dramatic development? None. Entertaining dialogue? Ditto. Internal logic? Puhleez. Intriguing characters? No characters, thus no intrigue. Interesting performances? Essentially none, though with an asterisk."
1921,till-human-voices-wake-us-movie,Desson Thomson,30,I'd recommend you actively or passively forget this one. 
1922,debs-movie,Stephen Holden,20,"The film has no idea of how to develop its one-joke premise. The tepid love scenes are as erotically charged as a home movie of a little girl hugging her Barbie doll, and the satire as cutting as the blunt edge of a plastic butter knife."

1942,chasing-madoff-movie,David Denby,70,"The movie ends in bitterness. Unable to prevent catastrophe, the most honorable man in this entire affair - an outcast among frauds and the cannily acquiescent - considers himself a failure."
1943,lawless-heart-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"By allowing the stories to play off one another and allowing layers of meaning to accumulate before we even notice them, the filmmakers capture some of the essential strangeness of life -- the way our relations are governed by laws that remain invisible to us until art reveals their workings."
1944,the-tempest-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,20,"A tiresome mess that's completely bereft of a quiet moment in speech or manner, The Tempest aches for the wisdom of discipline."

1957,victoria-movie,Nigel M Smith,100,"Despite the strong performances, it’s Schipper’s single-shot conceit - and the fact that he and his team pulled it off with aplomb - that makes Victoria such a bracing triumph. While the entire enterprise is inarguably a stunt, Victoria manages to overwhelm in ways that few films do."

1967,dylan-dog-dead-of-night-movie,Roger Moore,25,"Its star, Brandon Routh, is just as miscast as a droll, world-weary ""investigator of the undead"" as he was as a boy-Man of Steel back in 2006."
1968,queen-of-the-desert-movie,Neil Young,16,"Choosing to make a film about such an astonishing, rule-disregarding, inspirational woman and concentrate on her relationships with fellas...is questionable enough as it is – but if Herzog had managed to properly dramatize those relationships, he might have conceivably gotten away with it, rather than ending up with this exercise in syrupy, (sometimes cringe-inducing) banality."
1969,hidden-movie,Deborah Young,80,"A tightly plotted and paced thriller whose not-so-hidden agenda is to expose the bad conscience of the world's haves toward its have-nots, ""Hidden"" is one of Austrian helmer Michael Haneke's most watchable and pungent works."
1970,shower-movie,Jack Mathews,88,"Intimate, deeply affecting family drama."
1971,only-human-movie,Wesley Morris,75,A dinner-from-hell comedy about a pretty Jewish Spaniard who brings a nice Palestinian guy home to her outspoken Madrid family.
1972,twelve-years-a-slave-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"Intense, unflinching, bold in its simplicity and radical in its use of image, sound and staging, 12 Years a Slave in many ways is the defining epic so many have longed for to examine — if not cauterize — America’s primal wound."
1973,stage-beauty-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"For every thing that Stage Beauty does right, it fumbles at least one other element, resulting in a movie-going experience that is of the glass half-full/half-empty variety."
1974,heavens-gate-movie,Ian Freer,100,"In depicting the Johnson County War of 1892 (immigrants versus cattle barons), Michael Cimino delivers soaring ambition and scale, but always syringed with a deep sense of regret."
1975,unfaithful-movie,James Berardinelli,63,The good points about Unfaithful can't overcome the movie's eventual downward spiral.
1976,paradise-now-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"The film is better than the recent ""The War Within,"" which tried for the same things, but ultimately, and perhaps unavoidably, we are left face to face with the unknowable."
1977,pawn-shop-chronicles-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"Despite its noteworthy cast who presumably had some time to fill between better gigs, this is the sort of instantly disposable B-movie effort that Quentin Tarantino would have chucked in the wastebasket after a first draft. "
1978,town-country-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Ragging on Town & Country is like shooting a school of fish that's already belly up in a fetid barrel, but the movie's ineptitude is almost incomparable."
1979,you-the-living-movie,A.O. Scott,100,"The film is slow, rigorously morose and often painful in its blunt reckoning of disappointment and failure. It is also extremely funny."
1980,identity-thief-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,67,"The fault, I think, isn't in our stars but in the script, running up a huge comedy tab the likable players can't pay off. "
1981,tim-and-erics-billion-dollar-movie-movie,Glenn Whipp,30,Cult comedy team Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim take the mechanics of the Funny or Die website and stretch it past the breaking point with their movie.
1982,empire-records-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"If the movie is a lost cause, it may at least showcase actors who have better things ahead of them."
1983,saving-mr-banks-movie,Ty Burr,75,"Because it’s a Hollywood movie from a major corporation looking fondly at itself, it concludes that, while art may heal our psychic wounds, craftsmanship and commerce heal them better."
1984,ferris-buellers-day-off-movie,Julie Salamon,0,"One of the least appealing movies I've seen in a while.... When a member of the audience belched loudly, that got the biggest laugh of the day. [17 June 1986, p.E26]"
1985,catch-me-if-you-can-movie,Ty Burr,88,Nothing if not a celebration of our willingness to be gulled by life's charming strangers.
1986,keep-the-change-movie,Roger Moore,63,"“Change” finds humanity, a sweet moment or two (rare) and some good-natured laughs at the misperceptions and misunderstandings that occur when on-the-spectrum meets off-the-spectrum, and even among people all on the same wavelength."
1987,furious-7-movie,Chris Nashawaty,75,No one forks over 10 bucks to see one of these flicks for its logic. We go for the bananas demolition-derby mayhem. Furious 7 delivers that with the direct visceral rush of an EpiPen.
1988,bran-nue-dae-movie,Roger Moore,75,"It's a little racy for our ""High School Musical"" set. But Bran Nue Dae (say it out loud) will play anywhere fans like a musical so cute you want to pinch its cheeks."
1989,tie-me-up!-tie-me-down!-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,"An offensive premise and a pathetic, almost pleading desire to outrage our sensibilities with it."
1990,juno-movie,Lou Lumenick,100,"Hollywood's Woman of the Year is a pregnant 16-year-old, the incredibly hip, smart-mouthed and totally endearing heroine of the wise and witty Juno."
1991,wilbur-wants-to-kill-himself-movie,Kimberley Jones,78,"The film moves so subtly, in fact, and so seamlessly between wry humor and the emotional wreckage of life-or-death, that it was with some shock that I found myself weeping halfway through the film. "
1992,skyline-movie,James Berardinelli,12,Just plain bad. Boring. Unwatchable. 
1993,harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-i-movie,Roger Moore,88,"The first third is brisk and witty, the middle third gloomy and the finale of Part 1 not so much a cliffhanger as a grim, inspiring tease, a masterly build-up to put ""I can't wait for part 2"" on every Muggles' lips."
1994,midnight-special-movie,Dan Jolin,80,Nichols mounts impressive visual effects and frantic bursts of action.... But the film’s strength is in its humanity rather than its super-humanity.
1995,i-spit-on-your-grave-movie,Michael Ordona,10,"For most, there will be no adrenaline rush from fear or thrill, or vicarious release from seeing tormentors tormented; one leaves feeling sad. Sad that this is what ""entertainment"" has come to. Come on, filmmakers. Can't you do better?"
1996,she-hate-me-movie,Peter Rainer,0,"Spike Lee’s She Hate Me is his worst movie ever--even worse than ""Bamboozled,"" his self-serving indictment of modern minstrelsy, which at least was worth arguing about."
1997,the-a-team-movie,Roger Moore,63,The players embrace this for the lark it is. Their pleasure in going this gonzo spills off the screen.
1998,seven-movie,Peter Travers,70,It's not the identity of the killer that gives Seven its kick -- it's the way Fincher raises mystery to the level of moral provocation.
1999,chappie-movie,Michael Phillips,0,A misjudgment from metallic head to titanium toe.
2000,silent-light-movie,Liam Lacey,88,"Much of what happens in Silent Light can feel painstakingly mundane: milking cows, harvesting wheat, a long drive at night in and out of shadows. Yet throughout, there's a sense of something ominous impending, and while it remains gentle, the ending is genuinely startling."
2001,the-good-lie-movie,Stephen Holden,80,"For all its softening, The Good Lie, like “Monsieur Lazhar,” has a core of decency, humanity and good will that feels authentic. You won’t curse yourself for occasionally tearing up."
2002,the-girl-on-the-train-2016-movie,Justin Chang,30,"The empathy that Taylor summoned so effortlessly in his previous films feels strained and unpersuasive here, and moments that should be lacerating...are overplayed to ghastly effect."
2003,identity-thief-movie,Ann Hornaday,25,"McCarthy’s willingness to go to the mat notwithstanding, it’s viewers who are likely left feeling punched in the gut."
2004,the-war-of-the-roses-movie,Peter Stack,75,"Although the movie goes too far, you can hardly get enough of its delicious atmosphere - and of Turner, in particular, who has never looked better on the big screen. [8 Dec 1989]"
2005,song-of-the-sea-movie,Suzanne Condie Lambert,90,Song of the Sea is a lyrical treat for those willing to sit still and let it wash over them.
2006,spotlight-movie,Roger Moore,100,"If history’s tide runs against the Globe, at least those who worked there have the satisfaction of exposing a global wrong, and helping to end it. And they have McCarthy’s film, one of the best pictures of 2015, as a permanent record, a tribute in cinematic form, to their art and craft in its finest hour."
2007,scream-3-movie,Robert Wilonsky,30,"It's time to run, screaming."

2009,support-the-girls-movie,Carson Lund,88,The film celebrates the unrecognized willpower and perseverance that undergirds low-wage service work in this country.
2010,lady-bird-movie,Eric Kohn,91,"Lady Bird is both snarky and sincere — a touching, markedly feminine ode to growing up that never takes its familiarity for granted. Gerwig earns the ability to make this rite-of-passage saga her own."
2011,the-ladies-man-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,Insulting to audience and cast alike.
2012,war-inc-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,"A film that, in attempting to ridicule the Bush administration, finally just settles for being ridiculous itself."
2013,milk-movie,Lou Lumenick,100,"Smiling more than in all of his movies since ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" combined, Penn goes way deep and soulful in a highly ingratiating performance that's the one to beat for the Best Actor Oscar."
2014,fathers-daughters-movie,Ed Gonzalez,12,The film's weird reformulation of the Electra complex is nothing short of a sexist fantasy of salvation.
2015,an-inconvenient-sequel-truth-to-power-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,63,The new documentary about Al Gore’s continued climate crusade lacks urgency.
2016,hellboy-ii-the-golden-army-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,Hugely inventive -- and smashingly beautiful.
2017,mortdecai-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,0,"Johnny Depp has done so much for us. Let us now return the favor and pretend Mortdecai, a disastrously misjudged career low, never existed."
2018,beasts-of-the-southern-wild-movie,Peter Debruge,100,A stunning debut that finds its dandelion-haired heroine fighting rising tides and fantastic creatures in a mythic battle against modernity.
2019,kadosh-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,78,"Raises fascinating question within a compelling narrative framework, and is also intriguing for the glimpse it provides into the inner workings of Orthodox Judaism."
2020,jack-reacher-never-go-back-movie,Richard Roeper,38,The whole thing is just so sloppy and dumb and overflowing with clichés.
2021,only-god-forgives-movie,Rex Reed,0,"In Cannes, one wag described it as  “cinematic defecation” in print. I’d like to top that one, but as James Agee used to say, I know when I’m licked."
2022,dead-man-on-campus-movie,Keith Phipps,10,"It's all handled so poorly that it comes off as more ghoulish than anything else, although those who find the word ""bong"" instantly entertaining and are easily distracted by the presence of flickering images may be amused."
2023,grown-ups-movie,Scott Tobias,16,"If Grown Ups were any lazier or more slapdash, it'd be a home movie."
2024,mash-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,"Clever camera setups, Altman's patented overlapping dialogue, wonderful sight gags and situations, and universally fine ensemble performances combine to make this one the most enjoyable war-themed films ever."
2025,support-the-girls-movie,Sam Adams,90,"It’s a movie whose minor characters are cleanly etched without resorting to types, so richly detailed that you can imagine them living full lives off-screen, yet it reminds you that one of the virtues of movies is, or at least can be, their conciseness."
2026,birth-movie,Ty Burr,38,Such a meticulously wrought piece of hokum that it's both easy to admire and impossible to warm up to. 
2027,dom-hemingway-movie,Jordan Hoffman,85,"There are countless clever dialogue parries as well as some quite outstanding rants. It definitely takes the movie outside of the world of pure realism, but the theatricality is well worth it."
2028,before-sunset-movie,Manohla Dargis,100,"Because Linklater now wears his heart on his sleeve, he has made a film that in its joy, optimism and aesthetic achievement keeps faith with American cinema at its finest."
2029,moonlight-2016-movie,John Anderson,100,"It’s a masterpiece — an overused word, but not the wrong one. "
2030,django-unchained-movie,Nathan Rabin,91,Tarantino simply isn't a good enough performer for his presence to be anything but a distraction in a rip-roaring crowd-pleaser this consistently great.
2031,pretty-persuasion-movie,Peter Debruge,0,"There's enough estrogen gone awry in this bitchy teen comedy to make ""Mean Girls"" look like a Disney after-school special."
2032,the-tomb-movie,Chris Packham,70,"With its fun script and cheap visuals, Escape Plan evokes the halfwit cheesiness of 1980s-era Cannon films, but it also recalls the deft pacing and legibility of their action sequences."
2033,oh-boy-movie,Mark Zhuravsy,67,"A Coffee in Berlin is watchable and far from dumb, but the film embodies Niko's lack of clarity to the point where it hurts the picture."
2034,the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-the-beginning-movie,Rocco Colella,25,"The new prequel isn't really a slasher movie at all. It's a mess, with too much to say, and an odd genre in which to preach."
2035,no-mans-land-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"A searing, heartbreaking metaphor for the futility of war."
2036,rush-hour-3-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,10,"The biggest loser in all of this is Chan, whose legacy over here won’t be his 20+ years as a martial arts pioneer, but rather his playing straight man to the likes of Tucker and Owen Wilson."
2037,miss-julie-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,10,A strong contender for Worst Picture of All Time.
2038,resident-evil-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,"Mildly grisly, assaultively noisy and tremendously boring."
2039,the-house-of-mirth-movie,Peter Rainer,80,"Terence Davies's The House of Mirth is a rigorously elegant adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel, and unlike in some other Davies movies, the rigor here doesn't turn into rigor mortis.... This is dourness of a degree you won't find in Wharton, but in its own shadowed terms the film is a triumph."
2040,playing-the-field-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"One of those movies that comes ""straight from the heart"" - the heart of the hack screenwriter's manual that pushes formulaic structure to cover up a lack of compelling characters, genuine emotion or actual humor."
2041,the-princess-bride-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"It is filled with good-hearted fun, with performances by actors who seem to be smacking their lips and by a certain true innocence that survives all of Reiner's satire."
2042,hoodwinked-too!-hood-vs-evil-movie,Justin Chang,20,"Less a movie than a ill-advised lab experiment in which classic children's stories are injected with Bond-movie stylings, inane wisecracks and martial-arts mayhem, this manic misfire takes storybook revisionism to ever more irritating ends."
2043,chasing-amy-movie,Sean Means,70,"What Smith does best in Chasing Amy is write clever, raunchy and emotionally true-to-life dialogue."
2044,never-again-movie,Owen Gleiberman,16,"Schaeffer's howler of a romantic comedy, which presents itself as a valentine to Clayburgh even as it keeps dreaming up fresh ways to humiliate her."
2045,zoolander-2-movie,Blake Goble,16,Zoolander No. 2 invokes that old Simpsons headline: “old man yells at modern culture.”
2046,charlie-countryman-movie,Nick McCarthy,38,An egregious entry into the pantheon of films about white Americans traveling to exotic lands in search of identity and soul-searching adventure.
2047,the-pink-panther-movie,Dana Stevens,30,This movie leaves us with the stale whiff of fake nostalgia and something even more odoriferous: the smell of money.
2048,21-grams-movie,Robert Wilonsky,70,"Aimed at the brain, when it should have been one for the heart."
2049,in-the-fade-movie,Deborah Young,80,"Following the fizzle of his coming-of-ager Goodbye Berlin (Tschick) last year, Fatih Akin bounces back and bounces high with an edge-of-seat thriller inspired by xenophobic murders in Germany by a Neo-Nazi group."
2050,marmaduke-movie,Joe Williams,25,"""Beverly Hills Chihuahua,"" we owe you an apology. Among talking-dog movies, Marmaduke is the runt of the litter."
2051,where-in-the-world-is-osama-bin-laden-movie,Michael Ordona,70,"Filmmaker-gadfly Morgan Spurlock is back with the warm, amusing -- and decidedly mistitled -- ""Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?"""
2052,tale-of-tales-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"An English-language film from Italy, Tale of Tales toys with the ogres, princesses and crones of classic fairy tales to almost no dramatic effect, albeit with lots of sex and gore. Imagine the Brothers Grimm’s cousins Tyler and Jake writing for a late-night slot on Cinemax and you’ll get the idea."
2053,the-three-burials-of-melquiades-estrada-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,70,"Jones and Pepper are no Eastwood and Wallach, but the fact that one even thinks to make such a comparison speaks highly of the work here."
2054,teddy-bears-picnic-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,Beyond-lame satire.
2055,last-vegas-movie,Michael Phillips,63,"A genial ""Hangover"" for the AARP set, Last Vegas is roughly what you'd expect, or fear, but a little better."
2056,tarzan-the-ape-man-movie,Staff (Not Credited),12,"TARZAN The Ape Man, in which Bo Derek (the 10 of 10) isJane to newcomer Miles O'Keeffe's mute Tarzan (his chests are bigger thanhers), takes 45 minutes to get to the reasons the film may have attractedan audience. As nearly as I can figure, based on the soft-core porn of theadvertisements, the reasons are three: two belong to Miss Derek, one toO'Keeffe. But although Miss Derek's reasons do receive screen time(O'Keeffe's reason remains unviewed, to the vocal scorn of women in theaudience), this topless Tarzan is not soft-core porn, which might justify,on a utilitarian basis, its existence. It's not that good. [25 July 1981]"
2057,dead-man-on-campus-movie,G. Allen Johnson,25,"Dead Man on Campus, a supposed black comedy produced by MTV, is simply awful."
2058,le-week-end-movie,Dave Calhoun,80,"It’s lightly played, often very funny and shot all over Paris with energy and wit, and boosted by superb, inquiring turns from Broadbent and Duncan."
2059,arabian-nights-volume-1-the-restless-one-movie,Kate Taylor,75,"Labelling his film as a response to the impoverishment of ordinary people caused by the government-imposed austerity of 2013-14, Gomes explains his dilemma brilliantly at the start of Volume 1. How is a well-meaning filmmaker to effectively render the pain of the Portuguese with a documentary set in a town where the shipyard has closed just as alien wasps are attacking local beehives?"
2060,hukkle-movie,J. Hoberman,70,"Deranging a venerable Hungarian tradition of ""village sociology,"" Pálfi employs a bizarrely associative montage to fashion a portrait of a traditional peasant community -- just a midsummer Sunday on Mars."
2061,mystic-river-movie,Todd McCarthy,90,This full-bodied adaptation of Dennis Lehane's involved and involving 2001 bestselling crime novel about old friends in Boston's working-class Irish neighborhood finds Clint Eastwood near the top of his directorial game with a cast of first-rate actors.
2062,leonard-cohen-im-your-man-movie,Stephen Holden,80,"Combines pieces of an extended interview with this Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert organized by Hal Willner at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005."
2063,the-boondock-saints-ii-all-saints-day-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"After nine years, Duffy has coughed up a sequel, and like the first movie it's energetic, proudly juvenile, and reverently derivative."

2065,urban-legends-final-cut-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,12,Just plain bad.
2066,trading-places-movie,Jay Carr,88,"It's easily the best of the movies I've seen by the various ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni, and part of the reason it's funny and satisfying is that it doesn't strain. [09 Jun 1983]"
2067,darling-companion-movie,Roger Ebert,25,It is depressing to reflect on the wealth of talent that conspired to make this inert and listless movie. 
2068,smokin-aces-movie,David Edelstein,10,Again and again the killers linger sadistically over the dead or dying bodies of the people they've dispatched. Did Carnahan think these sickening scenes would give Smokin' Aces a moral complexity that's generally absent from this genre? I think they make the picture seem even more morally bankrupt.
2069,the-beat-that-my-heart-skipped-movie,Michael Sragow,100,"Brilliant, brutally poignant."
2070,father-figures-movie,Eve Barlow,20,"Limp jokes, bad chemistry and the least believable onscreen fraternal bond make for a very lacklustre viewing experience. Even a late appearance from Christopher Walken can't save the day."
2071,the-mortal-instruments-city-of-bones-movie,Bilge Ebiri,30,"City of Bones isn’t the worst of its kind, but crap served with flair is still basically crap."
2072,bushwick-movie,Robert Abele,30,"Realistically depicting full-scale domestic terrorism is one thing, but directors Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott seem unaware of how their long-take gimmick — the cuts are easily determined — destroys logic, emboldens the use of stereotypes, and kills suspense."
2073,despicable-me-3-movie,Mike Scott,20,There's little refreshing or charming about it.
2074,assault-on-precinct-13-movie,Jami Bernard,63,"In a preamble that sets up Hawke's character, the jittery hand-held camera and grainy palette establish the look and feel of a '70s movie, thus paying homage to the Carpenter version, which, frankly, had more suspense."
2075,an-honest-liar-movie,Joe Morgenstern,70,"The film deserves to be seen, and admired, for its own revelations, and for its unlikely, yet deeply affecting, transformation into a story of abiding love that, in its own turn, involves a deception. At the age of 86, Mr. Randi is a small, gnomish figure who walks with a cane. What seems entirely undiminished, though, is the power of his mind, driven more than ever by the dictates of his heart."
2076,after-dark-my-sweet-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,Director-cowriter James Foley has given this near-perfect adaptation of a Jim Thompson novel a contempo setting and emotional realism that make it as potent as a snakebite.
2077,the-pink-panther-movie,M. E. Russell,16,It's pathetic.
2078,the-painted-veil-movie,Marrit Ingman,89,Acted with such venomous restraint that it hurts to watch.
2079,popstar-never-stop-never-stopping-movie,Nick de Semlyen,80,"An absolute blast, with a frenetic strike-rate and songs that will worm their way into your ears for days. Like Conner, this comedy’s for real."
2080,the-snowman-movie,David Edelstein,10,I figured the film would have an off-the-charts creepy quotient (the novel is chilling) and gobs of atmosphere. I could never have predicted it would turn out to be such a shambles.
2081,the-princess-diaries-movie,Lisa Alspector,30,Trite transformation comedy.
2082,delirious-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"This is the best DiCillo movie I've seen, and he's made some good ones (""Box of Moonlight,"" ""The Real Blonde"")."
2083,cellular-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"By occupying their roles believably, by acting as we think their characters probably would, they save the movie from feeling like basic Hollywood action (even when it probably is). This is one of the year's best thrillers."
2084,lornas-silence-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,Echoes long after the movie ends.
2085,el-ardor-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Ardor, in the end, has little ardor, or originality or magic about it. It’s just a mundane C-movie action picture that tries to pass itself off as something deeper."
2086,standing-tall-movie,Eli Hayes,83,"Bercot is able to craft a believable arc within her protagonist, allowing for a gradual character progression rather than one that is abrupt and difficult to reckon with."
2087,year-one-movie,J.R. Jones,20,Creatively it's a giant step backwards.
2088,the-presidio-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"The whole movie has the feeling of a clone, of a film assembled out of spare parts from other movies, out at the cinematic junkyard."
2089,the-disaster-artist-movie,Leah Greenblatt,83,"It feels only appropriate that James Franco, an actor and director for whom weirdness is next to godliness, would be the one to tell his story."
2090,the-bfg-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"Contrasting The BFG to ""E.T."" does the new film a disservice, and it’s mediocre enough that it doesn’t need the comparison to emphasize its shortcomings. In recent years, Spielberg has become a hit-and-miss filmmaker and this is closer to a “miss” than a “hit.”"
2091,a-hijacking-movie,Neil Young,80,[A Hijacking] illuminatingly and sensitively dramatizes an easily-overlooked global crime phenomenon. 
2092,fatal-attraction-movie,Angie Errigo,80,Two absolutely riveting performances and a smart reversal of the usual male-female stalker scenario leave behind a nasty taste and an unforgettable cinema experience.
2093,i-am-sam-movie,Connie Ogle,38,"There's only one excuse for the sentimental and ham-handed I Am Sam, and it's not to tout the rights of the mentally disabled."
2094,roman-de-gare-movie,V.A. Musetto,75,"Roman de Gare translates as ""station novel,"" a book you might pick up to read on a train journey and then discard when you arrive at your destination. Lelouch's film is the cinematic equivalent, enjoyable fluff that your mind will discard after the closing credits - but worth seeing nevertheless."
2095,scoop-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,"This gives nobody, least of all me, any pleasure, but a truth must be faced: Scoop is the worst movie Woody Allen has ever made."
2096,basquiat-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"The New York art world quickly makes Basquiat a star. His work is good (when you see it in the movie, you can feel why people liked it so much), but his story is better: from a cardboard box to a gallery opening!"
2097,2016-obamas-america-movie,Richard Corliss,30,"Many of D’Souza’s charges in his movie are either piffling (Obama returned a bust of Winston Churchill to the British Embassy), wrong (the U.S. is drilling for at least as much oil now as in the George W. Bush) or murky."
2098,the-year-my-parents-went-on-vacation-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"What makes this film appealingly honest are its details, not its grand events."
2099,trespass-against-us-movie,Godfrey Cheshire,12,"Though many bad movies are simply depressing, Adam Smith’s Trespass Against Us is so exceptionally bad that it at least has this bright sidelight: Unless 2017 turns into a truly disastrous time for movies, it may be the worst of the year is already here."
2100,be-kind-rewind-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"At its best when it is at its most freewheeling -- when it tramples past logic, motivation and basic plausibility in its pursuit of a funny, whimsical kind of nonsense."
2101,the-face-of-an-angel-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,20,"Rambling, frustrating and wholly uninvolving, The Face of an Angel (based on Barbie Latza Nadeau’s nonfiction account of the murder) swarms with ideas that have no place to land. "
2102,the-mill-and-the-cross-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Here is a film of great beauty and attention, and watching it is a form of meditation. Sometimes films take a great stride outside the narrow space of narrative tradition and present us with things to think about. Here mostly what I thought was, why must man sometimes be so cruel? "
2103,last-holiday-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,30,"If you really want to live life to the fullest, step one is to avoid wasting an hour and a half of your life in a theater showing Last Holiday."
2104,the-girl-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"Has the dreary one-track banality of a feature-length version of an episode of ""Red Shoe Diaries,"" Showtime's series for people who like soft core but are too lazy to leave the house."
2105,twisted-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"It's an old maxim that you can't make a good movie from a bad script. But with the suspense thriller Twisted, Philip Kaufman shows that you can make one that looks like it should be good."
2106,girl-on-a-bicycle-movie,Sam Weisberg,30,"Girl on a Bicycle is like Micki + Maude minus the outrage, complexity, or crack timing."
2107,light-sleeper-movie,Staff (Not Credited),75,"Paul Schrader's study of a middle-aged drug dealer, is a return to the director's thematic roots, an exploration of the dark side of the American psyche. "

2109,the-square-movie,Michael Ordona,70,"As one might expect from stuntman-turned-director Nash Edgerton, the action is well staged."
2110,the-lovely-bones-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"As someone new to the material, I found Jackson’s film soulful, respectful, masterful, horrifying, rending and emotionally true.  It may not be the Lovely Bones that you have in mind, but it’s a fine and powerful one."
2111,nymphomaniac-volume-i-movie,Kate Stables,80,"With explicit sex and penetrating philosophy, this erotic odyssey requires close attention and an open mind."
2112,west-of-memphis-movie,Ty Burr,88,"While the “Paradise Lost” films captured events as they unfolded in the heat of battle, West of Memphis has the luxury of at least partial closure."
2113,valhalla-rising-movie,Rex Reed,25,"Valhalla Rising is nothing more than an updated version of the kind of time-honored Hollywood Viking  movie Kirk Douglas used to do in his sleep, which means lots of inhuman, bone-crunching violence and no plot."
2114,the-square-2017-movie,Andrew Crump,86,"The Square’s contrast between categories of morality is peak Östlund. There’s no clearly defined gauge for goodness or badness here, just a palette of gray ethical relativism to offset the film’s superior construction."
2115,faceoff-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"It's the picture that proves action films don't have to be silly, that a few thrill sequences don't mean every other value has to be shot to pieces."
2116,paranoid-park-movie,Todd McCarthy,90,"Through immaculate use of picture, sound and time, the director adds another panel to his series of pictures about disaffected, disconnected youth."

2121,synecdoche-new-york-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"The film disappoints terribly, too. The directorial debut of such an imaginative and clever screenwriter was a highly anticipated event. His ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" are two of the most innovative and intriguing movies of the past decade. Synecdoche is one of the most maddening."

2127,jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-movie,Alex Welch,70,"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle brings audiences back to its classic fictional world with a fun, updated new twist on its well-worn story. So even if some of its subplots and emotional throughlines don’t quite click, the action-packed fun and humor should still make it worth your price of admission."
2128,man-on-the-train-movie,Peter Rainer,70,"As in many a French movie, especially crime movie, the philosophe and the crook turn out to be each other’s mirror image."
2129,memories-of-tomorrow-movie,Ella Taylor,70,"This heartfelt tale of disintegration and acceptance, seasoned with family devotion, will both raise and soothe the anxieties of those of us who regularly ask ourselves why we came into the kitchen two minutes ago."
2130,best-night-ever-movie,Frank Scheck,10,This witless found-footage comedy — doesn’t so much satirize its chosen genre as shamelessly rip it off.
2131,dust-to-glory-movie,Scott Foundas,100,"Absolutely exhilarating...Pound for pound, it's more kinetically thrilling than anything Hollywood has produced in years, not least of all because it's real."
2132,father-figures-movie,Katie Walsh,0,"Father Figures is a movie, ostensibly. I'm pretty sure it is. Moving images were projected, along with recorded sound, which indicates it is a movie, but the effect was so listless, low-energy and profoundly unentertaining that I jotted down in my notes ""what even IS this?"" It would be more accurate to describe the experience as a nearly two-hour borderline hostage situation, with torture involving bad, offensive and unfunny ""comedy."""
2133,singin-in-the-rain-movie,William Thomas,100,"With so many films dedicated to the agonies of filmmaking, Singin’ overflows with the pleasure of movie creation, stitching together references to Hollywood history with more alacrity than Tarantino. One of the highpoints of hoofin’ history but, more importantly, an unadulterated joy."
2134,marci-x-movie,Scott Foundas,10,"It's tough to decide just what's more offensive: the movie's musty depiction of gangsta rap as public enemy No. 1, the notion that all an uptight white girl needs to loosen up is a few puffs on a Philly blunt, or the idea that any of this might be remotely funny."
2135,get-over-it-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,A lame teen comedy.
2136,reprise-movie,John Anderson,80,"Reprise says many cogent things about success, what it does to people and how they define it. But it also indicts the mechanics of the culture in a way that is neither Danish nor American but globalized and all the more poignant for it."
2137,dheepan-movie,Robert Abele,90,"Though Dheepan is another triumph for Audiard, it could have just as easily not worked had its leads not been so affecting"
2138,true-crime-movie,Peter Travers,63,"At first it's a kick to watch Clint Eastwood play Steve Everett, a horn-dog newsman...Is Clint being Clinton-esque? Even if he's not, these scenes are the liveliest part of this dog-tired movie."
2139,licence-to-kill-movie,Peter Travers,38,"Drab in the extreme. Timothy Dalton's second and wheezing, final turn as 007 was barely recognizable as a Bond film."
2140,dumb-and-dumber-to-movie,Drew Taylor,0,"The original film was unpredictable and loose and every so often gave up the aura of dangerousness. If anything, the sequel is a tepid, watered down, and at 100-minutes oftentimes boring attempt to recapture the magic but without any of the whimsy."
2141,exists-movie,Frank Scheck,0,"Bereft of interesting characters, clever dialogue and any semblance of humor or visual coherence, Exists offers nothing to justify its cinematic existence."

2143,the-september-issue-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,As for getting close to Wintour -- or even explaining the unfathomable mystery that can be haute couture -- the film comes up empty.
2144,all-is-lost-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"The presence of Robert Redford gives the character weight, if not depth, because we bring to the film everything we know about the actor from other movies. Redford’s characters have seemed unflappable for more than 40 years: sometimes cool, sometimes cocky, but almost always master of a situation. To see him beginning to flounder is to see a new Redford, one who catches us off guard."

2148,irreversible-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Truthfully, it's all incredibly boring. Noé tosses in some dime-store existentialism (""Time destroys everything""), but this is a movie with not a whole lot on its mind except rank exploitation."
2149,young-frankenstein-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,"Brooks's most accomplished work, combining his well-known brand of comedy with stylish direction and a uniformly excellent cast."
2150,life-2017-movie,Amy Nicholson,67,"Like life itself, the film is unemotional and cruel. It hides its own nihilism behind grotesqueries that force the audience's stomachs to clench. We can't help feeling things. After all, we, too, are just collections of cells, and Espinosa plays our nervous system like a flamenco guitar in concert with head-pounding drums and nauseous trombones."
2151,beautiful-boy-movie,Nathan Rabin,91,"Like its fellow crowd-depressor ""Blue Valentine,"" Beautiful Boy offers the antithesis of escapism: a claustrophobic, punishingly intense, beautifully measured exploration of the depths of human despair."

2155,the-robber-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Exhilarating and, ultimately, filled with a sense of existential dread."

2159,the-hunting-party-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"What makes The Hunting Party an original, gonzo treat is the way that Shepard plants the movie's tone somewhere between hair-trigger investigative danger and the from-the-frying-pan-into-the-fire glee of a Hope/Crosby picture."
2160,disobedience-movie,Allison Shoemaker,83,"The performances, like the film, are rich, layered things of tremendous feeling and complexity. The characters, like the film, are imperfect but well worthy of cherishing. "
2161,grindhouse-movie,Lawrence Toppman,63,Cool. Stupid. Juiced-up. Feeble. Stripped-down. Self-indulgent. Clever. Sophomoric.
2162,gigli-movie,Ty Burr,0,"An overlong, joyless, and inconsequential affair, full of dead air, and possessing only a few moments of jaw-dropping bad taste. It's a dull disaster."
2163,la-jalousie-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,90,"Vital and vigorous even when its characters feel scraped of vigor/vitality, Philippe Garrel's latest finds boho Parisians facing the ends of marriages, affairs, and the feasibility of bohemian existence itself."
2164,first-blood-movie,Bill Cosford,25,"First Blood is no more than a man-bites-town retread, in which Vietnam and its aftermath are merely the angle. [27 Oct 1982, p.B6]"
2165,left-behind-2014-movie,William Goss,0,"Religious dramas have a track record of prioritizing wholesome values at the cost of production values, and while Left Behind is mostly too preoccupied with being a hoary thriller to preach to the converted, it’s a thoroughly laughable attempt to marry bombast with sermonizing. "
2166,norman-the-moderate-rise-and-tragic-fall-of-a-new-york-fixer-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"Even with Gere’s standout work, a little of Norman goes a long way, and this film offers up a lot of Norman. "
2167,captain-phillips-movie,Lou Lumenick,100,"It falls to Hanks and his movie-star presence to anchor this ambitious enterprise, and he does some of his most impressive acting without saying a word."
2168,an-innocent-man-movie,Michael Wilmington,30,"This cautionary thriller about an unjustly imprisoned airline mechanic has a chance to be a canny blend of gutsy melodrama and J'Accuse against the prison system. But, by the end, it has gone as slick and corrupt as the crafty old con (F. Murray Abraham) who advises Tom Selleck's framed Jimmie Rainwood on jail survival. On a fundamental moral level, An Innocent Man is guilty as hell."
2169,frankie-and-alice-movie,Nathan Rabin,30,"Frankie & Alice gives her the rare opportunity to play a film’s hero and its villain inside the same body, and she does a memorably dreadful job in both capacities. That trainwreck fascination is about the only redeeming facet of a prestige picture gone terribly, though not entertainingly, awry."
2170,lethal-weapon-3-movie,Hillel Italie,0,"Lethal Weapon 3 offends on all levels. With its empty-headed direction and lazy acting, the film deserves to be ignored. [14 May 1992]"

2175,steal-this-movie-movie,Charles Taylor,10,"The disgrace of Steal This Movie isn't just that it fails to do justice to its subject, but that, as a movie, it's barely competent."
2176,flags-of-our-fathers-movie,David Denby,80,"Flags of Our Fathers is an accomplished, stirring, but, all in all, rather strange movie"
2177,the-oath-movie,David Denby,70,"Who are these men, so eager for asceticism, violence, and martyrdom? At first, we think that’s what we’ll learn from The Oath, a fascinating documentary directed, produced, and shot by Laura Poitras. We don’t really, but what we do find out is of equal interest, and oddly reassuring."
2178,chasing-amy-movie,G. Allen Johnson,38,"The intention is there, but the needed emotional maturity isn't."
2179,crazy-horse-movie,Walter Addiego,75,"If nothing else, you'll surely relish the extravagant rhetoric used by Ali Mahdavi, the club's artistic director, to describe what is basically a tasteful nudie revue."
2180,hitchcocktruffaut-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Smart, thoughtful and elegantly done, Hitchcock/Truffaut is more than an authoritative look at the careers and interpersonal dynamics of directors Alfred Hitchcock and Francois Truffaut, a pair of unlikely soul mates; it's also, as director Kent Jones intended, a love letter to film itself, to the value and lure of the cinematic experience."
2181,the-godfather-movie,James Berardinelli,100,"The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion... It was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual."
2182,getaway-movie,Kyle Smith,12,Getaway is so bad that what’s most surprising about it is that Nicolas Cage didn’t manage to star in it. But one man can only do so many low-rent projects a year.
2183,road-trip-movie,J. Rentilly,5,"A cinematic lowpoint, even within its decidedly lowbrow genre, the teen gross-out sex romp."
2184,the-honeymooners-movie,Peter Debruge,38,"What's missing is some faith in the audience's intelligence and, more importantly, the jokes."
2185,30-beats-movie,Frank Scheck,20,"Clearly aiming for high artistic ground, the film doesn't even satisfy on an arousal level, with the discreet nudity and endless yakking not exactly proving a turn-on.  "
2186,suicide-squad-movie,Chris Nashawaty,67,"Writer-director David Ayer (End of Watch) skillfully sets up the film, introducing each of the crazies with caffeinated comic-book energy. But their mission...is a bit of a bust. The stakes should feel higher."
2187,8-women-2000-movie,Andy Klein,0,"Inert, unfunny, and not even interesting as a dirty movie, 8 1/2 Women could well rank as one of the worst films of the year."

2189,dunkirk-movie,Manohla Dargis,100,"Dunkirk is a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday’s fights and today’s. "
2190,night-on-earth-movie,Peter Travers,100,"Jarmusch is a true visionary; he knows his films can't bring order to the ravishing chaos around him, but he can't resist the fun of trying. In this compassionate comedy of missed connections, he makes us see the ordinary in fresh and pertinent ways. But the flickers of humanity in those taxis are soon dulled by barriers of time, sex, race, language and money. They are flickers in a vast emotional void."
2191,all-good-things-movie,Ann Hornaday,63,"All Good Things is creepy and weird and sad, and little else."
2192,hollow-man-movie,Tom Keogh,10,We don't even have Joe Eszterhas to blame for this one.
2193,the-shape-of-water-movie,Mike Scott,100,"A wonderfully weird love story that plays like an adult fairy tale, it's a fantastical delight -- and the kind of movie that deserves all the accolades it will most certainly receive this award season."
2194,42-movie,Rick Groen,63,"In the hallowed frames of 42, the legend is front and centre and still inspiring. Too bad the more interesting man is nowhere to be seen."
2195,half-past-dead-movie,Sean Axmaker,25,"Call this one ""Die Hard"" on Alcatraz, and this time the ""cuckoo crazy"" maverick has got the homeboys on his side."

2197,grace-jones-bloodlight-and-bami-movie,Roger Moore,75,"Bloodlight and Bami may be mostly for her most faithful fans, but it makes for an interesting, just-revealing-enough portrait for those who only know her from the image she’s created and the music that rarely made it out of the clubs, back in the day."
2198,the-constant-gardener-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"A film that grips us dramatically, intellectually and emotionally."
2199,dolphin-tale-2-movie,Marc Mohan,83,"The actual video footage of some of the incidents recreated in the film, which play with the end credits, makes it clear that sometimes reality can be as hokey as fiction. "
2200,music-within-movie,Jessica Reaves,63,Starts strong but eventually collapses under its weighty sense of responsibility.
2201,little-boy-movie,Rex Reed,75,"There is a lot to admire here. Writer-director Alejandro Monteverde (Bella) is not afraid to take his time letting you get to know the characters or moving things along, but the movie never seems ponderous."
2202,the-best-of-me-movie,Michael Ordona,25,"The film is an improvement on previous Sparks moody-doomed-love opuses such as “The Last Song” and “Dear John.” If that is damning with faint praise, the cogs here are the same as in his previous love machines"
2203,the-incredible-burt-wonderstone-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Steve Carell is fatally miscast as an arrogant, flamboyant third-rate magician in The Incredible Burt Wonderstone, which by all rights should have been a second-rate Will Ferrell vehicle."
2204,the-black-dahlia-movie,Ethan Alter,63,"You've got to give the guy (De Palma) some credit. He's made a bizarre, baffling and at times flat-out bad movie. But at least it's rarely boring."
2205,71-movie,Mike D'Angelo,83,"The setting may be Belfast ’71, but Demange’s sensibility — first-rate suspense coupled with black-and-white politics — is much more James Cameron ’86."
2206,resident-evil-apocalypse-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"Like so many movies with a keypad for a brain, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is another exercise in making us feel the irritation associated with having to stand behind some game hack for our turn to play."
2207,annapolis-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"It is the anti-Sundance film, an exhausted wheeze of bankrupt cliches and cardboard characters, the kind of film that has no visible reason for existing, except that everybody got paid."
2208,joe-dirt-movie,Athima Chansanchai,12,"Even with help from a pathetic Kid Rock and a boost from always-on Christopher Walken, Spade can't pull this off."
2209,the-karate-kid-movie,Michael Phillips,63,"Jackie Chan co-stars in Morita's old role of the humble maintenance man who coaches the Bullied One. The older Chan gets, the simpler and truer he becomes as a performer."
2210,jason-x-movie,Steve Davis,0,"It had a little originality, unlike the other sequels, but not much."
2211,metropolitan-movie,Jaime N. Christley,88,"Metropolitan celebrates and mourns the specific character of a place and time, youthful associations and crushes, a toolkit of values, even if those values are not exactly shared by, say, housewives in Duluth and auto mechanics in Albuquerque. "
2212,tell-no-one-movie,Ella Taylor,80,"Among the movie's many delights are the fluctuating rhythms of its pacing, an atmospheric volatility that sets off the doctor's blooming paranoia against his sunlit, leafy surroundings, and a terrific cast that includes Kristin Scott Thomas."
2213,a-cure-for-wellness-movie,Rex Reed,0,"A long, incoherent German horror film called A Cure for Wellness is well on its way to late-night cable TV. If you’re a dedicated masochist looking for torture, look for it fast. It won’t live to see a re-release."
2214,i-vitelloni-re-release-movie,J. Hoberman,70,"Moving from cafés to poolrooms to movie theaters, it's the prototypical male ensemble film."
2215,the-smurfs-2-movie,Phil Brown,25,Only adults with 'Smurf-holm syndrome' could love this film. 
2216,yadon-ilaheyya-movie,Sean Axmaker,91,"The Divine Intervention of the title lies somewhere between hope and fantasy. In a world in which Santa Claus is assaulted in Nazareth, what do you have left?"
2217,the-greatest-showman-movie,Leah Greenblatt,75,"The movie never quite stops feeling like Moulin Rouge! written in extra-large block font, or Broadway projected straight onto a big screen, which certainly isn’t bad news if that’s exactly what you love."
2218,thirteen-movie,Duane Byrge,70,"An engaging, sympathetic portrait of junior high girls who have grown up too fast and way too little. Without being preachy, it's also a cogent, terrifying tale of the lack of supervision many teens face and the utter inability of many parents to not only raise kids but also to direct their own lives. "
2219,rock-the-kasbah-movie,Kate Erbland,25,"Although no one comes off looking especially good, an acceptable alternate title for the film could be ""The Ugly Americans,"" because Mitch Glazer's script takes some of the worst stereotypes about ex-pats and blows them sky high."
2220,just-married-movie,Desson Thomson,10,Don't even consider this when it hits the Blockbuster shelves of shame.
2221,black-mass-movie,Lee Marshall,80,Johnny Depp’s broodingly psychotic turn as convicted Boston crime lord James ‘Whitey’ Bulger is not the only tasty thing about Scott Cooper’s tale of the unholy alliance between a South Boston Irish mobster and the FBI.
2222,one-shot-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Jack Reacher, which Christopher McQuarrie directed from his adaptation of a Lee Child crime novel, is not just another dumb thriller. It's almost peerlessly self-important, weirdly incoherent and eerily smarmy. It's also mysteriously inept, considering that Tom Cruise plays the title role."
2223,chloe-movie,Liam Lacey,75,"Chloe is director Atom Egoyan’s foray into the realm of what might be called artful trash. This is a high-toned erotic thriller, handled with style and some emotionally raw scenes, aiming for an effect that’s pleasingly unnerving, if not outright arousing."
2224,swing-vote-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,Brain-dead political satire/tear-jerker.
2225,jfk-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Stone and his editors, Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia, have somehow triumphed over the tumult of material here and made it work - made it grip and disturb us."
2226,while-you-were-sleeping-movie,Richard Schickel,90,What is startling is how well While You Were Sleeping recaptures the true spirit of the best kind of modern fairy tale -- classic romantic comedy.
2227,night-shift-movie,Gary Arnold,90,"The largest shares of credit for this pleasant surprise evidently belong to director Ron Howard--whose assurance behind the camera may come as a revelation to people still associating him with the roles of little Opie on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and clean-cut Richie on ""Happy Days""."
2228,cirque-du-freak-the-vampires-assistant-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Calls to mind Grandpa taking out his dentures and trying to put on a comedy monster show for little kids at Halloween: When he tries to be scary, he's goofy, but when he tries to be goofy, he's scary."
2229,anatomy-of-hell-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,10,The dialogue that is wrapped around the sexual activities only helps to make the film disgustingly ridiculous.
2230,loving-movie,Sarah Kurchak,91,"Instead of simple heroes or avatars for big ideas about equality, Loving delivers complex, imperfect human beings who are struggling to find their place in a far from perfect world. "
2231,a-very-long-engagement-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"It's a magical film which manages to transport and rivet us in the same highly-imaginitive, breezily playful way ""Amelie"" did."
2232,elsa-fred-movie,Jon Frosch,30,"Despite the presence of Shirley MacLaine and Christopher Plummer, both sprightly and appealing in the lead roles, this misfire of a cornball romance is so tone-deaf, so utterly lacking in screwball snap and visual punch, that viewers will find it hard to care whether or not the aging lovebirds end up in each other’s arms."
2233,the-trumpet-of-the-swan-movie,Paul Malcolm,30,"At times, both swans and humans appear oddly out of sync with their flat backgrounds, while the film's few musical flights of fancy never achieve visual liftoff."
2234,transformers-age-of-extinction-movie,Scott Bowles,38,"Deafening, deadening and about two hours too long, Extinction would mark the weakest installment yet of the 7-year-old Hasbro franchise — if the previous three movies were discernible from one another."
2235,dark-blue-movie,Steven Rea,12,"The movie heads in a disastrous direction: namely, a police academy ceremony... This lets-wrap-this-thing-up moment sucks the life and the honesty out of an otherwise compelling portrait of tainted lawmen, tainted law."
2236,twisted-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,30,"Combining the ludicrous with the lurid, Twisted is twisted all right. "
2237,the-lady-and-the-duke-movie,Frank Lovece,80,"The effect is one of gorgeous puppets, a removed perspective that makes some of the most powerful political and social events in history seem like the sad, desperate flailing of monkeys."
2238,the-ballad-of-jack-and-rose-movie,Keith Phipps,30,"Some good Bob Dylan songs are called in to underline the big moments, but end up eclipsing them instead. There's more drama and insight in a snippet of ""One More Cup Of Coffee"" than the entirety of Jack & Rose."
2239,the-theory-of-everything-movie,Kevin Harley,80,"A lovingly balanced biopic that fends off award-gobbling clichés. Smarts + heart = a winner: it’s a simple equation, but Marsh makes it add up. "
2240,blind-2017-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,38,One doesn’t need perfect vision to quickly surmise that this sudsy affair among Manhattan swells is a glorified Hallmark Channel melodrama.
2241,life-or-something-like-it-movie,Jonathan Foreman,38,"Partly a schmaltzy, by-the-numbers romantic comedy, partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless."
2242,the-hobbit-there-and-back-again-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"Now, thanks to this last film, in 3-D, the pleasure is intense, and mixed with awe. There is majesty here, and not just because we’re in the presence of magnificently regal madness."
2243,intolerable-cruelty-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Takes the traditional romantic comedy and tweaks it by way of ""The War of the Roses."" Rarely has strife between the sexes been so ruthless, so civilized, and so funny. "
2244,the-devil-wears-prada-movie,Helen O'Hara,80,"This smart and funny creation is not just wish-fulfilment for the ""Sex And The City"" generation -- it's a Wall Street for the 21st century."
2245,boxing-helena-movie,Rick Groen,0,"The whole mess turns nuttier by the second. A black comedy, you ask? I wish. There are plenty of laughs here, but nary a one is intentional."
2246,my-favorite-martian-movie,Michael Wilmington,12,"There are good movies, bad movies and confoundingly bad movies. My Favorite Martian belongs to that rare third category. [12 Feb 1999, p.A]"
2247,panic-movie,Kevin Maynard,100,"Unfolds like quietly engrossing short fiction, reminding us that there are few things more pleasurable than being in the hands of a good storyteller."
2248,incendies-movie,Andrea Gronvall,80,"By the end theyve acquired a measure of self-knowledge at a cost dearer than they expected, which reminds us that what we think we know can be just the beginning of an existential journey."
2249,australia-movie,Jenni Miller,38,"A self-impressed epic with grandiose vistas, flat characters, and a subplot about Native Australians."
2250,toys-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"The film is a jokey, nattering fiasco, as awful as Hudson Hawk. And yet, like that famous disaster, it never loses its aura of precocious self-satisfaction. "
2251,the-florida-project-movie,Ed Gonzalez,88,"Sean Baker spends much of The Florida Project charging in vigorously nimble fashion up and down the stairs of the Magic Castle, in and out of its rooms, investing the minutia of the down-and-out lives within this little ecosystem with a bittersweet energy and significance. "
2252,silver-city-movie,Connie Ogle,63,"Huston, unfortunately, is never really believable as a man rediscovering lost principles; he feels out of place in this otherwise fine ensemble."
2253,the-untamed-movie,Martyn Conterio,80,Escalante is a master filmmaker when it comes to creating atmosphere.
2254,final-destination-3-movie,Wesley Morris,75,"Week in and week out, horror movies cheat us, so it's wonderfully cathartic to watch a bunch of kids cheat death in what turns out to be the best installment yet in the ""Final Destination"" franchise."
2255,nebraska-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"I’ve always admired this director’s commitment to both seriousness and laughter, to showing the beauty and significance of ordinary human life side by side with its petty, venal absurdity."
2256,thanks-for-sharing-movie,Ty Burr,63,See Steve McQueen’s “Shame” (2011) if you want a sense of how destructive this sickness can be to the soul. See Thanks for Sharing if you want to know what people can do about it.
2257,crown-heights-movie,Emily Yoshida,70,We’re left floored by the facts of Colin Warner’s case; the film itself falls away.
2258,sin-city-a-dame-to-kill-for-movie,Alonso Duralde,10,"For a film loaded with decapitations and gun-toting ladies in bondage gear, Sin City gets really tedious really quickly."
2259,schindlers-list-movie,Terrence Rafferty,100,"Few American movies since the silent era have had anything approaching this picture's narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness. [20 Dec 1993, p.129]"
2260,sideways-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,"Sideways makes you glad about America, about movies, about life."
2261,taken-3-movie,Peter Bradshaw,20,"It’s difficult to know what subtitle to give this. Taken 3: Not Again, or Taken 3: Seriously? or Taken 3: This Is Getting a Bit Much Frankly."
2262,reel-paradise-movie,Scott Foundas,70,"There's something magical about seeing a packed house of 300 Taveuni locals laugh equally uproariously, and, without a nanosecond’s worth of culture shock, at Queen Latifah in ""Bringing Down the House"" and Buster Keaton in ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."""
2263,hoodwinked-too!-hood-vs-evil-movie,Michelle Orange,0,"One of the more depressing, desensitizing experiences I've had in a theater, Hoodwinked Too! Hood Vs. Evil feels as computer-generated as its creepy, talking-ceramic-toy style of animation. "
2264,senna-movie,Nick Pinkerton,80,"The aura of a life lived in extremis, undergirded by faith, clings to the film. Even nonbelievers in Senna's sport and church will find it difficult to visit Kapadia's cinematic shrine without emotion."
2265,bad-company-2001-movie,J. Hoberman,70,"A considerably more unsettling tale of one-sided amour fou, reportedly inspired by an actual case of teenage prostitution, Jean-Pierre Améris's Bad Company puts the coy prurience of American high school films in brutal perspective."
2266,the-choice-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,10,"Directed by Ross Katz and filmed like an ad for erectile-dysfunction medication, The Choice is almost repellently synthetic."
2267,harlem-nights-movie,Michael Wilmington,10,"The movie is full of phallic gags about little-bitty guns and crude jokes at physical or emotional infirmities. [17 Nov 1989, p.6]"
2268,monster-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,80,"An okay movie made nearly great by one great thing: the bravura, mercilessly watchable performance of Charlize Theron."
2269,wilson-movie,Kenji Fujishima,38,"Wilson lurches jarringly from poignant melancholy to cartoonish slapstick, unable to settle on a consistent tone."
2270,the-trip-to-spain-movie,Moira Macdonald,75,"The “Trip” movies, like the anchovies Coogan and Brydon happily devour, aren’t to everyone’s taste.... But oh, those impressions."
2271,millers-crossing-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,0,"A lifeless, tedious picture... A complete dud.  [29 Oct 1990, p.26]"
2272,erased-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,30,"Viewed solely as a string of action sequences, Erased delivers the kind of dryly efficient, wearyingly familiar entertainment that already clogs too many of our movie screens."
2273,wreck-it-ralph-movie,Michael Phillips,63,"I found the first 30 minutes of Wreck-It Ralph a lot of fun, the second and third 30 minutes progressively more routine."
2274,breaking-the-waves-movie,Elvis Mitchell,90,"A narrative path leading from the sincere to the ludicrous, and culminating in a final image of flabbergasting transcendance, gives Breaking the Waves its surprising power."
2275,midnight-special-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"Midnight Special announces the arrival of a filmmaker in total control of his technique as well as our emotions. A bravura science-fiction thriller that explores emotional areas like parenthood and the nature of belief, it's a riveting genre exercise as well as something more."
2276,christine-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"She's such a fascinating, faceted character that halfway through ""Christine"" you almost forget about what's coming."
2277,unfinished-business-movie,Jon Frosch,30,"Unfinished Business is the cinematic equivalent of sub-par fast food (think Carl’s Jr. or Jack in the Box); it’s cheap, easy and maybe even tasty for a second or two, but leaves you feeling queasy and undernourished. "
2278,hotel-rwanda-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"This role could represent a career performance for Cheadle, whose forceful and multi-dimensional portrayal keeps Hotel Rwanda at a consistently high level."
2279,bowling-for-columbine-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,"Moore's concern about issues is genuine, and his showboating technique is often entertaining. But he is not the most organized person in the world, and there is a scattershot randomness about this film that is both its essence and a source of frustration."
2280,kids-movie,Todd McCarthy,90,"Disturbing because it is so believable, Kids goes well beyond any previous American film in frankly describing the lives of at least a certain group of modern teenagers."
2281,pixels-movie,Chris Nashawaty,33,"Neither Sandler nor his listless writers (too many punchlines just sit there and collect flies) seem invested. Whether he’s saving the planet or putting the moves on Michelle Monaghan, Sandler can’t be bothered to raise his pulse above comatose. If he doesn’t care, why should anyone else?"
2282,life-itself-movie,Joe Neumaier,100,"The irony is that Ebert famously lost his actual voice. Yet as the extraordinary documentary Life Itself shows, that couldn’t quiet one of America’s most beloved critics and cultural commentators."
2283,cocktail-movie,Sheila Benson,10,"Arm wrestling and hamburger building have been exhausted as backgrounds for movies, so it was probably inevitable that bartending would be next. But nothing quite prepares you for the hamburger that Cocktail makes of an old and relatively honorable profession. [29 Jul 1988, p.14]"
2284,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,Roger Ebert,12,Awful in so many different ways.
2285,about-cherry-movie,David Fear,20,"Given that porn star and academic Lorelei Lee cowrote the script, we can assume that the film's portrayal of the cine-erotica industry is accurate. Which simply means that, while totally botching little things like how people speak, act and live in the real world, the film gets at least one thing right."
2286,battle-royale-2000-movie,A.O. Scott,90,"American fans of ""The Hunger Games"" may not embrace - or even be permitted to see - Battle Royale, which is too bad. It is in many ways a better movie and in any case a fascinating companion, drawn from a parallel cultural universe. It is a lot uglier and also, perversely, a lot more fun. "
2287,frostnixon-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Director Ron Howard has turned Peter Morgan's stage success into a grabber of a movie laced with tension, stinging wit and potent human drama."
2288,aquamarine-movie,Kyle Smith,63,"It's high-spirited, innocent fun."
2289,frankenweenie-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"While Frankenweenie is fun, it is not nearly strange or original enough to join the undead, monstrous ranks of the classics it adores. "
2290,the-guest-movie,Dennis Harvey,80,The Guest is blood-soaked action trash of a high grade.
2291,open-range-movie,William Arnold,91,"It's a gorgeously atmospheric, perfectly cast, beautifully crafted oater of the old school, made with heaps of integrity, no gimmicks and few concessions to the box office. Its only real flaw is that it strains a bit too hard to be a ""classic"" western. "
2292,darkness-falls-movie,Staff (not credited),10,This moronic horror movie has the earmarks of a disastrous shoot patched up in editing.
2293,mad-max-fury-road-movie,Matt Singer,90,"Even though this is the fourth Mad Max, and it’s indebted to the style of the previous films, Fury Road stands alone. It’s better looking and more thrilling than any of the other installments. The color palette is vibrant and beautiful, and every inch of the frame is crammed with crazy, brilliant ideas."
2294,baby-driver-movie,Terri White,100,"An awe-inspiring piece of filmmaking from Edgar Wright that plays out as a musical through the lens of an action thriller. Sweet, funny and utterly original — you won’t see a film like it this year."
2295,tomb-raider-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,"There are many ways for a movie to go wrong, and Tomb Raider goes wrong in many of the most obvious: It has a generic story, bad writing, a miscast lead, the wrong director and no fun."
2296,ran-re-release-movie,Mark Feeney,88,"In Ran, color plays a role not unlike that of language in ""Lear"": a kind of ground bass of beauty, a product of pure imagination, that both affirms life and surpasses it. Yet Kurosawa uses that beauty more as negation: a reminder not of what man is capable of but how puny he is in comparison. "
2297,the-astronauts-wife-movie,Wesley Morris,25,Stinks from the Earth to the moon.
2298,tokyo!-movie,V.A. Musetto,75,"Carax, who hadn't made a movie since ""Pola X"" in 1999 comes off best."
2299,saving-mr-banks-movie,Chris Nashawaty,83,Saving Mr. Banks is a wholesomely square film about a wholesomely square film. But damned if its sugar doesn't go down like honey.
2300,citizenfour-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,80,"The story Snowden tells is, of course, absorbing, disturbing and, yes, scary. Poitras' film, playing out as more and more is revealed, reported and published, comes off like a real-life spy thriller."
2301,spy-kids-3-d-game-over-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,"It's ''The Matrix'' meets ''TRON'' meets ''Jimmy Neutron,'' with all the cheery (if not cheesy) evanescence of a Jolly Rancher commercial. I mean that as a compliment."
2302,fateless-movie,Peter Rainer,100,This is a Holocaust movie that is so relentlessly observed and so aware of woe that it never feels like it belongs to a genre.
2303,hereditary-movie,A.A. Dowd ,91,"It’s a supremely effective gauntlet of supernatural horror that’s also, at blackened heart, a grueling domestic drama about how trauma, resentment, and guilt can seep into the roots of a family tree, rotting it from the inside out."
2304,dirty-love-movie,Roger Ebert,0,"Dirty Love wasn't written and directed, it was committed. Here is a film so pitiful, it doesn't rise to the level of badness. It is hopelessly incompetent."
2305,in-out-movie,Peter Travers,88,"The butt of the hilarious and heartfelt screenplay by Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey) is homophobia, and his sting is wickedly on target. "
2306,queen-of-katwe-movie,Brian Truitt,75,"There is no lack of Disney-fied melodrama, for sure, yet Queen fights through all that with outstanding acting, deft filmmaking choices and the introduction of a new talent in Madina Nalwanga."
2307,shattered-glass-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"The movie is smart about journalism because it is smart about offices; the typical newsroom is open space filled with desks, and journalists are actors on this stage; to see a good writer on deadline with a big story is to watch not simply work but performance. "
2308,trust-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Within its small, darkly funny range, Trust is an exceptional film that stays alert to the mysteries of love."
2309,walk-the-line-movie,Steven Rea,88,"It's a celebration of the good times and bad times shared by a man and woman who found each other in the middle of some historic craziness, and it rocks."
2310,the-last-station-movie,Kimberley Jones,89,"The Last Station would have satisfied alone as a witty, manic lark, but as it moves toward the titular railway station, the film unfurls into so much more – a work of compassion, modulated mournfulness, and unchecked joy."
2311,the-babadook-movie,Chris Nashawaty,83,"In an age when horror movies have mostly become lazy and toothless, here's one with ambition and bite."
2312,wont-back-down-movie,Keith Uhlich,20,"The film slowly reveals its true colors, pointing a fanatically accusatory finger at teachers' unions while using twisted Obama-esque sloganeering about ""order"" and ""hope"" to further its simplistically anticollectivist agenda."
2313,the-post-movie,Keith Phipps,95,There’s not a wasted moment as The Post packs what could be an overwhelming amount of information into a story that ultimately reveals itself as a Capra-esque morality play with deep roots in recent history and a style that sometimes calls back to the paranoid thrillers of the 1970s.
2314,not-another-teen-movie-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,Proves that it's possible to make a movie so tasteless and so crude that audiences don't laugh. This is worthwhile information. It means there's a limit.
2315,whitney-movie,Lara Zarum,70,"By the time Whitney winds to an end, that massive talent feels like a dangerously valuable resource, one that even the people who were supposed to protect Houston couldn’t resist exploiting."
2316,the-wild-life-movie,Tom Russo,38,"The Wild Life, while pleasant, is just too flat to meet the challenge."
2317,vera-drake-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,78,"In an era in which too many of us automatically accept women's right to choose, Vera Drake reminds us that the time for complacency is not now."
2318,happy-gilmore-movie,Staff (Not credited),30,Sorry excuse for a comedy.
2319,girl-interrupted-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"Shrewd, tough, and lively -- a junior-league ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."""
2320,the-last-house-on-the-left-movie,Mark Olsen,10,A shockingly mundane disappointment taken on its own and a deeply misguided refraction of the original.
2321,bird-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Bird wisely does not attempt to ""explain"" Parker's music by connecting experiences with musical discoveries. This is a film of music, not about it, and one of the most extraordinary things about it is that we are really, literally, hearing Parker on the soundtrack."
2322,my-summer-of-love-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"Its stars, Emily Blunt and Natalie Press, are film newcomers who give startling performances. The photography is often breathtakingly original."
2323,heaven-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Odd, and awkward in places, but its lyricism and power stay with you."
2324,step-brothers-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"There's a good subject for satire here, the extended adolescence of American kids. But satire presupposes maturity, or at least some perspective. The movie's calculation is that its subjects and audience share the same point of view. The results are truly ghastly."
2325,the-mechanic-movie,Mary Pols,70,"Quick, capable, thoroughly bloody action film."
2326,the-monster-movie,Andrew Crump,83,"It’s what we don’t see, at least not in full, that makes the film scare so effectively. Bertino holds his monster in reserve, conceding its presence through brief and mostly obscured glimpses of its shape. "
2327,10000-km-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"It’s hard to know what to make of this, but it’s quite enough that it happens at all. The film has some longueurs — it isn’t scintillating for every second of screen time. But Marques-Mercet and his actors establish an intimacy with the audience that’s practically unique. Even if you love it only a little, not completely, you will probably remember 10,000 Km for the rest of your life."
2328,staying-vertical-movie,Justin Chang,90,"Its title a sly reference to what distinguishes men from beasts, Staying Vertical hinges on the tension between primal instincts and socially proscribed behavior. Guiraudie isn’t just trying to decimate sexual taboos; he is also taking gently comic aim at the overly rigid roles into which people tend to lock themselves."
2329,fair-game-movie,Rene Rodriguez,0,"Some clumsy nips and tucks later, Fair Game still doesn't make sense, and Crawford's performance still cracks you up. [03 Nov 1995]"
2330,theeb-movie,Jay Weissberg,90,"Like all well-done adventure tales, especially those with an intimate human focus and an expansive, epic vision, “Theeb” works on multiple levels."
2331,venus-movie,Jim Ridley,80,"Maurice, the protagonist of Venus, is a suit lovingly tailored to O'Toole's ravaged but commanding frame."
2332,isle-of-dogs-movie,David Edelstein,100,"It’s a series of moving paintings, tableaux vivants, a goofy dog comedy, a grim totalitarian allegory. It’s sui generis. It’s the damnedest thing."
2333,i-called-him-morgan-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,Kasper Collin’s splendid documentary feature starts with an event that shook the jazz world.
2334,bravetown-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,12,"I would call the movie a trainwreck, except it’s really four or five separate trainwrecks. "
2335,savannah-movie,Tina Hassannia,12,The film is impossible to take seriously as a commemoration of Moultrie's life or Allen's prolific status because of its plethora of contrivances.
2336,parker-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"The essence of this grindingly violent movie can be summed up by what Parker says of his handgun to a terrified clerk at a check-cashing service: ""It's small, but it hurts."""
2337,caterina-va-in-citta-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,"Though ""Caterina"" is unusually well-acted and crafted for this kind of movie--and both more than casually insightful and irreverent about modern Italian school life, teenage mores and politics--Giancarlo is the one character who makes the movie special."
2338,another-earth-movie,Ty Burr,63,"Another Earth is being sold as an indie sci-fi drama, but that does both the movie and its proper audience a disservice. This muted story of atonement, forgiveness, and parallel universes is more of an extended metaphor - a work of earnest poetry rather than science."
2339,son-of-the-bride-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"Has an appealing modesty, but director Juan José Campanella works so hard to keep everything soft and winsome and charming that he cushions the understatement into blandness."
2340,cocktail-movie,Richard Corliss,0,"Cocktail, has no reason for being other than to market the Cruise charm like a cheap celebrity perfume. It is a bottle of rotgut in a Dom Perignon box. [8 August 1988, p.68]"
2341,black-rose-movie,Craig D. Lindsey,0,"Let’s cut straight to the chase: Black Rose is a bad film — amazingly, astoundingly, supercalifragilisticexpialidociously bad."
2342,dinner-rush-movie,David Edelstein,90,A marvelously nasty revenge comedy.
2343,the-new-guy-movie,Gene Seymour,10,An unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years. Which can be the only rational explanation for making such a mess all over the screen.
2344,knight-and-day-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"The source of this movie's energy is near-perpetual desperation. You can see it in Tom Cruise's fixed grin, and in the mad proliferation of unspecial effects."
2345,son-of-the-mask-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"What we basically have here is a license for the filmmakers to do whatever they want to do with the special effects, while the plot, like Wile E. Coyote, keeps running into the wall."
2346,meduzot-movie,Kenneth Turan,80,"Yes, Jellyfish says, it's a wonderful life, not in that old-fashioned style we've perhaps tired of but in a surprising new and magical way all its own."
2347,atl-movie,Peter L'Official,70,"It's entertainment with ambition, but I can't front though; the soundtrack is pretty fly too."
2348,we-movie,Nathan Rabin,25,"For the scandal-prone icon behind the camera - who glibly writes off all that talk about her subjects' Nazi sympathies as slanderous nonsense from a jealous, hateful press and gossipy busybodies - the film might as well be called ME. "
2349,undercover-brother-movie,Joe Leydon,80,A frequently inspired hit-and-miss burlesque that definitely hits more than it misses.
2350,head-in-the-clouds-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,30,"Duigan has the makings of a good yarn, but instead of trusting the story and his characters, he becomes fatally bogged down in trying to make statements. "
2351,the-dictator-movie,Eric Kohn,83,"Transitioning back into a scripted dynamic after his quasi-documentary performance excursions with ""Bruno"" and ""Borat,"" Baron Cohen loses none of his edge, combining slapstick inspiration and social commentary into a hilariously provocative blend."
2352,catch-hell-movie,Wes Greene,38,"The story allows for Ryan Phillippe to indulge in a self-deprecating brand of satire, but he can't work up enough courage to ever make his character--and, by extension, himself--the brunt of any of the film's barbs."
2353,the-ninth-gate-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,38,"A film that really has no idea what it wants to be, so it tries a little of everything, and does nothing very well."
2354,sweet-november-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Sara is supposed to be an adorable screwball with a fatal disease. Ms. Theron certainly gets the adorable right. With a comic style that's close to unerring, she not only deserves better than this junk but the very best."
2355,ninja-assassin-movie,Brian Miller,30,"A triple-cross plot with Harris's superiors doesn't help the movie's clarity--neither does the clattering sound design. Shouldn't throwing stars be silent? If they're gonna sound like gunshots, why not just use guns?"
2356,abundant-acreage-available-movie,Eric Kohn,75,"Set in a single location with a cast of five, the movie offers a lesson in minimalist drama, unfolding as a sharply acted mood piece that never crescendos, but hums along with wise observations and first-rate performances."
2357,money-buys-happiness-movie,A.O. Scott,20,"About 20 minutes in, it is clear that the couple will emerge as nothing more than crabby yuppies whose articulation of their pouts sounds like the same argument over and over again."
2358,shes-all-that-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"A teen comedy that actually puts a priority on intelligence and values and spans generations in its appeal, emerging as a special delight for anyone for whom high school was something less than nirvana. [29 Jan 1999, p.6]"
2359,serving-sara-movie,Desson Thomson,0,"As a child, I thought pure hell meant eternal agony in the flames of Satan. Now I know it's looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara isn't even halfway through."
2360,geostorm-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"Not a single character or the jeopardy that they find themselves in – end of the entire human race and all – is likable, canine-in-peril excluded."
2361,fantastic-four-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"It needed a star like Clooney at its center, and a character actor like Alan Rickman as Dr. Doom. You don't expect realism from a comic-book movie, but you do want the characters to seem larger than life."
2362,the-passenger-re-release-movie,Shawn Levy,83,It's refreshing that something once considered terribly new and modern can still feel contemporary three decades later.
2363,nobel-son-movie,Liam Lacey,25,"The movie is so relentlessly self-congratulatory, you can't help becoming thoroughly sick of it."
2364,the-wedding-planner-movie,David Sterritt,0,"Frankly, it's excruciating to watch."
2365,the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn---part-1-movie,James Berardinelli,63,Here's hoping Breaking Dawn Part Two gives us more of what Part One provided in the final 30 minutes than what it forced viewers to endure to get there. 
2366,formula-51-movie,Edward Guthmann,25,"It isn't simple bad taste that Formula 51 deals in, but a total vacuum of feeling."
2367,stigmata-movie,Justine Elias,20,An incomprehensible mess.
2368,bringing-down-the-house-movie,Keith Phipps,30,Yet another comedy that suggests someone should take Martin aside and remind him that he can do better. 
2369,the-13th-warrior-movie,Peter Brunette,30,"With the possible exception of the action sequences and the occassionally imaginitive set design, it's awful."
2370,the-rage-carrie-2-movie,B.J. Sigesmund,30,"It's just a standard, mediocre horror flick that wants to be taken seriously. The creators missed the point entirely: even teenagers know that there's no audience for this type of film anymore."
2371,lovelace-movie,Rob Nelson,30,"Reducing an immensely disturbing, politically byzantine tale to a series of cartoonish vignettes, this celeb-studded biopic squanders a gutsy performance by Amanda Seyfried."
2372,jawbreaker-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,It's so low it scrapes through the barrel and deep into the earth's core. It's the lowest piece of garbage to hit screens in months.
2373,breaking-the-waves-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,30,"For this mortal, the film converts piety into pathology and then converts it back again at the end with a Song of Bernadette conclusion. I don't know what the title means. I do know that this ridiculous film won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.[ Dec. 9, 1996] "
2374,blood-diamond-movie,William Arnold,83,"Zwick's narrative skills keep us hooked on the story, and the first-rate production values and imaginative use of locations (it was shot in Mozambique) give the film an enthralling scope and epic sweep."
2375,bridget-jones-the-edge-of-reason-movie,Keith Phipps,30,"When a sequel has to hit the reset button and take all its characters back to where they started, it probably didn't need to be made. "
2376,my-life-in-ruins-movie,Cliff Doerksen,0,"Mike Reiss's witless, maudlin screenplay is like rancid leachate trickling from a Dumpster full of rotting sitcom scripts, Mary Kay sales manuals, and romance novels."
2377,war-of-the-worlds-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,70,"As is his wont, Spielberg can't resist stuffing the ending of the movie with a bit too much cheese and baloney.  Despite those quibbles, War of the Worlds is taut, gripping and surprisingly dark filmmaking."
2378,the-lucky-one-movie,Ann Hornaday,38,"Director Scott Hicks lavishes good taste and sunsets on a story that - devoid of genuine tension, conflict or combustible chemistry between its two stars - just prettily sits there."
2379,rosewater-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"Jon Stewart’s filmmaking debut Rosewater has much in common with “The Daily Show” — it’s blaringly obvious, it’s naive, it plays to the cheap seats and it’s enamored with cheap jokes."
2380,arabian-nights-volume-2-the-desolate-one-movie,Kate Taylor,75,Gomes believes we should all take responsibility for one another and sees austerity as a government abrogation of social duty that ultimately turns citizen against citizen.
2381,the-human-stain-movie,Desson Thomson,70,"You feel as though you're watching a filmed play rather than a movie. Nothing wrong with that. But The Human Stain, directed more than well enough by Robert Benton, doesn't reach the emotional pitch it's shooting for."
2382,the-gospel-according-to-philip-k-dick-movie,Jonathan Foreman,25,Anyone interested in this remarkably prolific author would be better off visiting a library or bookshop.
2383,head-on-movie,Kimberley Jones,78,"But for all the film's griminess and doom, bad behavior and bad luck, it's hope that engines Head-On."
2384,brokeback-mountain-movie,Anthony Lane,90,"This slow and stoic movie, hailed as a gay Western, feels neither gay nor especially Western: it is a study of love under siege."
2385,monster-in-law-movie,Bill Gallo,30,"Billed as a comedy, this low-wattage sitcom is both ill-tempered and mean-spirited."
2386,mothers-and-daughters-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"For a film that's presumably intended to convey the rich emotional rewards of motherhood, it's not terribly convincing."
2387,rules-dont-apply-movie,Stephen Holden,90,"The wonder of the movie, which Mr. Beatty wrote and directed from a story he wrote with Bo Goldman, is that it is so good-humored. Fools and idiots abound, but demonic, systemic evil does not."
2388,road-house-movie,Sheila Benson,10,"The crushing assault that Road House delivers to fun at the movies is enough to send you crawling out of the theater on hands and knees, bloody and bowed. [19 May 1989, p.C1]"
2389,brads-status-movie,Roger Moore,88,"White finds ways for Stiller to surprise us, and the veteran actor manages to hide his cards in scene after scene, letting us keep up with him, but never ever allowing us to guess where his emotions will take him next, and what form they’ll take."
2390,the-box-movie,J. Hoberman,30,The new Richard Kelly movie is basically a sock of coal for Christmas.
2391,bait-movie,Lisa Alspector,30,This comedy-thriller that has no particular motive for changing tones.
2392,final-destination-5-movie,Scott Bowles,63,"Even by today's horror standards, Destination has some ghastly scenes. After seeing them, parents may want to reconsider letting their daughters try gymnastics or laser eye surgery."
2393,in-my-country-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,It's a bad idea done disastrously.
2394,the-cove-movie,David Edelstein,100,The end of The Cove is as rousing as anything from Hollywood. Manipulative? Sure--but isn't that fitting? Capitalism has driven an entire village to massacre dolphins and keep its work hidden.
2395,the-strangers-movie,James Berardinelli,75,This is one of those rare horror movies that concentrates on suspense and terror rather than on gore and a high body count.
2396,i-now-pronounce-you-chuck-larry-movie,Peter Travers,25,No comedy this year can beat this dud for mealy-mouthed hypocrisy.
2397,i-am-legend-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,"In spirit, I Am Legend is caught in some abstractly doom-laden sci-fi past. For what it is, though, the film is well-done, a case of suspenseful competence trumping questionable relevance."
2398,the-musketeer-movie,Paul Malcolm,20,"Hyams (""End of Days,"" ""Timecop""), who is his own cinematographer, has no idea how to shoot or compose Xiong's wired choreography."
2399,the-sweet-hereafter-movie,John Hartl,80,"It's the survivors of this tragedy that must make peace with their fate, and the film finally rests with them."
2400,elephant-movie,Rene Rodriguez,100,Makes the Columbine shootings seem both abstract yet more painful and vivid. It also gets you excited all over again about the things movies can do.
2401,i-will-follow-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"I Will Follow doesn't tell a story so much as try to understand a woman. Through her, we can find insights into the ways we deal with death. "
2402,moonstruck-movie,Rick Groen,88,"From the first stylized shot to the final comic resolution, Moonstruck is completely sui generis - hard to describe but easy to love."
2403,take-care-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Thin yet excruciating, the film is a quintessential vanity production. The script feels like a first draft that aspired merely to mediocrity and fell well short."
2404,chasing-papi-movie,Mike Clark,25,"Imagine a movie so broadly conceived that it was written, directed and all parts were played by Charo — billed in her '70s heyday of Love Boat gigs as the ""Cuchi-Cuchi Girl."" That's what you get here."
2405,stake-land-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,80,This unusually taut sophomore feature from Jim Mickle is more abnormal than most in that its creatures are capable not only of evolving but also of embracing religious fanaticism. 
2406,a-good-baby-movie,V.A. Musetto,88,An indie gem.
2407,no-end-in-sight-movie,Noel Murray,83,"It's a cogent, often infuriating explication of how the execution of the war went awry."
2408,bringing-out-the-dead-movie,Peter Travers,90,"Cage, who gives a blazing, imposive performance, uses his haunted eyes to reveal the emotional scars that Frank can't heal."
2409,man-on-fire-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,"It's dispiriting to see good actors doing smart, solid work with so much unadulterated garbage swirling around them. Scott's art is also death, and we, the audience, are the ones he's jabbing at with his ruthless paintbrush. It's about time someone told him where to stick it. "
2410,rambo-first-blood-part-ii-movie,Laurie Horn,25,"Cosmatos' constant device of setting up the audience, releasing the tension and then setting up again gives the movie a pacing that is all manipulation. [22 May 1985, p.D1]"
2411,jane-eyre-movie,Peter Travers,75,"Fukunaga, son of a Japanese father and a Swedish mother, is a filmmaker to watch. He has reanimated a classic for a new generation, letting Jane Eyre resonate with terror and tenderness."
2412,chocolat-movie,Dennis Lim,30,"Airy, pseudo-folkloric gibberish at best."
2413,london-movie,J.R. Jones,10,"The awful crank comedy ""Spun"" (2002) still ranks as the most dehumanizing youth picture of the decade, but this New York drama by first-time director Hunter Richards is a close second."
2414,the-last-face-movie,Dave Calhoun,20,"Sean Penn's pompous, ethically bankrupt humanitarian aid drama The Last Face would surely have worked better as a charity single....  Instead, we get this vain mess, a vacuous romance with real human pain as background noise and where the only honest pleasure is waiting to see what misstep it will take next. "
2415,incarnate-movie,Sam Fragoso,15,Issues of continuity and logic pale in comparison to how the film forces Eckhart to act. It’s rare that we see someone as talented as Eckhart be relegated to work this shoddy and dispiriting.
2416,red-riding-hood-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"This tedious retelling of the venerable fairy tale-""Twilight"" with Oedipal kinks-takes place in a medieval village that is plagued by a werewolf, and that looks like a shtetl settled by California actors."
2417,the-outsider-2018-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"Merging standard gangster movie clichés of both the Japanese and American variety, The Outsider only manages to be ultra-violent and ultra-dull simultaneously. "
2418,the-patriot-movie,David Edelstein,70,It's depressing that this first movie in years to dramatize the American Revolution has so little to do with the politics of secession and so much to do with pop-culture themes of vigilantism.
2419,zero-dark-thirty-movie,Calvin Wilson,100,"Unlike too many films these days, Zero Dark Thirty dares to embrace complexity.And that makes it not just state-of-the-art entertainment, but a great film."
2420,american-virgin-movie,Lisa Nesselson,20,Ambitious but flawed comedy.
2421,black-swan-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,"It's all or nothing with Black Swan. Either you embrace its headlong descent into madness brought on by the pressures of artistic perfection, compounded by smothering anxiety, or you reject it. It's that simple."
2422,the-oogieloves-in-the-big-balloon-adventure-movie,Nick Schager,12,Enduring this brainless kid's film is akin to witnessing the end of the world.
2423,in-the-house-movie,Zachary Wigon,90,"In the House is a mystery, but it investigates a far tougher riddle than what makes Claude tick—it's trying to figure out why, exactly, voyeurism and mystery delight us so. In the process, it delights us."
2424,romeo-juliet-movie,Kimberley Jones,30,The film finds some momentum once the bodies start dropping – but maybe that was only the sweet relief in knowing the end was nigh.
2425,clerks-ii-movie,Connie Ogle,75,"Despite the film's sloppy structure, it feels weirdly good to hang out with these losers again."
2426,mr-mrs-smith-movie,Ken Tucker,80,A cool summer thriller whose laughs don't slow down the suspense.
2427,hot-tub-time-machine-2-movie,Nathan Rabin,20,The humor is seldom character-based: It’s more a matter of actors saying whatever outrageous thing springs to mind at that moment.
2428,ted-2-movie,Drew Taylor,25,"Ted 2 gives lip service to civil liberties and spends the rest of the running time picking the easiest joke to tell, again and again and again."
2429,final-destination-2-movie,Bruce Fretts,33,The only pleasure to be derived from the resulting carnage comes from the Rube Goldbergesque chain reactions that precede each fatality.
2430,popstar-never-stop-never-stopping-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"“Popstar” takes aim at everything that is artificial and plastic in contemporary pop in a spirit of love rather than spite. It’s a celebration of the curious authenticity — the innocence, the sweetness, the guiltless pleasure — of music whose badness is sometimes hard to separate from its genius."
2431,the-greatest-game-ever-played-movie,Jason Anderson,63,"The Greatest Game Ever Played is far too inconsistent to be great, but at least Paxton has made an honourable attempt to treat this piece of sports history with the gravity it deserves."
2432,gi-joe-retaliation-movie,Mark Jenkins,25,"What's the difference between an action figure and an action star? Very little in G.I. Joe: Retaliation, which features no performances of note, even from such combat-tested thespians as Bruce Willis, Jonathan Pryce and Dwayne Johnson."
2433,cobb-movie,Richard Schickel,70,"This is a messy movie, sometimes repetitive, sometimes too compressed and allusive. But that's like saying Ty Cobb was not a very good sport -- irrelevant in comparison to the horrific fascination of his story."
2434,dinosaur-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,An expensive demonstration that all the spectacular effects in the world aren't enough to make a great film - but it's worth seeing for that stunning half-hour alone.
2435,jawbreaker-movie,Ernest Hardy,10,"It’s like watching an annoying young drag queen who flubs the quips she’s stolen, refuses to shut up and thinks attitude is wit."
2436,star-wars-episode-i---the-phantom-menace-movie,Robert Horton,30,"Computer technology may be the actual phantom menace, after all."
2437,bones-movie,Michael Dequina,10,"Nothing sums up Bones better than its parting shot, in which maggots are projectile vomited directly toward the audience. How so very appropriate."
2438,taking-lives-movie,Shawn Levy,16,Pretty much the worst recent example of a genre. 
2439,ballet-422-movie,Zachary Wigon,90,"Ballet 422 is more visually sumptuous than most narratives you're likely to see this year, featuring careful compositions that make watching the film an aesthetic experience as much as an intellectual one."
2440,garden-state-movie,Peter Debruge,100,"Garden State gets it. Not since ""The Graduate"" has a movie nailed the beautiful terror of standing on the brink of adulthood with such satisfying precision. "
2441,man-on-the-train-movie,Michael Sragow,100,"Man on the Train may be a modest film, but it offers privileged glimpses of transcendence."
2442,yellowbrickroad-movie,G. Allen Johnson,25,A letdown despite its intriguing premise.
2443,clash-of-the-titans-movie,Cliff Doerksen,30,This remake is interesting mainly for the chance to see top-flight acting talent labor over dialogue so leaden you could cast bullets from it.
2444,license-to-wed-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"The only thing that kept me watching License to Wed until the end (apart from being paid to do so) was the faith, perhaps misplaced, that I will not see a worse movie this year."
2445,the-five-senses-movie,Michael Atkinson,30,"Beautifully shot and littered with disquieting character business, the film is hog-tied by its own bad Big Idea."
2446,88minutes-movie,Keith Phipps,16,"Actually, it's pretty much the definition of absurd."
2447,landline-movie,Jordan Raup,75,"Landline is a film about many things: sisterhood, infidelity, growing up, marriage, parenting, self-discovery, etc. That it manages to have illuminating insights about each, and none feeling like they are taking the backseat, is a feat unto itself."
2448,the-night-of-the-hunter-re-release-movie,Adam Smith,100,"Ignored for a long time, this film is now impossible to ignore. Mitchum is magnetic."
2449,mustang-movie,Leah Greenblatt,91,"It’s not hard to see why Mustang has been dubbed the “Turkish Virgin Suicides.” Like Sofia Coppola’s dreamy, unsettling 1999 debut, it’s another first film by a young female director that focuses in feverish close-up on the adolescent awakening of five restless, radiant sisters — and the ruin that follows when their family tries to contain it. "
2450,the-little-mermaid-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"This return to traditional Disney territory is geared to captivate children while allowing them to maintain their street cred, largely by combining extravagant animated technique with ranging musical styles. "
2451,le-divorce-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,A generally mirthless comedy of manners.
2452,avenue-montaigne-movie,Maitland McDonagh,75,"Thompson's stories are familiar, but she weaves them together with such assurance and good humor that they're equally soothing and thoroughly enjoyable."
2453,boomerang-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,It's not even funny. Nor does it contain half the wit or charm as the old Doris Day sex comedies it so resembles.
2454,silk-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"By the end of Francois Gerard's plodding, uninvolving melodrama, his boredom will have nothing on yours."
2455,the-only-living-boy-in-new-york-movie,Alonso Duralde,15,"This is a movie full of characters you would walk away from at a cocktail party, engaging in the flattest brand of smart banter imaginable."
2456,gigantic-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"Inert, incompetent and emotionally fraudulent."
2457,rivers-edge-movie,Alan Morrison,80,"A disquieting tale set in the grim realities of trashy America. Some great, often insane performances make it a memorable trip."
2458,wah-wah-movie,Marc Savlov,67,Never less than good but it's also never quite great.
2459,the-other-side-of-the-door-movie,Geoff Berkshire,30,"The type of sporadically silly and patently predictable horror pic that would look like filler on Syfy’s weekend lineup, The Other Side of the Door brings virtually nothing new to the supernatural genre."
2460,borat-cultural-learnings-of-america-for-make-benefit-glorious-nation-of-kazakhstan-movie,Claudia Puig,88,Borat is most gloriously funny moving picture for to make people see their stupidness.
2461,braveheart-movie,Rick Groen,75,"Despite a formidable effort and occasional grace, there's something cowardly about Braveheart -- it's an aspiring giant with a diminutive soul."
2462,keep-the-lights-on-movie,Bob Mondello,85,"The film, though, is as sure-footed as their partnership is not - a nuanced portrait of emotional turmoil, persuasively acted, richly sensual one moment, wrenching the next, and unlike so many films centering on gay characters, not particularly concerned with things like coming out or HIV."
2463,lost-souls-movie,Cody Clark,6,The only thing about this movie that will haunt you is its boggling ineptitude.
2464,the-legend-of-hercules-movie,Keith Phipps,20,"Where 300 made a virtue of its low budget by stripping the visuals down to their essential elements, the shot-in-Bulgaria Legend Of Hercules mostly just looks rushed and cheap, only coming to life in a handful of fight scenes, and then only briefly."
2465,15-minutes-movie,Manohla Dargis,0,"Isn't just rotten -- badly acted, badly written, badly conceived -- it's dead inside."
2466,see-spot-run-movie,Sean Axmaker,0,It's hard to believe that five different writers took credit for this feeble story and script. Who says failure is an orphan?
2467,tracks-movie,Thomas Lee,100,That Robyn succeeds reaching her geographic destination is hardly a surprise. But this movie is not driven by plot but rather the delicate emotional ballet performed so expertly by Wasikowska. 
2468,september-dawn-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,0,"The maudlin, grotesque western September Dawn, about the massacre on Sept. 11, 1857, of about 120 settlers by Mormons (and their Paiute Indian mercenaries), apes ""Schindler’s List"" in hopes of creating a Christian Holocaust picture."
2469,analyze-this-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,Watching Ramis struggle with his two stars is like watching someone try to juggle lead weights.
2470,pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales-movie,Brian Truitt,75,"Johnny Depp’s drunken Captain Jack Sparrow stumbles into yet another seafaring adventure, which has its rocky moments but also offers an engaging tale with family legacies, above-average swashbuckling and a fantastic new villain courtesy of Javier Bardem"
2471,chandni-chowk-to-china-movie,David Chute,20,"Alas, Chandni Chowk to China, directed by Nikhil Advani, is asymmetrical in the extreme: shapeless, shameless, and slapdash."
2472,promised-land-movie,Marc Mohan,75,"The rhetorically stacked deck, and some unconvincing third-act plot twists, get in the way of this movie's efforts to reach the cinematic promised land of true greatness. "
2473,away-from-her-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"As this intimate, beautifully observed film unfolds, you realize that the story's themes -- the nature of love, the role of sex in relationships and the ways in which we learn to make peace with our guilty consciences -- are relevant no matter what age you happen to be."
2474,safe-house-movie,Manohla Dargis,70,Essentially and very effectively a rollicking smash-and-crash chase movie that happens to be surprisingly well acted. 
2475,brokeback-mountain-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,"It's possible to point to some weak spots in Brokeback – its seeming multiple endings, the lack of clarity about certain images, some digressions – but there is no movie this year that has moved my heart more than Brokeback Mountain."
2476,keeping-up-with-the-steins-movie,Bill White,0,"There is potential for laughs in a satire of rich people spending big money on religious galas, but that is not even the real subject of the picture."
2477,the-romantics-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"The Romantics is a misnomer. ""The Spoiled Melodramatics"" would be more accurate. Or better yet, ""The Pretentious Ones."""
2478,on-the-line-movie,Roger Ebert,25,An agonizingly creaky movie that laboriously plods through a plot so contrived that the only thing real about it is its length.
2479,crossing-over-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,"As Crossing Over makes its patronizing points, by way of two-dimensional characters and billboarded plot points, it recalls other, better movies that dealt with the same subjects far more deftly."
2480,nobody-knows-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,Nobody Knows is the rare film that successfully tells its tale of childhood from the children’s point of view.
2481,star-trek-beyond-movie,Peter Rainer,83,I do hope there will be many more future installments. I’d like to spend more time with these folks. 
2482,tomcats-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,0,Go expecting the very worst. Just don't expect to laugh.
2483,the-congress-movie,Eric Kohn,100,A wholly original and thoroughly surprising fusion of sensory overload and liberal philosophy bound to confuse and provoke in equal measures.
2484,brotherhood-of-the-wolf-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"This one's a turkey as big as the Eiffel Tower but it's bad in a particularly American way: It's wildly overdone, it throws in everything in an attempt to appeal to everyone, it's gargantuan and anti-logical, pointlessly ornate and pointlessly violent."
2485,rocknrolla-movie,Nick Pinkerton,10,Sum total of scenes that deserved to stay in the final cut: Thandie Newton doing a little shimmying frug.
2486,end-of-days-movie,Ann Hornaday,0,"Idiotic, ugly and ridiculous."
2487,the-theory-of-everything-movie,Kenneth Turan,80,"Marsh makes the most of McCarten's effective script. There's a real energy to his filmmaking, the ability to be intelligently dramatic without overdoing things that is ideally suited to material that would be so easy to get wrong."
2488,orphan-movie,Cliff Doerksen,0,"Screenwriters David Johnson and Alex Mace deliver one of the stupidest ""twist endings"" in the history of storytelling."
2489,all-about-my-mother-movie,Jami Bernard,100,Almodovar is adept at weaving together strands you'd never guess would match.
2490,below-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"In the handsome, haunting submarine thriller Below, the usual perils of deep-sea maneuvers are heightened by psychic unraveling."

2493,the-decline-of-western-civilization-part-iii-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Unlike the first two Decline films, this one is only tangentially concerned with music."

2495,2-days-in-new-york-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Ridiculously funny, ridiculously charming."
2496,punch-drunk-love-movie,Peter Travers,100,Anderson orchestrates a comic romance like no other. The effect is intoxicating. Sandler and the movie will knock you for a loop.
2497,jumanji-movie,John Leland,20,"Director Joe Johnston (""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"") turns this fantasy into a mean-spirited exercise in terror."
2498,grown-ups-2-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,11,The Land of Lazy can crown a new king because with Grown Ups 2 Adam Sandler has officially nabbed the throne.
2499,20-dates-movie,David Edelstein,20,I wouldn't exactly call it entertainment; I found myself wanting to apologize on behalf of obnoxious heterosexual Jewish men the world over.
2500,topsy-turvy-movie,Mike Clark,100,One of the year's best movies and certainly its most delightful screen surprise.
2501,end-of-days-movie,Kevin Maynard,18,"Such a witless, bombastic, by-the-numbers hunk of millennial hooey it made me nostalgic for Commando. This one throws in every hoary hellfire cliché."
2502,sorority-boys-movie,Jami Bernard,25,"Recycles the most obvious jokes from similar comedies that preceded it, such as ""Tootsie,"" but with the most rudimentary characters."
2503,bad-santa-movie,K.J. Doughton,20,"A frozen pile of reindeer droppings. The cinematic equivalent to passing a kidney stone, Zwigoff’s unholy foray into “dark comedy” gives us a suicidal, sociopathic drunk slinging swear words with a ferocity that would make Tony Montana wince."
2504,meet-the-mormons-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"Essentially a feature-length advertisement for the Mormon Church which makes AT&T's ""Reach Out and Touch Someone"" TV commercials seem edgy by comparison, Meet the Mormons is strictly for the converted."
2505,machine-gun-preacher-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,25,"It gets the bullet points of Sam Childers's life, but misses the target."
2506,the-bye-bye-man-movie,A.A. Dowd ,16,"On top of the general hoariness, this is also an uncommonly, at times unbelievably inept movie; from its acting to its script to most of its technical aspects, it feels barely fit for the big screen."
2507,the-heir-apparent-largo-winch-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,The movie is a mess. 
2508,a-mighty-wind-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,It's a fine-grained picture that goes for the sideways laughs rather than the straight-ahead ones. This is sketch comedy as method acting.
2509,the-rider-movie,Bilge Ebiri,100,"Zhao takes a different approach, privileging the narrative, the poetry, and the realism in equal measure, blending them together to create something astonishingly powerful."
2510,the-fall-movie,Sean Axmaker,91,A deliciously vivid adventure fantasy.
2511,deadpool-2-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,80,"Deadpool 2 is, above all else, a lot of fun. (And yes, you must stay for the post-credit scenes.) Sometimes it maybe doesn’t take itself seriously enough (after about the 50th crack you do kind of want to tell Reynolds to hold off for a minute). But in a genre that takes itself so deadly seriously, this is like a breath of fresh air."
2512,pokemon-the-movie-2000-movie,Michael Wilmington,25,"Mind-numbing sequel to ""Pokemon the First Movie."""
2513,halloween-ii-1981-movie,Staff (Not Credited),20,There are incredibly almost never any really terrific scares in 92 minutes - just multiple shots of violence and gore that are more gruesome than anything else.
2514,man-of-tai-chi-movie,Michael Atkinson,30,"The film is stale Chinese popcorn from the get-go, with only Chen's wiry guilelessness and wicked athletic skills to keep it remotely edible."
2515,the-human-centipede-first-sequence-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Unlike its obvious influence, the 1999 Japanese shocker ""Audition,"" The Human Centipede has no real-world echoes. It's an only-in-the-movies sick goof."
2516,it-follows-movie,Tom Huddleston,100,"It’s impossible adequately to describe the haunting intensity of It Follows: this is a film that makes a virtue of silence, that lives in the shadowy spaces between the splattery kill scenes that punctuate your average stalk-and-slasher."
2517,i-feel-pretty-movie,Sara Stewart,38,"With seemingly no understanding of how tone-deaf it might be to cast a straight, white, able-bodied blonde like Schumer as victimized by society’s judgment, the lazily written I Feel Pretty takes a talented comic and casts her in the worst possible light (and I don’t mean that literally — she looks fine)."
2518,mysteries-of-lisbon-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"The result is a dull, high-minded soap opera."
2519,mena-movie,Tim Grierson,72,"Despite its shortcomings, American Made can be deceptively nuanced, as Liman and Cruise put care into their depiction of a natural born charmer who may eventually find his luck has run out."
2520,tyler-perrys-the-single-moms-club-movie,Bilge Ebiri,30,"The problem here isn’t the writer-director’s politics, but his stifling lack of imagination, his complete refusal to even attempt narrative dexterity."
2521,the-perfect-man-movie,Marrit Ingman,30,"The Perfect Man is like Teen People come to life. It's perfectly PG, and it's probably not the worst thing a young lady could see, depending on your criteria. Cinematically, it's like watching your lawn grow."
2522,mondays-in-the-sun-movie,Shawn Levy,67,The lack of sentimentality and rhetoric is refreshing. It's a grown-up movie about some harsh facts of life. 
2523,home-on-the-range-movie,Sara Brady,12,Suffocatingly boring. 
2524,why-him-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,10,"Why Him? is trite, crass and insultingly moronic."
2525,macbeth-2015-movie,Steven Rea,75,"If Macbeth comes off at times like a Classics Illustrated comic-book adaptation (there is one, from 1955), it can also be quite moving, quite troubling, haunting, even. "
2526,happily-never-after-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"If you really want the kids to see a colorfully cryptic meta fairy tale, be subversive and go rent 'em some Alejandro Jodorowsky. No child deserves Happily N'Ever After."
2527,midnight-in-paris-movie,Ella Taylor,75,"But lo! Isn't that Owen Wilson, blond and goyische to the gills, yet faithfully replicating the put-upon slump of the Allen shoulders, the quavering stammers about art vs. success, literature vs. Hollywood?"
2528,music-and-lyrics-movie,Connie Ogle,25,"Inherently laughable, but in all the wrong ways."
2529,deadpool-movie,A.A. Dowd ,67,"The eccentric touches—a Wham! musical cue, a dash of screwball body horror—are just accents on a stealth franchise extension. At a certain point, you have to do more than just recognize and point out the mold. You have to actually shatter it."
2530,brads-status-movie,Rex Reed,88,"The surprising results are unlike anything I’ve seen lately, and the best surprise of all is a funny, inspired and career-enhancing star performance by Ben Stiller that left me touched, applauding and laughing out loud."
2531,bad-santa-2-movie,Soren Andersen,12,"If ever there was a movie that should never have been made, Bad Santa 2 is that movie. It’s vile, like something written by a pen dipped in bile."
2532,eight-crazy-nights-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"Festooned with yards of gross-out jokes, sniggering allusions and, astonishingly, a sentimental climax that's more repellent than any of the crude effluvia the film is drenched with."
2533,hide-and-seek-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,Robert De Niro collects another stupendous paycheck for starring in another piece of exploitable junk.
2534,independence-day-resurgence-movie,Chris Nashawaty,0,Disposable and shockingly inept.
2535,the-impossible-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Watts is extraordinary - she manages both the physical and emotional demands of the role, with soul-deep conviction."
2536,teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movie,Peter Travers,0,"Teenagers, even non-ninjas and non-turtles, have been eating up this cinematic waste product for weeks now. In one way, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a triumph for producer Michael Bay in that it is equally as godawful as his ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" and a hit nonetheless."
2537,ice-age-collision-course-movie,Eric Henderson,38,"If Ice Age: Collision Course gleefully fails at being a history lesson, at least it offers an energetic recess from reality."
2538,the-baader-meinhof-complex-movie,Manohla Dargis,90,"A taut, unnerving, forcefully unromantic fictional film."
2539,red-planet-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"I don't know the actual budget of this adventure yarn, but it feels like a middle-range effort whose heart is with the bargain-basement offerings of yesteryear."
2540,much-ado-about-something-movie,A.O. Scott,70,An inviting piece of film. Mr. Rubbo's cast of characters have the charisma of true devotees and stoked egos that match their intentions.
2541,happy-christmas-movie,Betsy Sharkey,80,"All in all, Happy Christmas is a good deal like cartoon Charlie Brown's classic tree — scraggly, plenty of heart and much to enjoy, especially if you prefer your presents homemade."
2542,a-very-harold-kumar-christmas-movie,Amy Biancolli,25,"Let us recall that the first film was, in its blithely vulgar way, hilarious. And let us demand a moratorium on coked-out-baby jokes, which seriously kill the buzz."
2543,my-best-friend-movie,Glenn Kenny,75,"A droll, poignant comedy enlivened by two terrific performances."
2544,think-like-a-man-too-movie,Frank Scheck,20,"Coming across as more than a little desperate in its unrelenting freneticism, Think Like a Man Too possesses none of the charm of its predecessor. By the time the seemingly endless film reaches its conclusion, you’ll wish that what happened in Vegas had stayed in Vegas."
2545,the-filth-and-the-fury-movie,Jim Sullivan,88,This is a warts 'n' all portrayal - there's no dodging the feelings of both disgust and amusement.
2546,revenge-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,"What’s as striking as the violence is Fargeat’s confidence as a filmmaker. She risks absurdity at every turn, fearlessly daring the audience to accept unlikely scenarios. Take that challenge. However difficult “Revenge” may be to watch at times, it’s worth it."
2547,crush-movie,Michael Atkinson,0,"Manipulative tragedy, muddled motivations, incongruous reconciliations, deranged cuteness, all of it directed with a tin ear and laden with a score that evokes the experience of a conditioned lab rat."
2548,chicken-run-movie,William Arnold,100,People who have seen it seem to be crazy about it.
2549,the-horse-boy-movie,Ann Hornaday,80,"A lovely, amazing, wonderfully provocative film."
2550,in-the-heart-of-the-sea-movie,Christopher Gray,25,"The narrative is helplessly adrift, a yarn that extols vague grit and determination with no discernible through line. "
2551,4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"This is a powerful film and a stark visual accomplishment, but no thanks to Gabita (Laura Vasiliu). The driving character is her roommate Otilia (Anamaria Marinca), who does all the heavy lifting."
2552,lumumba-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"Although the narration is addressed to his wife, we learn little about her, his family or his personal life; he is used primarily as a guide through the milestones of the Congo's brief two-month experiment with democracy."
2553,the-big-bounce-movie,Connie Ogle,38,"Mostly, though, The Big Bounce isn't offensive, or even terrible. It's just lazy, relying on numb moviegoers to fork over cash thinking they'll see the next ""Get Shorty"" or ""Out of Sight."" "
2554,the-ladies-man-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"Another cheesy, overdrawn and witless ""Saturday Night Live"" takeoff."
2555,the-lorax-movie,Pete Hammond,80,"This is purely warm, wonderful, wise and hilarious family entertainment that is fantastic movie fun for everyone. "
2556,the-truth-about-lies-movie,Kimber Myers,10,"On a single day, the protagonist of The Truth About Lies is fired from his job, his apartment burns down and his girlfriend dumps him. He has it easy compared to anyone who actually watches this thoroughly unpleasant, unfunny comedy."
2557,love-1969-movie,Steve Persall,100,"With Amour, it's the rare feeling of watching a masterpiece unfold."
2558,a-cinderella-story-movie,Jason Anderson,25,"A Cinderella Story has little of the smarts that distinguished this spring's big teen hit, ""Mean Girls"", which starred Duff's arch-rival, Lindsay Lohan. Whereas that film presented a genuinely complex and enjoyably snarky portrait of modern teen life, this effort is content to be another candy-coloured fantasy."
2559,carol-movie,Tim Robey,100,"Carol is gorgeous, gently groundbreaking, and might be the saddest thing you’ll ever see. More than hugely accomplished cinema, it’s an exquisite work of American art, rippling with a very specific mid-century melancholy, understanding love as the riskiest but most necessary gamble in anyone’s experience."
2560,vanilla-sky-movie,Steven Rea,63,"Visually dazzling but ultimately dizzying ride, a trippy suspenser that gets tripped up on its own deja vu voodoo."
2561,masculine-feminine-re-release-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"One of the quintessential '60s foreign art films, a bizarre melange of pop music, revolution, sex, movie allusions and poetry. It's a masterpiece of sorts by one of the most important European filmmakers of that era. But it's also a movie that can drive you crazy."
2562,trixie-movie,J. Hoberman,10,As overlong and undermotivated as it is absentmindedly incoherent.
2563,some-like-it-hot-movie,Angie Errigo,100,"Key to its success - along with its vivid characters and brilliant performances - is the snappy pace throughout. Non-stop gags, invention, twists and comic incident flow, as Joe and Jerry - sexy Curtis and screamingly funny Lemmon - elude mob boss George Raft by wriggling into an all-girl jazz band, with Josephine and Daphne’s legendary drag act taking in amorous adventures, seductive deceptions and madcap pursuits. "
2564,cabin-boy-movie,Brian Lowry,0,"Obnoxious, snide and pointless , this ill-fated spoof carries the bonus of being as crude and gamy as the hold of an old fishing barge."
2565,death-of-a-president-movie,Kyle Smith,12,The only thing that's shocking about Death of a President is how boring it is.
2566,forces-of-nature-movie,Gina Fattore  ,0,Monstrously offensive movie.
2567,in-the-name-of-my-daughter-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Lacking a smoking gun, this Riviera-set crime thriller lacks both thrills and convincing evidence of a crime. “Poetic license” or not, that doesn’t add up to an engrossing film."
2568,the-little-mermaid-movie,Michael Wilmington,90,"Impudent, grandiose, a multilevel crowd-pleaser--almost returns the Disney animated features to their glory traditions of the '30s and '40s."
2569,it-2016-movie,Sherilyn Connelly,0,"Whatever cautionary point I.T. may be trying to make about privacy gets lost in the formulaic ugliness, and not even the constant stream of facepalm moments make it entertaining or watchable."
2570,the-nutcracker-movie,Dana Stevens,0,"This non-balletic adaptation by the Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky is something gnarled and stunted and wrong, something that should never have been allowed to see the light of day. How's that for a holiday-ad pullquote?"
2571,nobody-knows-movie,Carla Meyer,100,"The film, winsome and tragic at once and finely attuned to the rhythms of childhood, always seems quite close to real life."
2572,doc-hollywood-movie,Staff (Not Credited),70,"Caton-Jones views all the characters with undisguised affection; the whole thing bubbles along nicely in a fresh, witty, unselfconscious manner, making you forget the dated Capra-corn message."
2573,jawbreaker-movie,Mike Clark,12,"An air of self-congratulation hangs over the empty tank of gas called Jawbreaker, as if writer-director Darren Stein just can't wait to dazzle us with the gaudy visuals he's soldered onto a standard-issue black-comedy script."
2574,the-perfect-storm-movie,David Ansen,70,"Impersonal Hollywood filmmaking at its most paradoxical. It keeps you glued to your seat, and leaves no aftertaste whatsoever."
2575,encino-man-movie,Staff (Not Credited),10,Encino Man is a mindless would-be comedy aimed at the younger set. Low-budget quickie is insulting even within its own no-effort parameters.
2576,only-god-forgives-movie,David Edelstein,0,"In my own world, Only God Forgives plays somewhat differently. I thought it was just about the worst f---ing thing I’ve ever seen. In fact, I was depressed it wasn’t laughed off the screen."
2577,silent-light-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"What the film is really about is people who see themselves and their values as an organic whole. There are no pious displays here. No sanctimony, no preaching. Never even the word ""religion."" Just Johan, Esther and Marianne, all doing their best."
2578,deliver-us-from-evil-2014-movie,Amy Nicholson,30,"Despite the screaming gore, the movie is so rote that it can’t even rouse us for the de rigueur exorcism."
2579,word-wars-movie,David Sterritt,75,"Light, lively, informative, fun."
2580,10-to-midnight-movie,Roger Ebert,0,"This movie indicates that Charles Bronson just doesn't care any more, and is just going through the motions for the money. I admired his strong, simple talent once. What is he doing in a garbage disposal like this?"
2581,winters-bone-movie,Amy Biancolli,100,"This is one helluva drama, with one helluva star turn by Jennifer Lawrence as Ree."
2582,the-surrogate-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"The Sessions is moving. At times, it's even erotic, which is unexpected, to say the least. It sends viewers out of the theater with a heightened sense of the physical and a real feeling for all the things that sex means in human life."
2583,flubber-movie,Keith Phipps,10,"Like everything else in this needless remake—from a heartless performance by Williams to the patented kiddie-sadism of screenwriter John Hughes—it's sloppily grafted onto a skeletal version of the original, with scenes lifted from the source and reinserted in a manner that doesn't make sense."
2584,hush-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,"When you watch this failed horror thriller -- which has been under studio doctors' care for some two years, undergoing futile title changes and reshoots -- there's no respite from the odor of flop sweat stinking up the screen."
2585,bloody-sunday-movie,Steven Rea,100,"A bracing, unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale."
2586,its-a-wonderful-life-movie,Rich Cohen,100,"I don’t care what your parents told you. It’s a Wonderful Life, that reassuring holiday spectacle, is really the most terrifying Hollywood film ever made. It’s one of a handful of masterpieces directed by Frank Capra, an Italian immigrant who loved America because America saved him."
2587,last-vegas-movie,Abhimanyu Das,12,"The film is depressing, sub-sitcom fodder that will dull whatever affection you may still harbor for these legendary actors."
2588,tom-at-the-farm-movie,Rex Reed,75,"Don’t miss Tom at the Farm, the latest controversy in the oeuvre of acclaimed French-Canadian actor-writer-director Xavier Dolan, who has been labeled the “enfant terrible of queer cinema.” "
2589,biutiful-movie,Wesley Morris,63,The movie wails in pain. And it's that sort of grand empathy that makes Iñárritu both impossible to dismiss and impossible to live with. 
2590,love-the-coopers-movie,Stephen Whitty ,20,"Got your holiday turkey yet? Well, don't worry, Diane Keaton and John Goodman have one waiting for you at the movie theater."
2591,eighth-grade-movie,Peter Travers,100,"Bo Burnham’s story about a 14-year-old misfit is one of the funniest, saddest and most heartfelt teen movies ever."
2592,tape-movie,David Edelstein,80,"No wonder Hawke was so hot to pass the script onto Linklater. He's superb, by the way."
2593,the-women-movie,Philip Kennicott,30,Falls flat at every turn.
2594,black-panther-movie,Brian Truitt,100,"While the themes are deep, Black Panther is at the same time a visual joy to behold, with confident quirkiness (those aforementioned war rhinos), insane action sequences and special effects, and the glorious reveal of Wakanda, whose culture is steeped in African influences but which also offers a jaw-dropping look at what a city of the future could be."
2595,tideland-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"Dour, absurdist, gruesomely awful."
2596,mr-turner-movie,Eric Kohn,91,Mr. Turner is a first-rate match of director and subject. Less an explication of the man's genius than an immersion into its essence.
2597,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,Ella Taylor,0,A schizoid monster slapped together by uneasy bedfellows.
2598,iq-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"Don't let your brain interfere with your heart, says Albert Einstein -- yes, that Albert Einstein -- in I.Q., neatly summing up the message of this sprightly romantic comedy. It's a movie with an inventive premise that works better than you'd think. [24 Dec 1994, p.J3]"
2599,the-sea-inside-movie,Steven Rea,75,"For the most part, the film stays steady-on, celebrating one man's crusade - and one family's heartbreak."

2601,untitled-3d-shark-thriller-movie,Roger Moore,25,"The worst movie of the summer, arriving on the last weekend of the summer."
2602,tyler-perrys-a-madea-christmas-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,A Madea Christmas belongs to a rancid strain of Yuletide trifles that feature awful people being terrible to each other for 90 minutes under the sway of insulting plot contrivances before the awfulness is climactically washed away in an avalanche of holiday sentimentality.
2603,ordinary-people-movie,Jack Kroll,90,"If the film has a problem, it's a kind of excess of goodness at the expense of imaginative excitement. The real hero is the psychiatrist, played with a riffing Jewish beat by Hirsch as a counterpoint to the tight Wasp rhythms of Conrad's family. There's a feeling of therapy more than revelation, but perhaps for our multifariously sick society therapy has become revelation. This seems to have been a major point in Guest's novel, and Redford has dramatized it with integrity, honor and compassion. [22 Sept 1980, p.76]"
2604,the-change-up-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Let's give this ghastly studio comedy a Truthiness in Advertising award, if nothing else."
2605,deja-vu-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"After 9/11, few of us look at terrorist acts casually. It's insulting to watch this grandiloquent pornography, using shock value and Hollywood cliche to evoke poignancy."
2606,the-last-boy-scout-movie,Desson Thomson,37,"It's a kill movie, the filmic equivalent of a hate crime. "
2607,haywire-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,85,That she makes it all look so effortless is part of the fun – as long as you're not unlucky enough to be the guy with his nut in the nutcracker.
2608,horns-movie,Rodrigo Perez,16,"When Horns thankfully concludes, relief sets in; this hellishly misguided effort concludes with an inferno and sequels are never sprung from the equivalent of a mouthful of ash."
2609,florence-foster-jenkins-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,88,"In this charming and delightful biopic that bears her name, the matronly Jenkins is an endearing and courageous stand-in for countless other mortals whose aspirations in the arts often far exceed their talents."
2610,the-marc-pease-experience-movie,David Hiltbrand,38,"Faced with the script's weak humor and feeble stabs at irony, Schwartzman and Stiller turn it way up, setting the dial at ""hammy."""
2611,clean-movie,V.A. Musetto,75,"Cheung and Nick Nolte seem unlikely co-stars, but co-star they do in Clean, giving gritty performances under the direction of Frenchman Olivier Assayas."
2612,irreversible-movie,David Edelstein,20,"The 12 scenes of Irreversible--each shot in a single, semi-improvised take--constitute something of a tour de force. But so would being dragged through the streets by a wire noose."
2613,black-swan-movie,Steven Rea,100,"Wild and woolly, the movie is a breathtaking head trip that hails from a long tradition of backstage melodramas: ""42nd Street,"" ""A Star Is Born,"" ""All About Eve,"" and, yes, that kitschy '90s relic, ""Showgirls."" "
2614,crossing-over-movie,Kenneth Turan,10,"Forced, heavy-handed and overdone, it's a pretend serious film that offers crass manipulation in the place where honesty is supposed to be."
2615,star-wars-episode-i---the-phantom-menace-movie,David Sterritt,75,"The computer-driven effects are impressive, but the adventure is hampered by a flat screenplay, dull acting, and just a hint as to why the dark side of the Force will eventually transform cute little Anakin into the evil Darth Vader."
2616,we-were-soldiers-movie,Jay Carr,75,It isn't afraid to genuflect to heroes and heroism and has everything it needs to connect with the resurgence of patriotism after Sept. 11.
2617,moonrise-kingdom-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"First-time Anderson performers such as Willis, McDormand and especially Norton fold effortlessly into the melancholy end-of-summer vibe. "
2618,failure-to-launch-movie,Stephen Hunter,80,The movie is one of the best American films in months and months and the best comedy since I don't know when. It even makes you sorta kinda like Matthew McConaughey.
2619,i-love-you-to-death-movie,Staff (Not Credited),10,I Love You to Death is a stillborn attempt at black comedy.
2620,sherlock-gnomes-movie,Richard Whittaker,0,"Remember the eyeball-scrapingly unfunny ""Gnomeo and Juliet""? Remember watching it and thinking, “Really? It’s 2011, and we’re still doing Borat mankini jokes?” Well, welcome to Sherlock Gnomes, a sequel seven years past its sell-by date, and 12 years after Sacha Baron Cohen made audiences cringe at his swimsuit choices."
2621,the-fault-in-our-stars-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"The acting is top-notch, the characters are three-dimensional, and the dialogue is sharp and witty."
2622,the-double-2013-movie,Diane Garrett,20,"Without a character to really care about, the movie just comes off as fraught and over-stylized."
2623,chicago-movie,Frank Scheck,90,"Marshall, a veteran stage director/choreographer who proved his cinematic skills with his television adaptations of the musicals Cinderella and Annie, does a superb job here, beautifully contrasting the gritty storyline with the hard-edged musical numbers."
2624,the-relic-movie,Stephen Holden,80,"Yes, we've seen it all before. But The Relic proves that the hoariest cliches, when stirred together with enough money, shaken vigorously and artfully lighted, can still make the adrenaline surge."
2625,reindeer-games-movie,Gemma Files,30,"About an hour after you've seen it, you'll already be fuzzy on just who was screwing who, and why"
2626,executive-decision-movie,Desson Thomson,70,"If you're looking for satisfying junk food, Executive Decision is exactly the carryout you've been craving. This hijacking suspense drama steals shamelessly from Tom Clancy's kitchen, but it's tautly scripted, loaded with tension and interspersed with great comic relief. "
2627,go-movie,Richard Corliss,80,"Here is a picture that has wit, a hairpin-turn narrative, high pizazz and ensemble star quality. Ready, set, Go."
2628,chicken-little-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"Bogged down by many of the problems that have plagued Disney's recent traditional animated features: anonymous voice work, poor plot structure, and the mistaken belief that the Disney brand will elevate anything to a ""must see"" level for viewers starved for family friendly fare. If there's a bright side to Chicken Little, it's that kids will love it."
2629,big-sur-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,75,"Big Sur rises and fades, shifts and moves, through movements and melodies, singing a beautifully sad song for an era and a man who lost his way."
2630,semipro-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,70,"Semi-Pro finds the sweet spot between sports melodrama and parody, and hammers it for 90 diverting minutes."
2631,the-last-house-on-the-left-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,This remake is merely vile (and dull).
2632,whipped-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"I was consistently aghast at how unabashedly alpha-male, heartless, and chauvinistic this film is."
2633,the-rules-of-attraction-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,20,Ugh. The Rules of Attraction is the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste.
2634,death-of-a-nation-movie,Frank Scheck,0,"For all of its incendiary arguments, Death of a Nation is ultimately tedious and repetitive. No one expects, of course, that D'Souza would make a thoughtful, balanced or historically accurate documentary. But is it unreasonable to hope that he make one that doesn't bore the pants off us?"
2635,legendary-movie,David Fear,20,"The only thing that remains a mystery is why anyone thinks they can pass off a poorly made, predictable-to-a-fault movie as inspiring entertainment."
2636,orphan-movie,Ann Hornaday,0,"Depraved, worthless piece of filth."
2637,interview-movie,Carina Chocano,70,"For a film that unfolds mostly in a single location, Interview manages not to feel like a stage piece. But the premise, which may have worked in Holland, gets a little lost in the American translation."
2638,the-importance-of-being-earnest-movie,Stephen Holden,70,"For all its distractions and additions, The Importance of Being Earnest is still a reasonably entertaining costume comedy. Wilde's satirical voice may be muffled, but at least it is audible."
2639,timeline-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,Timeline has negative energy to burn. There's even less of it by the end than at the beginning.
2640,down-to-earth-movie,Peter Rainer,20,"If Rock ever comes to his senses, he can host Saturday Night Live and skewer this damp, gag-riddled civics lesson of a movie."
2641,the-boy-next-door-movie,David Hiltbrand,25,"The Boy Next Door aspires to be a cautionary tale, but it unspools like an infomercial - with a shockingly gory ending."

2643,the-quick-and-the-dead-movie,Amy Gamerman,10,"Ms. Stone. She alternates between two expressions here: sullen, and aghast. Then again, if you were listed on the credits as the co-producer of this violently dull piece of shlock, you'd look that way, too. [16 Feb 1995, p.A12]"
2644,the-mighty-macs-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,12,"The Mighty Macs is a film from another planet, where stories are told, obliviously, in cryptic, nonsensical code, and people talk to each other in sugarplum proverbs no earthbound adult would ever inflict on another, not even on the set of a Hallmark Original Movie."
2645,fast-five-movie,Drew Taylor,75,"What’s interesting is watching the way that Lin has to maneuver in and out of the limitations that the franchise has established, while attempting to push it into new territory."
2646,mchales-navy-movie,Liam Lacey,0,"Not funny, suspenseful, moving or even offensive enough to want to torpedo. Just devoid of any conceivable value. [19 Apr 1997, p.C13]"

2649,madeas-big-happy-family-movie,Nathan Rabin,33,"Everything is pitched to jarring emotional extremes of good and evil, joy and pain, chitlin'-circuit broad comedy, and melodramatic speeches. "
2650,dead-man-down-movie,Nick Schager,30,"It's all so much turgid brooding, dialogue underlined with import, and leaden symbolism involving Rapace's white and red dresses, none of which is salvaged by a typically understated Farrell performance."
2651,zero-dark-thirty-movie,Lawrence Toppman,88,"Zero Dark Thirty, like the mission that inspired it, commands respect, admiration, even awe in places for the logistical nightmares that had to be overcome to get it done. But it's a hard movie to love."
2652,the-adventures-of-sharkboy-and-lavagirl-3-d-movie,Ruthe Stein,25,"Sharkboy relies almost entirely on 3-D for its kicks. The novelty, however, quickly wears thin with the thinnest of stories to project."
2653,sketches-of-frank-gehry-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"The result is not a formal doc but an extended chat between two professionals who, as Pollack puts it, search for ""a sliver of space in the commercial world where you can make a difference."""
2654,oceans-8-movie,Kimber Myers,83,"Ocean’s 8 is the self-aware frosé of movies; a summer delight, perfectly airy and refreshing, it’s not here to be your cinematic think piece. Ocean’s 8 knows exactly what it’s doing and what it’s trying to achive– showing the audience hell of a good time – and it succeeds marvelously at it, without leaving the audience feeling duped."
2655,the-prince-and-me-movie,Nathan Rabin,30,"Few actresses exude restless intelligence as effortlessly as Stiles, which is fortunate, since Martha Coolidge's film relies on that forceful charisma to make it past awful dialogue, contrived situations, and hokey use of Disney-style butterflies. "
2656,to-be-or-not-to-be-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,"To Be or Not to Be, co-starring Carole Lombard and Jack Benny, under expert guidance of Ernst Lubitsch, is absorbing drama with farcical trimmings. It's an acting triumph for Lombard, who delivers an effortless and highly effective performance that provides memorable finale to her brilliant screen career."
2657,the-corporation-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"It’s coolheaded and incisive, a thorough and informative study of corporations, their origins and their place in the modern world."
2658,bread-and-tulips-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"It's an endearing romantic daydream, but misses the bus where matters of reality are concerned."
2659,american-pie-2-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,Lacks both taste and flavor.
2660,i-dont-know-how-she-does-it-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,12,"Insipid, unfunny and cliche-ridden."
2661,the-flintstones-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"Leadenly directed and almost soberly scripted, it never captures the campy brightness of the original series -- the herky-jerky animation, the wacky sound effects, the distinctive character voices and that cheesy laugh track."
2662,the-aviator-movie,Robert Wilonsky,70,A fun and loving biopic
2663,saturn-3-movie,Staff (Not Credited),10,"Douglas is sprightly, but he has to handle some pretty awful lines in this Martin Amis script [from a story by John Barry]. Keitel’s dialog, if quoted, would be on a par."
2664,dreamcatcher-movie,David Denby,10,"In the end, Dreamcatcher is an abominable-worm picture. The movie is also an unholy mess, a miserably organized and redundant collection of arbitrary scares and thrills without a unifying visual or poetic idea.  [31 March 2003, p. 106]"
2665,the-foot-fist-way-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"Staggers and wanders and feels far longer than its 85 minutes, and it's best considered a calling card for better things to come."
2666,the-time-machine-movie,Chris Gore,10,I’m getting fed up with classic films being remade or ruined by being turned into “Special Editions” that are less than special.
2667,the-golden-child-movie,Dave Kehr,25,"A weirdly out-of-scale movie that constantly juxtaposes the trivial and the cosmic, less to comic effect than to a mounting sense of muddle and uncertainty."
2668,reds-movie,Michael Sragow,100,"Not since Lawrence of Arabia has there been a serious historical movie of this sweep, complexity and intelligence."
2669,evita-movie,Mike Clark,63,"So fluidly visual that only a deathbed finale can flag its pace, it's the first Panavision music video to run 21/4 hours, the monotony finally sapping its staying power. [23 Dec 1996 Pg.01.D]"
2670,a-walk-to-remember-movie,Lawrence Toppman,25,"Self-respecting filmgoers will find this a ""Walk"" to dismember."
2671,nebraska-movie,Scott Foundas,100,"Throughout, Payne gently infuses the film’s comic tone with strains of longing and regret, always careful to avoid the maudlin or cheaply sentimental."
2672,villa-capri-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"Abysmal, unfunny, and ultimately, completely unnecessary."
2673,may-movie,Scott Tobias,70,"May represents something rare and unfashionable-–a smart, twisted little slasher comedy that doesn't skimp on the gore."
2674,ghost-dog-the-way-of-the-samurai-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,It's the kind of movie you wish you had more time to absorb and could see more than once before reviewing.
2675,louder-than-words-movie,Steve Erickson,30,"Louder Than Words obviously means well, but its brand of cheap uplift is the kind of cheese that actually breeds cynicism."
2676,inappropriate-comedy-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,12,"A more accurate title would be “Inept, Inadequate and Insipid Comedy.”"
2677,the-whistleblower-movie,Mary Pols,80,"Weisz is a dazzling woman, but her beauty is barely noticeable in this role; her character's integrity and her mounting anger grab all the attention. In one scene Kathy finally confronts what she's up against and starts to cry. They are tears of rage, and the most powerful I've seen this year."
2678,you-instead-movie,Peter Bradshaw,20,"A jaw-droppingly self-indulgent, shallow, smug if mercifully brief feature with a plot that looks like the outline for a pop video."
2679,oceans-thirteen-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"Ocean's Thirteen proceeds with insouciant dialogue, studied casualness, and a lotta stuff happening, none of which I cared much about because the movie doesn't pause to develop the characters, who are forced to make do with their movie-star personas."
2680,paul-blart-mall-cop-movie,Wesley Morris,12,Looks like something stubbed out in an ashtray.
2681,gun-shy-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,0,"A half hour in and still, the plot, tone, and setting are incomprehensible."
2682,the-maltese-falcon-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"With Hammett's dialogue incorporated virtually verbatim into the screenplay, Bogart in top form, and Huston allowed total directorial freedom, watching this first of the films noir is an experience to be embraced. "
2683,the-eagle-huntress-movie,Kate Erbland,83,"A soaring, sweet documentary that welcomes its audience into an unexpected new arena, The Eagle Huntress offers up a movie-perfect story with a leading lady who has something to share with everyone."
2684,phantoms-movie,Michael Wilmington,12,"Phantoms may have sold like hotcakes as a book. But this movie version is a grotesque fiasco, a confoundingly senseless story told with unexciting visuals, cliched dialogue and ear-bashing sounds... Watching it is a truly hellish experience.  [23 Jan 1998]"
2685,zoolander-2-movie,Stephen Holden,30,Zoolander 2 has enough plots for several movies. They are so jammed together that they more or less cancel each other out.
2686,eight-crazy-nights-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,An appallingly tedious Hanukkah comedy that must have bubbled up from the Porta Potti of his subconscious.
2687,a-most-violent-year-movie,Kimberley Jones,89,"A Most Violent Year is its own thing, hypnotic and exacting and as subtly savage as mellow-voiced Marvin Gaye’s “Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler),” which opens the film and sets the tone. I was fully in thrall to it all."
2688,to-live-and-die-in-la-movie,Jay Scott,88,"To Live and Die in L.A., for all its amorality and downright immorality, is a cracker-jack thriller, tense and exciting and unpredictable, and more grimy fun than any moralist will want it to be. It has big hit written all over it: the premise, Miami Vice Meets The French Connection, may be perverse, but it's also inspired. [1 Nov 1985]"
2689,i-am-sam-movie,Robert Koehler,10,An especially insipid example of the Hollywood message movie.
2690,green-lantern-movie,Wesley Morris,25,The film is remarkably stunted.

2692,rosewater-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"I must say I felt relieved that the film wasn’t a masterpiece. If it was, we’d have more reason to fear Stewart will leave ""The Daily Show.” "
2693,jimmy-p-movie,Keith Uhlich,80,"Del Toro and Amalric’s concentrated performances — the former resigned and shell-shocked, the latter agitated and servile — have an anguished grandeur. "
2694,the-east-movie,Peter Travers,75,"You leave The East with a hunger to know more and a good idea of where to look. For Marling and Batmanglij that counts as mission accomplished. For audiences, it’s that rare thing these days – a movie that matters."
2695,shrek-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,The first of this summer's would-be blockbusters that deserves to be a hit.
2696,nina-movie,Odie Henderson,0,You’ll see some durable makeup in Nina. What you won’t see is any justification why this film should exist.
2697,dont-think-twice-movie,Sheila O'Malley,88,"So spot-on in its evocation of that whole ""scene,"" onstage and off — its intimacy, competition, struggles and rhythms — that at times it feels like a documentary."
2698,philip-roth-unmasked-movie,Ela Bittencourt,63,"In spite of the film's exhaustive chronology, those who deduce from its title that they're in for an unveiling, or an unraveling, of a major literary figure may come out empty-handed."
2699,the-wedding-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"“I’d rather gouge my eyes out with hot spoons!’’ De Niro exclaims at one point. I’m not sure exactly what he was talking about, but I’d like to think it referred to the prospect of being forced to watch The Big Wedding."
2700,rollerball-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"Remarkably empty, remarkably noisy, remarkably pleasureless. It's unwatchable."
2701,wreck-it-ralph-movie,Peter Debruge,100,"With plenty to appeal to boys and girls, old and young, Walt Disney Animation Studios has a high-scoring hit on its hands in this brilliantly conceived, gorgeously executed toon, earning bonus points for backing nostalgia with genuine emotion."
2702,best-of-enemies-movie,Rob Kemp,83,Best of Enemies succeeds on utilitarian terms: it does what it’s supposed to. 
2703,strayed-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"A picture-book French film that's pretty and trite, rather than edgy and moving. "
2704,transformers-age-of-extinction-movie,Richard Corliss,30,"Nothing coheres. Movies usually try to come together at the end; this one falls apart. If that's Bay intention, then cinema has finally entered its Age of Extinction. "
2705,wonderland-movie,Scott Warren,38,"The filmmakers may have wanted to deconstruct any sense of a formal, cohesive narrative; instead, they have merely demolished it."
2706,the-secret-in-their-eyes-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,At times you may be moved as by no other foreign film this year - and then 10 minutes later be leaning forward in the seat just to stay awake.
2707,the-blair-witch-project-movie,Shawn Levy,91,It breaks so sharply from the practice of contemporary horror film that it requires us to return to the most basic understanding of what it is to be frightened by a movie.
2708,resident-evil-apocalypse-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"An utterly meaningless waste of time...It is a dead zone, a film without interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and special effects."
2709,the-man-movie,Connie Ogle,0,"It's just awful. Pointless, lazy, derivative and paralyzingly dull."
2710,capote-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,What Mr. Hoffman has done here borders on the miraculous.

2713,the-darkness-movie,Roger Moore,38,"The scariest thing about The Darkness turns out to be the trailers to this summer’s more promising horror offerings, “Lights Out” and “Don’t Breathe.”"
2714,a-bronx-tale-movie,Desson Howe,70,"The story is riddled with absurd coincidences and improbabilities. It doesn't have an original bone in its body. And no one's going to leave this film thinking De Niro should stay behind the camera. But none of these problems stops the movie from being enjoyable. If Bronx Tale feels too familiar, it's at least the familiarity of good Italian movies."
2715,rachel-getting-married-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,"As Kym, Hathaway runs an astonishing gamut of emotions, from anger to fragility and from hurt to regret - without ever seeming actress-y, like Nicole Kidman. Start clearing that mantelpiece, Anne."
2716,blackkklansman-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"BlacKkKlansman comes across as equally entertaining and disturbing, which is most likely what Lee intended. "
2717,diamond-cartel-movie,Gary Goldstein,10,The largely Russian- and Kazakh-speaking cast is so incongruously dubbed into English it evokes an old Japanese monster movie.

2719,barbershop-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"Why, in our drum-thumping, ritually trumpeting time, did so little fanfare precede the opening of a movie with so much to recommend it? This is grand entertainment."
2720,the-second-mother-movie,Lucy Popescu,100,"This brilliant, beautifully observed comedy is a joy to watch throughout. The Second Mother's narrative works on so many levels, reflected in the film's ambiguous title, and the characterisation is flawless."
2721,the-circle-movie,Peter Rainer,70,"In The Circle, which is banned in Iran, the enforced society of women is, in effect, a community of adults treated as children."
2722,a-prophet-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"Long and sometimes grueling, but it never feels indulgent or excessive.  In order to be subtle about the horrifying transformation he records, Audiard needs to let it unfold slowly, so that only when we reach the end can we see Malik as a new man who has come unimaginably -- and terribly -- far."
2723,the-emoji-movie-movie,Jordan Hoffman,0,The only thing worse than the dialogue is the absurd product placement.

2726,dogville-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"A symphony for tin ears, a sniggering assessment of human nature delivered with the faux-lofty tone of a Lexus commercial. "
2727,trouble-the-water-movie,J.R. Jones,100,"It's a damning indictment of a national disgrace, but it also reveals the incredible faith and resilience of people who have nothing to rely on but themselves."

2730,of-men-and-mavericks-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,20,"As it turns out, the only truly interesting element about this clichéd surfer flick is that it was made by celebrated directors Michael Apted and Curtis Hanson."
2731,the-women-movie,Ella Taylor,20,Isn't so much incompetent as it is hopelessly tame and muddled.
2732,atonement-movie,Lawrence Toppman,100,"The result is a film that has ""Masterpiece Theatre"" production values but not an ounce of dust upon it."
2733,cutie-and-the-boxer-movie,Walter Addiego,75,"This elegant movie never reduces or diminishes its subjects, and leaves us to ponder a remarkable truth - that Ushio and Noriko have an abiding love that four decades of frustration, resentment and rivalry have battered but not extinguished. "
2734,the-adventures-of-rocky-bullwinkle-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,A whole lot of something about nothing.
2735,88minutes-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"88 Minutes holds you in a state of acute suspense, keeping you wondering until the very last minute whether this is the worst Al Pacino movie ever made."
2736,american-pie-2-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,20,"Of all the characters in American Pie 2, male or female, Michelle is the only one who feels completely rounded and whole. She moves with unerring grace and subtlety through this feeble minefield of a movie, unharmed by the tepid jokes that flop and fizzle around her."
2737,paddington-movie,Brad Wheeler,88,"This is not only a dandy, playful movie about a talking bear, but one that gives pause for thought, too."
2738,doctor-strange-movie,Brian Truitt,75,"Derrickson (Sinister) crafts a trippy phantasmagoria for Strange to fly screaming through as he begins his path to sorcerer supreme. The only thing missing is a Doors jam as the sequence unfolds a dizzying blend of psychedelia, geometric oddities and nightmarish dreamscapes."
2739,one-true-thing-movie,Stephen Holden,70,"Bluntly, poignantly believable. "
2740,intolerable-cruelty-movie,Megan Lehmann,88,"Hilariously overblown, ""Cruelty"" fairly pops at the seams with the beloved eccentricity of Joel and Ethan Coen, from the fiendishly ludicrous scenarios and casually tossed off visual gags to the razor-sharp repartee. "
2741,risk-movie,Richard Roeper,88,Risk is filled with dramatic scenes straight out of a spy thriller.
2742,young-beautiful-movie,Ian Freer,80,Another typically assured piece of work from Ozon with a showstopping turn from newcomer Vacth.
2743,rabbit-hole-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Entertaining and surprisingly amusing, under the circumstances. The film is in a better state of mind than its characters. Its humor comes, as the best humor does, from an acute observation of human nature."
2744,trixie-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"The whole movie is like that: cute, dead and endless."
2745,freedom-writers-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"If you've seen ""To Sir, With Love,"" ""Dead Poet's Society,"" ""The Corn is Green,"" or ""Stand and Deliver"" - to take a random sample - you've already seen much of this movie. Swank is good, though, and so is Patrick Dempsey as her suffering husband."
2746,pride-2014-movie,Stephen Holden,90,"It is the kind of hearty, blunt-force drama with softened edges that leaves audiences applauding and teary-eyed."
2747,xxx-movie,Michael Sragow,38,"The movie's own style is strictly an anti-style, all pre-packaged post-punk."
2748,must-love-dogs-movie,Claudia Puig,75,"A breath of fresh air amid the superheroes, aliens and bombastic explosions of summer."
2749,rust-bone-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"Jacques Audiard's Rust and Bone is an unapologetic melodrama rendered in what you might call semi-stylized neo-expressionistic realism, and it works like gangbusters."
2750,the-lazarus-effect-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"There’s no doubt at all that the schlocky The Lazarus Effect should have been euthanized and shipped directly to video rather than haunting movie theaters, however briefly."
2751,tooth-fairy-movie,Scott Tobias,10,"The only apparent reason Tooth Fairy exists at all is to squeeze tough-guy ex-wrestler Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson into tights and a tutu. As comic ideas go, that doesn't stretch much further than the poster."
2752,big-mommas-house-movie,J. Rentilly,15,"A frenetic, aggressively unfunny one-joke merging of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Tootsie."""
2753,the-campaign-2012-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,"Instead of biting wit, though, the movie settles for sketch humor, standard-brand raunch and toothless slapstick that trivializes everything it touches."
2754,the-forest-movie,Bill Zwecker,75,"With a nice, unexpected twist at the end, The Forest delivers as a healthy dose of psychological cinematic terror and an impressive first feature directing effort."
2755,dracula-2000-movie,Stephen Holden,0,It's a little sad to see actors of the quality of Christopher Plummer and Jonny Lee Miller struggling straight- faced to dignify this sewage.
2756,let-the-right-one-in-movie,John Anderson,100,"In the basest of terms, a horror flick. But it's also a spectacularly moving and elegant movie, and to dismiss it into genre-hood, to mentally stuff it into the horror pigeonhole, is to overlook a remarkable film."
2757,kangaroo-jack-movie,Liam Lacey,25,"In the life-is-too-short category, file Kangaroo Jack as a sub-Farrelly Brothers, dumb-plus-dumber buddy picture."
2758,three-times-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"Three Times is great cinema, pop romance that carries a special charge."
2759,monster-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"A compelling, thought-provoking, and unsettling drama."
2760,the-perfect-holiday-movie,Kyle Smith,25,Most of the comedy comes from dull situations like a fat guy trying to put on a fat suit for no reason.
2761,full-metal-jacket-movie,Sheila Benson,90,"In a superb cast of mostly unknowns -- with the exception of Matthew Modine and Dorain Harewood -- D'Onofrio, who put on 60 pounds for this pivotal role, and Ermey are exceptional. [26 June 1987]"
2762,kitchen-stories-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,70,"The humor is a bit dry for my taste, but director Bent Hamer and his actors know what they're doing every step of the way."
2763,monsters-university-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"A charming, family friendly endeavor and, although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney, it's nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids. "
2764,norm-of-the-north-movie,Bilge Ebiri,10,Everything appears to have been thrown together with little attention paid to how it might all work together.
2765,the-rachel-divide-movie,Roger Moore,75,"If you’ve made up your mind about her, it’s hard to see this intriguing documentary changing that made up mind. The movie turned my head, here and there. But the questions about her honesty linger, along with the notoriety."
2766,the-x-files-i-want-to-believe-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"They've become deadly dull, these two once-keen buckers of bureaucratic BS, and watching them interact on screen is akin to having your pleasure centers removed by knobby little aliens whose only knowledge of mankind comes from Jack Webb's stoically unvarying television incarnations."
2767,the-million-dollar-hotel-movie,Charles Taylor,10,"There's a vacancy in The Million Dollar Hotel, and it's between Wim Wenders' ears."
2768,rapturepalooza-movie,Nathan Rabin,30,The film overflows with inspired comic ideas that fizzle and die in execution like a marathon fireworks display of nothing but duds.

2770,x-movie,Paul Malcolm,90,It's all such a spectacular show.
2771,a-perfect-world-movie,Chris Cabin,75,"Hancock lays the groundwork for Eastwood to transform what might have been an admirable, tightly told entertainment into something far more emotionally resonant, slyly self-aware, and rich in subtext."
2772,a-lot-like-love-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,It starts with a bang and ends with a whimper.
2773,filth-and-wisdom-movie,Anthony Lane,10,"Madonna's mess of a movie grabs at the rub and rancor of multiculturalism, which it proceeds to squash into a litter of clichés, or, more simply, insults."
2774,stoned-movie,Joel Selvin,25,Almost so bad it's good. Almost.
2775,still-mine-movie,Rex Reed,88,"Not since ""The Straight Story,"" when Richard Farnsworth traveled all the way from Iowa to Wisconsin by lawn mower to see his dying brother, have the wisdom, innocence and pride of a senior citizen combined so powerfully as a metaphor for the courage to face mortality. Unforgettable."
2776,teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movie,Simon Abrams,38,"If nothing else, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reminds us that nostalgia is often used as a mandate for spectacularly lazy filmmaking. "
2777,blade-runner-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,88,"What remains is a great Vangelis score, astonishing production design, Hauer's career role -- and a movie that deserves its cult reputation despite an unloving heart. [11 Sept 1992]"
2778,the-bitter-pill-movie,David Edelstein,80,"Soderbergh’s alleged last theatrical film is paranoid and hopeless, but he leaves the field with a bounce in his step."
2779,the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn---part-1-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,25,"Intended as the cinematic equivalent of an orgasm, this tirelessly hyped insta-blockbuster is loaded with OMG developments (marriage! Sex! Baby!) and seemingly regarded by everyone to include the most epic and gratifying scenes of romantic release in modern movie history."
2780,the-chateau-movie,Kevin Thomas,70,"Delightfully bittersweet culture-clash comedy. If what's funny is frequently hilarious, then what's nasty truly stings, and the film is honest enough not to tie up everything with a ribbon."
2781,the-cannonball-run-movie,Staff (Not Credited),30,"With a plot stolen from THE GUMBALL RALLY (1976) and CANNONBALL (1976), this wholly derivative car-chase movie provides a flimsy excuse for good ol' boy Burt Reynolds to cavort on-screen with a cast that's chock-full of familiar faces."
2782,silent-hill-movie,Owen Gleiberman,33,"A few of the images are startling, but as Radha Mitchell (a good actress) wanders through a ghost town, searching for her lost daughter as though she was touring an abandoned movie set, Silent Hill is mostly paralyzing in its vagueness."
2783,ithaca-movie,Keith Watson,12,"The film is confused in conception, dreary in execution, and completely lacking in forward momentum."
2784,on-body-and-soul-movie,Roger Moore,75,On Body and Soul isn’t as linear in its storytelling style or as results-oriented in its plot as a Hollywood or Western European film wrestling with these themes might be. That’s why the foreign language Oscar category is so valuable. It insists that viewers at least take a shot at seeing the world through another culture’s eyes via challenging films.
2785,wish-upon-movie,Eric Kohn,16,"Fortunately, you don’t need to wish for better versions of the movie experience Wish Upon calls to mind; they exist, and deserve repeat viewings far more than Wish Upon deserves one."
2786,london-has-fallen-movie,Peter Sobczynski,12,A horrible and wildly unnecessary follow-up that might actually be worse than its predecessor.
2787,your-highness-movie,Pete Hammond,10,So thuddingly awful you won't crack a smile.
2788,wadjda-movie,Farran Smith Nehme,88,What makes the movie so delightful is that Wadjda isn’t trying to make trouble; she’s just being herself. A shot of the system of wire hangers attached to her radio so she can pick up Western music stations sums up her can-do attitude.
2789,little-shop-of-horrors-movie,Michael Wilmington,90,"A lot of this horrific Little Shop is not only sweet, melodic, funny and oddly idealistic, it's even, well, tasty. [19 Dec 1986, p.1]"
2790,black-snake-moan-movie,Scott Foundas,30,"Black Snake Moan is, at its core, a fairly straightforward variation on George Bernard Shaw -- ""Pigsfeetmalion,"" if you will. One day, when he outgrows his terminal adolescence, Brewer might be the perfect filmmaker to tackle Faulkner or Tennessee Williams."
2791,ready-to-rumble-movie,Tom Keogh,10,I would rather have been scraping gum off my shoe than sitting there another minute.
2792,sur-mes-levres-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"Not a heist film, a thriller, a twisted romance, a film noir or a character study, but a unique concoction that bends all these genres to its vision."
2793,jumpin-jack-flash-movie,Bill Cosford,63,"Penny Marshall proves deft at blending the silly stuff with enough action to generate a bit of suspense; the mix is that of Beverly Hills Cop. And the script, though the work of a whole crowd -- almost always a bad sign -- has marvelous moments. [10 Oct 1986, p.D1]"
2794,right-now-wrong-then-movie,James Lattimer,88,Spotting and processing the countless differences between the parts offers pleasures on various levels. 
2795,mystic-river-movie,William Arnold,100,"Moves along its course and overflows at its climax with that indefinable but unmistakable assurance of a master filmmaker who knows just what he wants to say, is in total command of his medium and is in no mood to make any compromises."
2796,the-hangover-part-iii-movie,Joe Williams,38,The good news is that Ed Helms doesn’t wake up in a Tijuana brothel with an amputated leg and a donkey in the room. The bad news is that you’ll wish he had.
2797,true-crime-movie,David Sterritt,75,"It would be even better if Eastwood followed his character's lead and emphasized ""real issues"" over ""human interest"" in a story that touches on important social problems without doing much to illuminate them. "
2798,the-legend-of-hercules-movie,Kenji Fujishima,38,"Given its virtuous subject matter and the relative bloodlessness of its violence, perhaps Renny Harlin means for this film to be a means of atoning for his previous cinematic sins."
2799,josie-and-the-pussycats-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,An antiadvertisement for itself.
2800,thomas-and-the-magic-railroad-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"A big, fat clunker."
2801,upside-down-movie,Tasha Robinson,16,"Moment for moment, Upside Down is the most embarrassing, hilarious, obliviously stupid movie since M. Night Shyamalan’s ""The Happening,"" and its constant pursuit of a striking image over any other consideration undermines it at every turn."
2802,short-cuts-movie,Edward Guthmann,75,"It's compelling, emotionally exhausting terrain, and Altman delivers it in cold, blunt strokes. [22 Oct 1993]"
2803,ballistic-ecks-vs-sever-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,Movies don't get much worse.
2804,the-rider-movie,K. Austin Collins,90,"Despite its pure beauty, in other words, there’s no mistaking The Rider for a simple, crowd-pleasing pick-me-up. The movie is soulful, elegant, filmed as often as not at the magic hour, when the sky is as broad as it is orange-yellow, and every nook of the world seems alight with possibility. It is hardly, on its surface, an outright downer. But it’s unmistakably a movie about loss."
2805,friday-after-next-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"Marginally better than its predecessor, but only because ""Next Friday"" lowered standards so far that only a homemade cockfighting video would have failed to surpass it."
2806,the-ritual-movie,Roger Moore,25,"A British eOne/Netflix production, packs a bunch of boy-bonding lads off into the wilds of Sweden. No “found footage,” but it’s “The Borgholm Witch Project” in the Swedish “Cabin in the Woods,” “Wicker Man,” the works."
2807,spartan-movie,Ty Burr,75,"When Spartan is good, it's surprisingly gripping and fresh, and when it's bad, it's just another overcooked Hollywood paranoid thriller. "
2808,bucky-larson-born-to-be-a-star-movie,Robert Abele,20,"The scenario makes for an inept, lazy R-rated movie whose sole purpose is as a glossary of euphemisms for genitalia and sexual acts."
2809,the-daughter-movie,Cath Clarke,80,Few films make you care about the characters like this one does.
2810,apocalypse-now-redux-movie,Jonathan Foreman,100,"You won't see any film this year as beautiful, and plain thrilling as Apocalypse Now Redux. Watching it after sitting through this summer's record number of dumb, dreadful movies is almost a painfully good experience. [3 Aug 2001, p.30]"
2811,class-rank-movie,Kimber Myers,70,"Class Rank is a late bloomer that takes time to find its footing, but once it does, it proves to be as stealthily likable as its characters."
2812,brand-upon-the-brain!-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,"Not many people are making silent horror serials these days, but Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin pushes his love of lurid melodrama to the limit in his latest demented treat, Brand Upon the Brain!"
2813,psycho-movie,Mike Clark,63,"Untantalizingly reverent remake.  [7 December 1998, p.4D] "
2814,identity-thief-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,0,Identity Thief reaches impressive heights of laziness and idiocy. 
2815,apartment-troubles-movie,Gary Goldstein,20,"With the excruciating gal-pal comedy Apartment Troubles, writer-director-stars Jess Weixler and Jennifer Prediger have created such blurry, unappealing characters that their film is hamstrung from the get-go. "
2816,murder-of-a-cat-movie,Rex Reed,0,"Described as a satire on Hollywood detective flicks, this bucket of swill is so amateurish and confused it doesn’t know what it is. It’s not a comedy, drama or anything in-between."
2817,wimbledon-movie,Charles Taylor,80,"Slick, satisfying entertainment, as is the chemistry of Dunst and Bettany. "
2818,side-by-side-movie,Eric Kohn,83,"Produced by Keanu Reeves, this talking heads survey of the transition from shooting on film to digital video is against all odds an imminently watchable overview, and not only because Reeves has decent interview skills. "
2819,big-game-movie,Jake Cole,38,The rambling conversations and endless wandering through nature could let the film pass for a filler episode of Lost.
2820,assault-on-precinct-13-movie,Shawn Levy,33,"Hampered from the start by the numbingly formulaic additions by screenwriter James DeMonaco (""The Negotiator""). Toss in needlessly fussy visuals and a climax that is hilariously out of whack, and you've got an excellent excuse to stay home and watch the original."
2821,the-big-hit-movie,Nathan Rabin,20,"The Big Hit goes beyond the call of duty in terms of hateful, crass exploitation."
2822,the-memory-of-a-killer-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,70,"Although comparisons to the memory-challenged machinations of ""Memento"" are inevitable, the plotting here takes a more traditionally linear path."
2823,hounddog-movie,Mark Olsen,10,"The problems that plague the movie land squarely with the writer, director and producer, Deborah Kampmeier, who has crafted a howler of a bad script, shows little affinity for working with actors and displays no visual sense behind the camera."
2824,scary-movie-2-movie,Kim Morgan,16,"Stinky, boring, aggressively unfunny picture."
2825,it-happened-one-night-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"One of those stories that without a particularly strong plot manages to come through in a big way, due to the acting, dialog, situations and direction. In other words, the story has that intangible quality of charm which arises from a smooth blending of the various ingredients. Difficult to analyze, impossible to designedly reproduce. Just a happy accident."
2826,demonlover-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Has a dreamy ominousness about it, and a sorrowfulness that speaks to the artificial intimacies of cellular communication, digital images and dial-up porn."
2827,straw-dogs-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Rod Lurie has made a first-rate film of psychological warfare, and yes, I thought it was better than Peckinpah's. Marsden, Bosworth and Skarsgard are all persuasive, and although James Woods has played a lot of evil men during his career, this one may be the scariest."
2828,the-notebook-movie,Stephen Holden,70,"The scenes between the young lovers confronting adult authority have the same seething tension and lurking hysteria that the young Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood brought more than 40 years ago to their roles in ""Splendor in the Grass."""
2829,a-slipping-down-life-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"The movie is not a great dramatic statement, but you know that from the modesty of the title. It is about movement in emotional waters that had long been still. Taylor makes it work because she quietly suggests that when Evie's life has stalled, something drastic was needed to shock her back into action, and the carving worked as well as anything."
2830,boat-trip-movie,Chris Hewitt,16,"It's a lame, gender-mixed, mistaken-identity, cross-dressing comedy: ""Some Like It Tepid,"" if you will."
2831,mile-22-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,20,"A testosterone cocktail of reactionary sound bites and incoherent action that even Michael Bay might have rejected as too amped, Peter Berg’s Mile 22 makes for an appalling referendum on the state of commercial cinema in 2018"
2832,red-road-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"It's a wonderful debut, despite all the pain you may feel watching it."
2833,3000-miles-to-graceland-movie,Shawn Levy,0,"A vile, stupid and ugly movie lacking utterly in pep, thrills, humor, finesse or morals, a dissipating waste of time, money and human resources."
2834,big-night-movie,Steve Davis,89,"Big Night is, in a word, delicious."
2835,the-big-sick-movie,Alissa Wilkinson,90,The Big Sick feels authentic because it isn’t afraid of complexity.
2836,gods-pocket-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,83,"The performance, one of Hoffman’s last, is unostentatious, but sensitive. Hoffman inhabited lifelong losers better than any other actor."
2837,the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-movie,A.A. Dowd ,75,"The Killing Of A Sacred Deer doesn’t have as sharp an allegorical edge as his best work — it’s no Dogtooth in that respect — but it does find the director honing his command of unnerving atmosphere to a razor point, enhanced by a camera that glides menacingly down hospital corridors and gazes from above with the severity of a merciless god."
2838,jurassic-world-movie,Steve Persall,83,"Trevorrow hits all the right, respectful beats, as a protege should; you can sense a desire to please his mentor, with several amusing references to Spielberg's 1993 original, and a climactic, triumphant nod to another of his works."
2839,ready-player-one-movie,Eric Henderson,63,"It's a boldly attempted strike against the monolithic corporatization of fan service, and arguably one of the few films that defines dystopia as nothing less than a marketplace of trademarked, cross-promotional intellectual property. In other words, our here and now."
2840,valentines-day-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,0,"How you feel about Valentine's Day may depend on how you feel when someone really, really cute -- and someone you're really, really fond of -- gives you a nasty box of cheap chocolate on Valentine's Day, picked up at the corner Rite Aid and delivered with the price tag still attached."
2841,the-proposal-movie,Peter Rainer,16,Monumentally unromantic.
2842,slums-of-beverly-hills-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"The film, written and directed by Tamara Jenkins, is pitched pretty firmly at that level of ambition: Broadly drawn characters, quick one-liners, squabbling family members, lots of sex."
2843,street-kings-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"Wastes a moderately intriguing premise by filling it with laughably clichéd dialogue, one-dimensional characters and implausible turns of events."
2844,backdraft-movie,Michael Sragow,30,"Gregory Widen's script is like a Mad parody played straight, full of ""Scenes We Wouldn't Like to See."""
2845,jason-goes-to-hell-the-final-friday-movie,Ty Burr,0,"While the Nightmare on Elm Street movies possess a sick yet clever surrealism, and the first Halloween was at least well crafted, the Friday the 13th series has always been the cut-rate horror franchise, offering barely functional sex-and-slash pitched straight at the moron brigade. Jason Goes to Hell varies the formula a bit, with ideas swiped from The Terminator, The Hidden, and Alien, but after nine installments the impalements and dismemberments all look the same. So go to hell already, Jason — and take Sean Cunningham, the ”brains” behind this dreck, with you."
2846,columbus-movie,Sheila O'Malley,88,"Watching the film is almost like feeling the muscles in your eyes shift, as you look up from reading a book to stare out at the ocean."
2847,merry-christmas-movie,Melissa Levine,80,"But except for a few missteps, the movie is so beautifully and sensitively rendered in its particulars, in its characterizations of soldiers and officers, and in its dramatization of a nearly miraculous event, that the result is an affecting piece of cinema."
2848,the-tourist-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"If Elise and Frank are opaque to each other, they're opaque for a reason, as, sadly, lovers sometimes are. (Come to think of it, this picture has more in common with ""The Lives of Others"" than you might expect.)"
2849,harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-i-movie,Andrea Gronvall,70,"The best portion is an animated story-within-the-story, supervised by Ben Hibon, that recalls Lotte Reiniger's filigreed shadow puppets as it sets the stage for armageddon."
2850,little-men-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"Director Ira Sachs, who co-wrote with Mauricio Zacharias, has a plangent feeling for the small-scale travails of “ordinary” people – who, of course, are only ordinary on the surface."
2851,adult-world-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,"Adult World proceeds by fits and starts, but fans of Cusack won’t want to miss his performance as the petulant poet, whose resistance is inevitably worn down by his persistent fan."
2852,get-over-it-movie,Kevin Thomas,70,"A blithe-spirited comedy in which teenagers discover their romantic vicissitudes mirrored in their high school production of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" It's being directed by their nasty drama teacher (Martin Short, hilarious), who has written 12 original songs for the production."
2853,movie-43-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"If you mashed-up the worst parts of the infamous ""Howard the Duck,'' ""Gigli,'' ""Ishtar'' and every other awful movie I've seen since I started reviewing professionally in 1981, it wouldn't begin to approach the sheer soul-sucking badness of the cringe-inducing Movie 43."
2854,room-237-movie,Jim Emerson,63,"Trouble is, the Room 237 conspirators — er, contributors — don't seem to realize that those meanings are either not hidden, not meanings or not remotely supported by the secret evidence they think they've uncovered. "
2855,pitch-perfect-3-movie,Dan Callahan,25,"Wilson’s comic routines here set her apart from the others in the cast, and they more than amply hint that she should be set loose in her own vehicles far, far away from the other girls and all their “Glee”-like karaoke."
2856,underworld-blood-wars-movie,Peter Sobczynski,25,"The only notable aspect of the film is that it marks the feature directorial debut of Anna Foerster, a rare example of a woman being allowed to direct a reasonably large-scale franchise film. Alas, all it proves here is that a female director can make a film of this sort that is just as listless, derivative and perfunctory as one made by a man."
2857,colossal-movie,Rex Reed,0,"To quote the late, great Dorothy Parker, “What fresh hell is this?” I’m talking about Colossal, a delirious, moronic mess that landed with a thud at last year’s Toronto International Film Festival and now opens commercially, seven months later, with a head-scratching “Duh”."
2858,tuck-everlasting-movie,Ella Taylor,90,"Tuck Everlasting is a wise and beautiful poem to the idea that the fundamental human tragedy is not death, but the unlived life."
2859,love-friendship-movie,Staff (Not credited),83,"Stillman gives the romantic roundelay a deliciously modern feminist twist that ends up being a bit too slight and patly resolved, but over all too soon."
2860,saturn-3-movie,David Ansen,0,"The best and perhaps only way to enjoy Saturn 3 is to pretend that you're watching a ""Saturday Night Live"" parody of Saturn 3. Imagine that Harvey Keitel is one of the Coneheads, that Kirk Douglas is the guest host, lampooning his own overemphatic acting style, and that Farrah Fawcett is, well, Farrah Fawcett. Viewed in this light, the unintentionally risible dialogue by Martin Amis becomes sparkling comic repartee. Keitel to Fawcett, with nary a flicker of expression in his voice: ""You have a beautiful body. May I use it?"" [10 March 1980, p.88H]"
2861,left-behind-2014-movie,James Berardinelli,12,"Not only is this an amateurish travesty combining fundamentalist Christian eschatology with disaster movie b.s., but it's plodding and tedious. "
2862,racing-dreams-movie,Stephen Holden,90,One of the rare documentaries you leave wishing it was a little bit longer.
2863,very-bad-things-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"Pitched as a black comedy, the film thus far seems to have divided audiences between those who think it unaccountably hilarious and those who see it as the latest manifestation of what might be called the new nihilism."
2864,superfly-movie,David Ehrlich,67,It works because the characters keep things anchored to some kind of dramatic reality.
2865,yadon-ilaheyya-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"Too fragmented to be much more than a flip of the finger to history; the movie, with its mostly mute characters, is too content to plod. "
2866,murderous-maids-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,70,"There's a curiously ho-hum quality to the murders, despite the fact that the two victims are bludgeoned, sliced, chopped and jabbed, and also (the movie suggests) get their eyeballs gouged out."
2867,journeys-end-movie,Peter Bradshaw,80,"The first world war is one of the 20th century’s oldest, grimmest tales of futility and slaughter. Dibb and his excellent cast put new passion into it."
2868,the-wedding-movie,Rob Humanick,12,"For a movie ultimately about what freaks we all are behind the fronts we build for the sake of normalcy, the apathetically performed The Big Wedding couldn't possibly be more square."
2869,my-favorite-martian-movie,Owen Gleiberman,33,Flubber was more edifying than My Favorite Martian — and more fun. 
2870,waiting-for-superman-movie,John Anderson,100,"Exhilarating, heartbreaking and righteous, Waiting for Superman is also a kind of high-minded thriller: Can the American education system be cured? "
2871,gun-shy-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,This low-caliber Gun Shy has singularly ugly cinematography by Tom Richmond that at one point shows off Bullock's facial hair.
2872,the-road-warrior-movie,Ian Nathan,100,"It is the Road Warrior (as it was subtitled for the American release) that remains the definitive Max movie, hard as nails, hell for leather, it lands like a punch to the jaw. Don't drive angry? Yeah, right."
2873,phantom-thread-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,"If you’re making a movie about someone with exacting standards, Day-Lewis is your man. Yet what’s so exciting about Anderson and Day-Lewis’ collaborations is that while the actor is always superb, they’re very much the director’s movies. They feed off of one another, creating collaborative works that show off each other’s strengths."
2874,be-kind-rewind-movie,Robert Wilonsky,30,"A muddle—not amiably ambling, not affably shaggy, just a mess that gets messier till, at times, the whole thing looks improvised by amateurs more concerned with being clever than something resembling affectionate."
2875,far-from-heaven-movie,Tim Merrill,70,"Once again, though -- almost in spite of Haynes' rigorous post-ironic efforts to bring Sirk back from the dead in any and every way he can -- it ultimately comes down to Moore -- and Moore is simply...wonderful."
2876,not-fade-away-movie,Claudia Puig,63,"The highlight of Not Fade Away, a meandering and bittersweet coming-of-age story, is its killer '60s pop-rock soundtrack."
2877,down-to-earth-movie,Paul Malcolm,10,"The film seems to argue that Rock's real-life manipulation of the race card is little more than exploitation, rather than the essence of his incendiary comic critique."
2878,house-of-fools-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"For world-class lapses of judgment, Andrei Konchalovsky's House of Fools is a berserk overachiever. "
2879,straw-dogs-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"It's a crude, queasy, ugly remake of a crude, queasy, ugly, yet artistically superior 40-year-old Sam Peckinpah movie."
2880,39-pounds-of-love-movie,Phil Hall,80,"If there is one film which makes the most out of life, this is it."
2881,wind-river-movie,Rex Reed,88,"It’s one terrific, offbeat and heart-pounding thriller set in the frozen wilderness of a Wyoming Indian reservation that never ceases to surprise, enthrall and pump the adrenaline with an energy that stuns."
2882,serving-sara-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Even dumber than Perry's ""Three to Tango,"" this latest sitcommy exercise is sporadically funny in spite of itself -- and not quite as dreadful as you would suspect."
2883,the-phantom-of-the-opera-movie,Shawn Levy,16,"It adds up to a truly taxing couple of hours: ham acting, visual noise, aural torture, elementary plotting and unconvincing emotions."
2884,marley-movie,Scott Bowles,88,"Sprinkled with riffs, concert footage and home videos, the family-authorized documentary does what the artist usually did: When in doubt, return to the beat."
2885,toys-movie,Dave Kehr,25,One of the most mawkish films ever made.
2886,full-frontal-movie,Desson Thomson,10,The only way a self-absorbed treatise like this can get any kind of audience (not to mention distribution) is to cast famous people in it.
2887,john-dies-at-the-end-movie,Leah Churner,30,"The whole movie is an inside joke, a shaggy-dog tale that asks us to pay close attention to its twists and turns, but never rewards us for doing so."
2888,riding-in-cars-with-boys-movie,Kenneth Turan,30,"Buried under the miscalculations, the shamelessness, the off-putting and inappropriate broadness are sporadically visible souvenirs of a good project gone bad, hints of the unusual, bittersweet story that got away."
2889,topsy-turvy-movie,Ernest Hardy,90,"Leigh and his solid cast make sure that inside jokes translate to a broad audience, and that their rendering of the back-stage drama is smart, engrossing and often very funny."
2890,green-room-movie,Ty Burr,88,"Violence in Green Room is just bad. Unfortunately for its heroes and for us all, it’s also sometimes inevitable."
2891,motherhood-movie,Nick Schager,20,It’s a judgmental tale whose only payoff is carpe diem drivel.
2892,jaws-the-revenge-movie,Jay Scott,25,"Deja vu's too kind a term to describe what happens in the latest chapter in the lives of the characters created so long ago in print by Peter Benchley and brought to life - and, eventually, to death - on screen by Steven Spielberg. [22 July 1987]"
2893,black-and-white-movie,Barbara Shulgasser,25,There is really no one to like in this film.
2894,almost-peaceful-movie,David Sterritt,75,"The gently told comedy-drama is more colorful than you'd expect, using wry humor and lively music to keep sentimentality at bay."
2895,la-vie-en-rose-movie,Wesley Morris,75,"If even half of Olivier Dahan's robust film about Piaf's life is true -- and let's face it, much remains shrouded in myth and mystery -- it's a wonder she could get dressed in the morning, let alone forge a legendary singing career."
2896,bamako-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Never mind Hollywood's big-star, big-budget hand-wringing about Africa - Bamako is the real thing."
2897,a-clockwork-orange-movie,Derek Malcolm,90,"It is not a film the memory of which you will exactly wish to cherish. You may even, like me, reject the glib and icy pessimism of its message. But you will, I can assure you, find it difficult to put out of mind."
2898,the-duke-of-burgundy-movie,Ben Nicholson,80,The Duke of Burgundy lingers long in the mind and cements its director's much-deserved place as one of the most exhilarating currently at work.
2899,the-majestic-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"It can't fake sincerity. It tries ever so hard, but it doesn't have a single believable second. Every word in it is a lie."
2900,i-love-you-beth-cooper-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"This unfunny, unoriginal, charmless teen comedy is so stunningly awful from start to finish, it's amazing to think its director has made a single film before, much less a dozen."
2901,the-killer-elite-movie,Sara Maria Vizcarrondo,30,"We all have to make jokes around the water cooler, and if enough people bother to see Killer Elite, its silly nonsense could make for a great comedy routine by Greg from IT. "
2902,white-god-movie,Ann Hornaday,63,"Even those who don’t buy in completely to Mundruczo’s parable will be impressed by his canine crowd scenes, staged with ambition, skill and genuinely original vision."
2903,the-school-of-rock-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"An exuberant, raucous and thoroughly endearing comedy"
2904,the-purge-movie,Peter Keough,38,The problem with high concepts like this is cooking up a story and characters to go along with it.
2905,manda-bala-send-a-bullet-movie,Ella Taylor,80,"There’s no denying the sharpness of his (Jason Kohn) insights into a society that hasn’t so much collapsed as reconstituted itself around venality, profiteering and rage."
2906,brooklyn-movie,Gregory Ellwood,91,It's a damn good movie.
2907,envy-movie,James Berardinelli,25,"It's remarkably appropriate that Envy is about turds, because that's what the movie is. "
2908,the-identical-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"It's an idea that might have made for a mildly intriguing skit, but blown out into a full-length feature it's at best campy and at worst an amateurish, sentimental schlock-fest."
2909,phantom-2013-movie,Nick Schager,25,"Todd Robinson's film is a third-rate submarine-set drama until, in its final moments, it sinks to fourth-rate. "
2910,monkeybone-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,63,Wildly uneven collage of effects and live action is no Disney-bland vision of dreams gone bonkers. There's enough Freudian material to reupholster a thousand therapy couches.
2911,ant-man-and-the-wasp-movie,Joe Walsh,80,"With well-balanced humour, and a heartfelt father/daughter narrative, Ant-Man and The Wasp makes for refreshing viewing after the gasp-inducing drama of Thanos clicking his fingers. Sometimes, focusing on the smaller stories is just better."
2912,three-identical-strangers-movie,David Fear,88,"It's a compelling, twist-filled tale, one told with a highly developed sense of empathy, a few aesthetic missteps (perhaps it's time to issue a permanent moratorium on montages set to ""Walkin' on Sunshine""? Actually, scratch the perhaps there) and a knack for turning the triplets' experience into something bigger than just stranger-than-fiction tabloid fodder."
2913,four-christmases-movie,Michael Phillips,25,"As Vaughn's therapist mother, Sissy Spacek comes off best. But she's a rare bird of whom it truly can be said: She's always good. No matter how grim the material."
2914,planes-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,25,"The film feels second-rate in every sense, from the quality of its animation to its C-list voice cast."
2915,it-runs-in-the-family-movie,Megan Lehmann,25,An exercise in drudgery... The whole thing is so patently uninteresting it's hard to see it as anything but a Douglas family vanity project.
2916,alls-faire-in-love-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Putting it as kindly as possible, this pitiful romantic comedy directed by Scott Marshall (dad Garry did ""Pretty Woman'') peaks with its animated opening credits."
2917,mad-max-fury-road-movie,Keith Phipps,100,"If Fury Road were only interested in action, it would still be a stunning achievement, but the film has more on its mind."
2918,anywhere-but-here-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,Well worth seeing for the incandescent Portman.
2919,are-we-there-yet-movie,Maitland McDonagh,20,"Repetitive, predictable comedy."
2920,war-dogs-movie,Oliver Jones,38,"Scorsese’s movie did something crucial that this one doesn’t: it told the truth as it knew it. Honesty, or at least some version of it, would have been a very good place for War Dogs to start."
2921,machete-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"Rodriguez retreats into gruesome violence and flaccid comedy, grasping feebly for topical relevance by referencing the current immigration fracas."
2922,the-constant-gardener-movie,Peter Rainer,91,Essentially two movies for the price of one. But those halves add up to more than most movies right now.
2923,american-dreamz-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,The movie stands as a genuine offense against the venerable and indispensable institution of satire.
2924,nina-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"It is shabby, as well as disjointed, superficial and just plain dull, a dislikable rendering of a tumultuous life."
2925,the-best-of-youth-movie,Roger Ebert,100,It is a luxury to be enveloped in a good film.
2926,the-oath-movie,Marc Mohan,83,"Her film is just as effective as a portrait of two unknowable, individual souls caught up in events of global scale."
2927,repo!-the-genetic-opera-movie,Peter Travers,12,Misery is enduring this Rocky Horror Paris Show.
2928,the-bone-collector-movie,Michael Atkinson,31,"One of our very few consummate movie star actors, Washington can't quite elevate this dismal material as he's been able to do in the past, but he retains his dignity."
2929,tracks-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"Wasikowska is wonderful here, unaffected and affecting, but then she has long been a young actress conveying a rich and shadowy interior life on screen. She humanized the Tim Burton ""Alice in Wonderland,"" so clearly she can do nearly anything."
2930,end-of-days-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"We're treated to such a broad panoply of godawful dialogue, righteously shoddy acting, and, worst of all for an action blockbuster of this sort, subpar effects work, that's it's all you can do not to giggle helplessly."
2931,london-has-fallen-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"Perhaps these are dark times, both onscreen and off, but even if they are not, London Has Fallen is an hour-and-a-half of viciously Us vs. Them, Trump-style bad filmmaking on all known levels."
2932,resident-evil-the-final-chapter-movie,Matt Donato,30,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter proves that there's nothing left in the tank of this grossly nondescript zombie-shootin' franchise.
2933,adoration-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,"Adoration, which hinges on a number of coincidences, contains some really fine performances."
2934,1001-grams-movie,Wes Greene,38,"In the end, Bent Hamer's view of current international relations comes to down to a treacly rendition of ""Kumbaya."""
2935,being-elmo-a-puppeteers-journey-movie,Andrew Schenker,25,"Not everyone's life is compelling enough to warrant the documentarytreatment, but whether this truism applies to master puppeteer and currentSesame Street producer Kevin Clash is a question that Being Elmo: APuppeteer's Journey, Constance Marks's fawning portrait of the Muppet-master fails to answer."
2936,philomena-movie,Ann Hornaday,88,"At its core, this clever, wrenching, profound story underscores the tenacity of faith in the face of unfathomable cruelty. Evil may be good, story-wise. But virtue, at its most tested and tempered, is even better."
2937,untitled-red-sequel-movie,Roger Moore,63,"Red 2 goes down easily, from Marvin’s demented moments of relationship advice to Dame Helen’s tender and amusing “Hitchcock” reunion with Sir Anthony. There’s a knowing twinkle in their eyes, and in everybody else’s.“Yeah, we could’ve done a Bond film,” they seem to wink. “And it would’ve been a bloody fun one, at that.”"
2938,collateral-beauty-movie,Katie Walsh,25,Collateral Beauty is much more shallow nonsense than anything else.
2939,the-wolfpack-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"The most perplexing thing about this portrait is that, against all odds, the kids mostly seem outlandishly resilient and good-natured. I say “seem” because, again, I don’t entirely trust this portrait. Too much of what Moselle shows us looks tenderized. "
2940,rivers-edge-movie,Bill Cosford,88,"What Hunter does is to re-create, starting from the moments after the crime has been committed, the milieu in which its horrifying aftermath might plausibly have taken place. Without violence or suspense, River's Edge is horrifying. [29 May 1987, p.D5]"
2941,barton-fink-movie,Peter Travers,100,"Stimulating entertainment, as rigorously challenging and painfully funny as anything the Coens have done. But it's necessary to meet the Coens halfway. If you don't, Barton Fink is an empty exercise that will bore you breathless. If you do, it's a comic nightmare that will stir your imagination like no film in years."
2942,gattaca-movie,Lisa Alspector,30,The moody images and Michael Nyman's score aren't enough to salvage this banal 1997 science fiction story.
2943,crystal-fairy-the-magical-cactus-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,88,"Part drug comedy, part psychological drama, the movie is slight, but only superficially so. As the closing credits role, we’re left not with a sense of a day at the beach, but of what might be swimming out there, in the dark of the abyss."
2944,jennifers-body-movie,Nick Pinkerton,10,"This is the sophomore production from ""Juno"" screenwriter Diablo Cody, similarly told through ultra-stylized slangy teen dialogue, which is cool, in theory, in the way it respects the verbal resourcefulness of idle flyover kids, but is excruciating to listen to in actual fact."
2945,rock-of-ages-movie,Nick Schager,12,"If the Adam Shankman film's debasement of its subject into campy kitsch is the unavoidable fate of all culturally dangerous art, that doesn't make it any less palatable."
2946,the-girl-on-the-train-2016-movie,Lawrence Toppman,63,"“Train” makes its strongest impact in Blunt’s hands. Her vulnerability brings pathos to every scene she enters, making you wish the whole film could have been told through Rachel’s bleary eyes – and set in England, where she belongs. But it’s a pleasure to see her anywhere."
2947,smillas-sense-of-snow-movie,David Stratton,70,"An exceedingly sleek and handsome thriller, this ambitious European co-production, like the novel on which it's quite faithfully based, starts intriguingly but fails to stay the distance. "
2948,skyline-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,20,"Skyline is a piece of junk, even in a movie climate littered with expensive - though sometimes fun - junkiness. "
2949,the-sweetest-thing-movie,Desson Thomson,80,That cameraderie is bound to appeal to women looking for a howlingly trashy time.
2950,the-salt-of-the-earth-movie,Bilge Ebiri,80,"It’s a fascinating meeting of three minds, and perspectives. Chief among them is Salgado himself."
2951,snow-falling-on-cedars-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"Loaded with facile social themes, opaque characters, pointlessly intricate flashbacks, and inflated technique."
2952,hillsong---let-hope-rise-movie,Andy Webster,30,“He can move the mountains.” “I was blind but now I see.” Those lines are but drops in the torrent of clichés saturating Michael John Warren’s narcotizing documentary Hillsong — Let Hope Rise.
2953,big-fat-liar-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"A bland, obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios."
2954,the-ghost-writer-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,"The result is a tight, taut, witty and highly theatrical entertainment, shot in shades of wintry gray, that will keep you guessing right through its final fadeout."
2955,coriolanus-movie,Liam Lacey,75,"It's a film of vigorous performances and provocative modern resonances, though it sometimes struggles to grapple with a grim, politically ambiguous, 400-year-old play. "
2956,bird-people-movie,Mike D'Angelo,91,"It’s also just magnificently goofy, unafraid to court ridicule and confident enough to take captivating detours."
2957,big-mommas-like-father-like-son-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"The comic, his career now apparently in total free fall, tackles the (dual) role(s) so broadly (no pun intended) that it's just plain annoying."
2958,humpday-movie,David Edelstein,80,"Lynn Shelton's marvelous chamber comedy Humpday butts up against the same sort of taboos as ""Brüno,"" and in its fumbling, semi-improvised way, it’s equally hilarious and even more subversive."
2959,genius-within-the-inner-life-of-glenn-gould-movie,Peter Rainer,91,It's an inescapable fact that Gould's singular musical insights – the way he brought out in Bach a mesmeric unity of sound – could only have arisen from a singular personality.
2960,sucker-punch-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"A soul-deadening mash-up of ""Kill Bill,"" ""Showgirls"" and dozens of other better flicks that's not the least bit exciting or sexy, Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch is what happens when a studio gives carte blanche to a filmmaker who has absolutely nothing original or even coherent to say."
2961,leviathan-2014-movie,Liam Lacey,88,"Call it what you like – a modern Russian epic, a crime drama, a black comedy or a scream in the dark – Leviathan is a shaggy masterpiece. "
2962,wall-street-money-never-sleeps-movie,John DeVore,38,"The pretentious title might be trying to make a statement about the new, fast-moving economy. It's also a weak reference to the first Wall Street. But mainly, no, it's just pretentious."
2963,mansome-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"So you get comments from the likes of Paul Rudd, Adam Carolla and Judd Apatow, all trying to be funny, but not one says anything remotely amusing or worth hearing."
2964,urban-legends-final-cut-movie,Cody Clark,5,"As for genuine willies, well, chances are you've had more disturbing encounters with, say, a belligerent Shih Tzu."
2965,thats-what-i-am-movie,Alison Willmore,33,"It's a dogged family entertainment determined to teach lessons about tolerance and how it should be extended to everyone, even redheads, gay people, and kids with cooties. "
2966,kick-ass-2-balls-to-the-wall-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"The writer and director, Jeff Wadlow, can’t obscure the movie’s misogyny, and he also has a tough time staging a scene and selling a joke. His worst offense is that he has no understanding of the power, gravity and terrible beauty of violent imagery, which means he has no grasp of cinema."
2967,the-great-gilly-hopkins-movie,Glenn Kenny,63,"A spectacularly foursquare “family is what you make it” redemption story. The kind of thing that film critics like to dismiss as “looking like a made-for-TV movie,” as if that comparison/analogy even holds as a dismissal anymore. "
2968,man-of-the-century-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,Grows tiresome rather quickly.
2969,an-affair-of-love-movie,John Petrakis,63,"Halfway through, it becomes clear that the filmmakers don't know how to end the film."
2970,the-patriot-movie,Ann Hornaday,38,Overblown sanctimony and sentimentalism as corny as the Fourth of July.
2971,did-you-wonder-who-fired-the-gun-movie,Carson Lund,88,"In directly requesting the audience's trust, Travis Wilkerson initiates a not-particularly-inviting proposition for the viewer, and specifically the white American viewer."
2972,apocalypse-now-redux-movie,Liam Lacey,100,"If Apocalypse Now was criticized in the past as a series of impressive sequences that don't quite add up to a tidy story, the new additions put this in perspective. It's a filmed epic, not a filmed drama. [10 Aug 2001, p.R1]"
2973,rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"Judged, though, as the action extravaganza it means to be, Rise of the Planet of the Apes wins high marks for originality, and takes top honors for spectacle."
2974,imagine-me-you-movie,Allison Benedikt,38,I guess there's something progressive going on when a lesbian love story gets to be just as dreadful and tacky as most straight ones.
2975,career-girls-movie,Robert Faires,89,"An abundance of feeling plays across the faces of his two leads; Cartlidge and Steadman bring to light every flicker of awkwardness, indecision, anger, regret, joy, admiration, and affection felt by Hannah and Annie."
2976,son-of-saul-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"Thanks to his taste, rigor and superb sense of control, Nemes manages to create images that are both discreet and graphic, respectful and confrontational, inspiring and unsparing. "
2977,the-last-picture-show-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"It's meant to make you feel sad for what's lost, but a vitality throbs through it. "
2978,under-solen-movie,Kevin Thomas,80,"Casts a lovely spell, as warm and seductive as its summertime setting."
2979,eight-below-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,"The movie is overly long and much too intense for small children, yet it's filled with dialogue and plot turns that are too juvenile to thrill adult audiences."
2980,noel-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,30,David Hubbard's script is so steeped in sludgy sentimentality that the film's early hints of quirkiness quickly give way to heavy-handed faith healing.
2981,xxx-state-of-the-union-movie,Michael Wilmington,38,"What isn't scary--or exciting, amusing or fun--is XXX: State of the Union, a movie so preposterous, cliché-packed and over the top that it makes the original ""XXX"" seem as good as the original ""State of the Union."""
2982,somethings-gotta-give-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"Despite the weak dialogue, there are still some laughs to be had. At the end of this long journey, we're rooting for Harry and Erica to be together. For the movie to get us to that point, regardless of its motives and methods, it can't be all bad. "
2983,before-midnight-movie,James Berardinelli,100,It's a rare and powerful thing to confront something honest and real on the big screen. It stays with you in a way that nothing else can. Before Midnight is fiction but it might as well be a documentary. 
2984,all-about-my-mother-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,80,"It's enough to make your head spin, but Almodovar, whose mastery of the medium has never been more assured, gives you plenty to think about, ultimately grounding the dizzy whirl of his idiosyncratic fictional world in a story that feels not just true but universal."
2985,encino-man-movie,Desson Thomson,0,Cro-Magnon-dumb...Less funny than your own funeral.
2986,smashed-movie,Stephen Holden,90,"The degree to which Smashed refuses to indulge a voyeuristic taste for the kind of sordid details exploited by reality television amounts to an unspoken declaration of principle. In lieu of self-pity, Smashed substitutes tough love. "
2987,couples-retreat-movie,Michael Sragow,25,Finds it as impossible to locate a laugh in glittering Bora Bora as it was for Operation Enduring Freedom to nail Osama bin Laden in gritty Tora Bora.
2988,zookeeper-movie,Mark Feeney,38,"As for other voices, the most notable are Adam Sandler, whose capuchin monkey wears out his welcome pretty quickly; Maya Rudolph, whose jivey giraffe comes perilously close to aural blackface; and Nick Nolte's gorilla."
2989,while-were-young-movie,Ann Hornaday,88,"Baumbach judiciously calibrates fantasy and realism throughout While We’re Young and winds up sharing impressions about parenthood, friendship, ambition and aging that viewers themselves most likely have harbored, whether they admit it or not. Even at its most confected, this is a film that tells the truth."
2990,rushmore-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,80,"Battling back with droll seriousness, Murray imbues his sad-sack loner with a touching, funny dignity, and comes up with his best work in a very long time."
2991,sexy-beast-movie,Desson Thomson,80,"A Molotov cocktail of a movie, an engaging conflagration of British B-flick, cockney wit and gallows humor. There's even a delicate little love story in there."
2992,that-awkward-moment-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"That Awkward Moment is a rom-com for dudes that seeks to outdo the ladies by being even more insipid, formulaic and contrived than anything Katherine Heigl has ever done."
2993,man-on-a-ledge-movie,Stephen Holden,10,Rarely has a film exhibited a bigger disconnect between urban realism and utter ludicrousness. 
2994,mississippi-burning-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,"A powerful drama about the murder of three civil-rights workers in the South. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are FBI men investigating. A legitimate Oscar contender. [6 Jan 1989, p.5D]"
2995,broken-flowers-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"An engaging exercise in mature poignancy, existential consciousness and deadpan drollery, Broken Flowers is a return by Jarmusch to the road movie structure of such films as ""Stranger Than Paradise,"" ""Night on Earth"" and ""Dead Man."""
2996,8mm-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,"That 8MM fails miserably as a psychological thriller is forgivable. The fact that it is nearly as creepy, sleazy, and manipulative as the pornographic films it so cluelessly and hypocritically condemns is not."
2997,the-other-sister-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,"Contrived, clueless, reprehensible. "
2998,the-mummy-2017-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,A movie that goes beyond defying comprehension to being truly incomprehensible.
2999,christine-movie,Tim Grierson,100,"A magnificent performance from Rebecca Hall is Christine’s clear highlight, but the entire ensemble shines in this stripped-down but deeply sympathetic drama. "
3000,28-days-movie,Roger Ebert,75,Bullock brings a kind of ground-level vulnerability to 28 Days that doesn't make her into a victim but simply into one more suitable case for treatment.
3001,margaret-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,80,"Margaret - titled after a poem - reflects its adolescent subject with striking accuracy. It can be frustrating and self-important, clumsy and naive. But it's also passionate, curious and filled with insight, so unafraid in its ambitions that even the flaws are interesting. Every bold vision requires respect; a few deserve celebration. This is one of them, imperfections and all."
3002,broadway-danny-rose-movie,Janet Maslin,90,"Broadway Danny Rose proceeds so sweetly and so illogically that it seems to have been spun, not constructed. Mr. Allen works with such speed and confidence these days that a brief, swift film like this one can have all the texture and substance of his more complicated work."
3003,hardcore-henry-movie,Stephen Whitty ,0,"Stupid as a bag of hammers and twice as loud, Hardcore Henry sounds like the title of the worst Kissinger bio ever. Actually, it's an action movie that feels more like you are trapped in a video game. A really, really bad video game."
3004,the-young-victoria-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,80,"Emily Blunt shines as the tough-minded British queen in this lush, and even sexy, period romance"
3005,hall-pass-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,"Hall Pass has half the right idea: Scratch out ""Hall,"" and just … pass."
3006,missionary-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"Derivative and otherwise lacking in originality, the film which features enough gratuitous nudity and violence to satisfy the genre crowd is a strictly by-the-numbers affair that probably won't be filling the multiplexes in Salt Lake City."
3007,uncle-boonmee-who-can-recall-his-past-lives-movie,V.A. Musetto,75,Perplexing but pleasing.
3008,gringo-movie,Rodrigo Perez,25,"Featuring a fittingly shallow funk-lite score by Christophe Beck, Gringo, is ultimately like a Taco Bell version of the ‘90s crime genre; tasteless, cheaply made and just as inauthentic."
3009,beyond-the-sea-2004-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,80,"Kevin Spacey, both as star and director, has created a hugely entertaining, highly empathetic portrait of a man for whom music was literally the thing that kept him alive."
3010,maria-full-of-grace-movie,Leah McLaren,100,A fantastic film.
3011,the-visitor-movie,William Arnold,91,"It works on several levels, and stands out as a wistful meditation on the psychological cost of 9/11."
3012,beloved-movie,Edward Guthmann,100,"Doesn't sanitize its tale of African American loss and survival -- the way Steven Spielberg's “The Color Purple'' did -- but delves deeply, heartbreakingly into an American tragedy."
3013,happily-never-after-movie,Ella Taylor,20,"Director Paul J. Bolger and screenwriter Rob Moreland have drained the affectionate wit out of the Shrek franchise's satire, giving us instead a barely sketched out story line and quantities of unimaginative CGI."
3014,the-gift-2015-movie,Marc Savlov,78,"The Gift, a psychological roller coaster on a doomed track, is one of the best directorial debuts in ages, hands down."
3015,thelma-louise-movie,Staff (Not credited),90,"Even those who don't rally to pic's fed-up feminist outcry will take to its comedy, momentum and dazzling visuals."
3016,gett-the-trial-of-viviane-amsalem-movie,Keith Uhlich,91,"All the performers are superb, though as the title suggests, this is Viviane’s show, and Ronit makes for an exceptional martyr (she gets a Passion Of Joan Of Arc-worthy close-up or two) who never loses her very human shadings."
3017,feardotcom-movie,Ann Hornaday,10,"A depraved, incoherent, instantly disposable piece of hackery."
3018,murder-by-numbers-movie,Chris Fujiwara,63,"For much of its length, the film is plausible, if predictable and ponderous. Its strongest assets are its actors."
3019,cutthroat-island-movie,Jay Boyar,25,"Cutthroat Island isn't so much a movie as it is a burial at sea. As a longtime Geena Davis fan, I hope she won't go down with the ship. [22 Dec 1995, p.M10]"
3020,una-noche-movie,Ed Gonzalez,63,"Una Noche tugged at my heartstrings, but the film's almost phantasmagoric fixation on sex can feel crass and dehumanizing."
3021,swept-away-movie,Megan Lehmann,0,Not as bad as rumor would have it. It's worse.
3022,hunger-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"A disturbingly avid re-creation of the last six weeks in the life and slow, self-imposed wasting of Irish hunger striker Bobby Sands."
3023,wake-in-fright-1971-movie,Rex Reed,100,Wake in Fright is the closest a movie can get to a primal scream.
3024,blackhat-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,"Technology may have changed, cyber-crime may be all the rage, but the narrative song remains the same in films like this, and it's a tune this director knows by heart."
3025,dream-house-2011-movie,Sara Maria Vizcarrondo,10,"The real problem is, when the film blindsides us with a mystery we didn't know existed, we're already too busy not caring about mystery we knew was there."
3026,hellboy-ii-the-golden-army-movie,Lawrence Toppman,63,"Fanboys won't mind the absence of depth or emotion; they may even welcome it for making the film more representative of its comic-book origins. The rest of us, however, cannot rejoice at the overspending and overkill likely to come in Hellboy III."
3027,the-trip-2011-movie,Richard Corliss,90,"The Trip may have familiar elements - it's pretty much ""My Dinner With Andre"" pinned to the plot of Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"" - but the badinage provides an immediate and lasting kick, as well as the spectacle of two champion combatants at the top of their game."
3028,premonition-movie,Anthony Lane,30,"Although Premonition is not a frightening movie, it is aimed squarely at an audience of frightened souls."
3029,prince-avalanche-movie,Dennis Harvey,70,"An unconventional, ultimately rather sweet buddy pic that’s an audiovisual treat."
3030,crash-1997-movie,Kenneth Turan,10,The filmmaking here is so glacially paced (the final script was only 62 pages for a 100-minute film) and enervating that boredom is the most frequent result.
3031,captain-underpants-the-first-epic-movie-movie,Roger Moore,75,"An endlessly inventive and anarchic Dreamworks romp based on the Dav Pilkey children’s books, it thrives on prankster pals, over-matched adults and a hand-drawn comic book hero’s ethos."
3032,fantasia2000-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,88,Still a one-of-a-kind mind-blower.
3033,wasted!-the-story-of-food-waste-movie,G. Allen Johnson,100,"In the face of this relentless nihilism, it’s quite an achievement that the new documentary Wasted! The Story of Food Waste is so darned entertaining and hopeful, as well as informative."
3034,father-figures-movie,Owen Gleiberman,20,Father Figures...is a limply spritzing fountain of unconvincing (and unfunny) tricks out of the how-to-write-a-comedy-hit manual.
3035,the-invisible-war-movie,Ann Hornaday,75,"Dick, whose films include a revealing expose about the movie industry's film ratings board, has created yet another galvanizing call to action with The Invisible War. "
3036,special-correspondents-movie,Roger Moore,25,"Gervais fakes caring about character, jokes or doing the work to make Special Correspondents come off. He’s never made a worse film. And topping that, he’s never made a lazier one."
3037,domestic-disturbance-movie,Michael Dequina,10,"The real ""disturbance"" in Domestic Disturbance is not in the home, but in the careers of all involved."
3038,almost-famous-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"Crowe, staying close to his memories, has gotten it, for perhaps the first time, onto the screen."
3039,knock-knock-movie,Drew McWeeny,83,"Knock Knock has something genuine to say, and it uses some really dark dramatic beats to get there."
3040,end-of-days-movie,Jay Carr,38,"It seems endless. It's also unusually crude and stupid, even for an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie."
3041,white-material-movie,Stan Hall,91,"The result is somewhat elliptical but also thoroughly engrossing and propulsive. Compared to Denis' earlier work, it's practically an action movie. "
3042,the-limehouse-golem-movie,Josh Winning,80,"Weird, twisted and deliciously unique, Medina’s horror taps a dynamic vein in feminism and Giallo-esque gore."
3043,tau-movie,Jim Vorel,62,"It’s just passable popcorn entertainment for a Friday night on the couch, and not on the same level as more inspired Netflix genre movies from the likes of Mike Flanagan, such as Hush or Gerald’s Game."
3044,the-family-fang-movie,Nikola Grozdanovic,75,"A dysfunctional structure and some bizarre plotting stop the film from reaching greatness, but never from being endearingly satisfying."
3045,the-hangover-part-iii-movie,Rick Groen,0,"Not just bad, but weirdly, fascinatingly bad."
3046,maurice-movie,ALS,80,"Rich in atmosphere, its leisurely pace dwells on repressed passions in Edwardian society."
3047,valentines-day-movie,Kimberley Jones,20,"Aggressively unfunny and unromantic, Valentine’s Day’s chief concern appears to have been the corralling of its cast of a thousand stars; it seems far less attention was paid to what to do with that cast once assembled."
3048,guess-whos-coming-to-dinner-movie,Bosley Crowther,80,"A most delightfully acted and gracefully entertaining film, fashioned much in the manner of a stage drawing-room comedy, that seems to be about something much more serious and challenging than it actually is."
3049,im-still-here-movie,Claudia Puig,25,It's really not much fun - in fact it's painful - to watch an actor on the verge of a nervous breakdown. It almost doesn't matter if the psyche in question is imploding artificially - as in staged - or organically.
3050,the-disaster-artist-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"This movie is seriously funny, surprisingly funny, not funny in a way that you ever decide to laugh, but funny like you couldn’t keep quiet even if you wanted to. The laughs, as they say, keep coming."
3051,election-1999-movie,Mary Elizabeth Williams,80,"Wickedly funny, an ode to youthful overachievers that's as blackhearted as ""Rushmore"" was gently sentimental."
3052,toy-soldiers-movie,Staff (Not Credited),70,"The kids' attainment of self-respect and adulthood through sabotage and risky business is achieved at considerable cost, with Petrie pulling no punches in his depiction of violence. The exciting action set pieces, likewise, are staged with a verve and skill above and beyond the call of duty."
3053,love-object-movie,Carla Meyer,0,Misbegotten mess.
3054,how-i-live-now-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Drama is as much about perspective as it is about events, and the angle provided by How I Live Now turns out to be self-defeating."
3055,hostage-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on Hostage, a pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero."
3056,phantoms-movie,Stephen Holden,10,The movie's computer animation is so cut-rate and its direction (by Joe Chappelle) so slack that the attacks are virtually terror-free.
3057,stoker-movie,Rodrigo Perez,16,"The risible Stoker is a brutally empty, deeply unfortunate movie, and Park Chan-wook's jackhammer of a tool he calls a brush is, on this evidence, something that should be locked away."
3058,central-intelligence-movie,Roger Moore,63,"It dawdles between action beats and big laughs, and in the third act, that lets much of the wind out of it."
3059,beneath-2014-movie,Brian Tallerico,25,"When does a bad, cheap horror movie becomes something more offensively horrible? When it pegs its generic nonsense on real-life tragedy and becomes exploitation. Ben Ketai’s Beneath, not to be confused with the Larry Fessenden film of the same name from last year, is the kind of mediocrity one finds on The Movie Channel on a Saturday night and pretty easily dismisses."
3060,mississippi-grind-movie,Tricia Olszewski,85,Mississippi Grind winds up being that rare beast: the buddy comedy where you’re not tired of the buddies well before the credits roll.
3061,field-of-lost-shoes-movie,Nick Schager,10,The film stands as a pinnacle of revisionist bullshit.
3062,crush-movie,Loren King,75,MacDowell offers an engaging portrait of a complex woman who has survived life's slings and arrows. It makes Crush an affecting take on modern women.
3063,x-men-apocalypse-movie,Tim Grierson,70,"The X-Men adventures keep getting bigger, but Singer works extremely hard to ensure that, even when they’re not always better, they continue to thrill sufficiently."
3064,julieta-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"Almodóvar presents this material in a way that never splits our attention, even as he’s giving us a deluge of sensory and emotional detail. It’s as if he’s internalized the story so completely that he can’t make a gesture — can’t move the camera, can’t shape a moment — without saying something true. "
3065,saw-3d-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"The dismemberment and torture are now shtick. The filmmakers - ""Saw"" veterans - struggle to imbue this movie with the usual righteousness."
3066,blackfish-movie,Eric Kohn,91,"The movie makes a strong case against the captivity of killer whales under sub-circus conditions, but the stance is made even more horrifying because so little has changed in the history of the organization. Blackfish is less balanced investigation than full-on takedown of a broken system."
3067,alpha-movie,Liam Lacey,75,"Alpha aims to be not just a story but a transporting visual experience, which is one area where it over-reaches. "
3068,paint-it-black-movie,Katie Walsh,67,"Tamblyn’s at no loss of interesting things to say and show on screen, and Paint it Black has some real gems among the jumble, especially Shawkat, who ably shoulders the task at hand, and gives a raw and sensitive performance of a woman dealing with the loss of a lover far too young. "
3069,spartan-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"The patter is always fascinating, and at right angles to the action. [Mamet]'s like a magician who gets you all involved in his story about the King, the Queen and the Jack, while the whole point is that there's a rabbit in your pocket."
3070,the-divide-movie,Rex Reed,0,"Expect the dregs for weeks to come, but I can safely say with absolutely no trepidation that it is unlikely to get worse than a lurid, lewd and loathsome shockfest called The Divide."
3071,smashed-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"The movie has some powerful moments, but it's mostly superficial."
3072,i-am-michael-movie,Diego Semerene,12,Justin Kelly's film is more interested in rushing through the narrative's events than contemplating their environment.
3073,boyhood-movie,Liz Beardsworth,100,"Linklater’s beautiful film is an extraordinary achievement — tender, funny, wise and wistful, full of warmth and humanity."
3074,willard-movie,Kim Morgan,83,"The ""Citizen Kane"" of rat movies makes for a terrific overhaul in this wonderfully entertaining and, yes, touching take on that terribly confused man/child named Willard. "
3075,xxx-state-of-the-union-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,How bad does it get? How far past the basement can one elevator go?

3079,smurfs-the-lost-village-movie,David Ehrlich,16,"The Lost Village may be awful, but it’s not malicious. It doesn’t flaunt its mediocrity or celebrate its ugliness — it isn’t “Sing.”"

3081,universal-soldier-movie,Richard Dyer,63,"German director Roland Emmerich's action sequences are terrific and funny. [10 July 1992, p.37]"
3082,house-of-flying-daggers-movie,Maitland McDonagh,70,This film pivots on a romantic triangle as overwrought as it is stylized. It's like a Douglas Sirk melodrama ratcheted up with fists of fury and wrapped in apparently endless yards of shimmering silk.
3083,elle-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,88,"Strictly speaking, Elle is a comedy, a blacker-than-death social satire about bourgeois values, set in contemporary Paris. It’s viciously, demonically funny in parts."
3084,elling-movie,Bill Gallo,90,"Beautifully observed, miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama."
3085,miss-congeniality-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,20,"The jokes are lame, the set-up is stupid and Bullock, occasionally a winsome comedienne and here a co-producer, is annoying as heck."
3086,case-39-movie,Chris Nashawaty,16,An aggressively inept demon-seed chiller starring a bunch of grown-ups who should've known better. 
3087,secret-window-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"The film itself is an effective enough metaphor for out-of-control bullshit that frankly, Koepp aside, was part and parcel of King’s novella from page 1."
3088,west-side-story-movie,Kate Cameron,90,The film adaptation of Robert E. Griffith’s and Harold S. Prince’s stage production of “West Side Story” retains all the vibrant qualities of the original work while added brilliance and originality have been brought to the screen presentation.
3089,whipped-movie,Wesley Morris,0,Breaks new ground both as an abominable enterprise in guy-talk and as no-budget hackwork.
3090,bucky-larson-born-to-be-a-star-movie,Frank Scheck,10,"Unfortunately, the R rating will prohibit the target audience -- namely teenage boys who find penis jokes endlessly hilarious - from seeing this relentlessly unfunny and vulgar effort until it shows up on video and cable."
3091,dead-man-walking-movie,Jonathan Richards,90,"A complex, myriad-faceted work of art."
3092,cape-fear-movie,Staff (not credited),70,"An exercise in audience manipulation, with every frame designed to stagger the senses."
3093,robot-stories-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"Robot Stories isn't any good. I don't say this lightly. There's no pleasure in giving new directors bad reviews and it's especially unpleasant when what's wrong with their work isn't a clumsy performance or two, a sagging second act or a repugnant worldview, but a near-total absence of filmmaking talent."

3098,a-man-of-no-importance-movie,James Hannaham,10,"The film has that made-for-UK-TV-but-theatriucally-released-inthe-US look, The shots are claustrophobic and grainy for no reason. [27 Dec 1994]"
3099,zoolander-movie,Chris Gore,80,"Stiller is laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish and anyone that may quibble about plot minutiae, is just not ready to have a good time."

3102,taken-3-movie,Alonso Duralde,16,"Audiences the world over made Neeson an action star when they fell in love with his “particular set of skills” in the first “Taken,” but this third go-round finds both cast and crew opting not to exercise any of them. Everyone involved seems to be determined to quash anyone’s interest in a fourth chapter."
3103,how-to-be-single-movie,Nicolas Rapold,30,"This reheated “Sex and the City” adventure flops, even with Leslie Mann and Rebel Wilson hard at work being funny."
3104,pay-it-forward-movie,Peter Travers,10,"Crass manipulation can clean up at the box office, so do your part:  Nail this flick as a bottom feeder and pay the bad word forward to three others."
3105,the-secret-life-of-pets-movie,Kate Taylor,75,"If children will be entertained by the unwilling roommates’ narrow escape from cats, dog catchers and the Flushed Pets, it is the mass of surrounding detail, from the glittering Manhattan skyline and Gidget’s sleek modernist pad to the animals’ remarkable mastery of domestic technology, that will impress the adults."
3106,im-still-here-movie,Michael Phillips,0,"Rarely has the question of a documentary's artifice mattered less. I genuinely hated this picture, almost as much as I've admired Phoenix's work in everything from ""Gladiator"" to ""Walk the Line"" and even the hackneyed but affecting ""Two Lovers."""
3107,i-dreamed-of-africa-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,33,"A recitation of woes doesn't constitute a plot, and panoramic shots of migrating wildlife don't convey enough African flavor."
3108,be-cool-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"A classic species of bore: a self-referential movie with no self to refer to. One character after another, one scene after another, one cute line of dialogue after another, refers to another movie, a similar character, a contrasting image, or whatever."
3109,the-invasion-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"It's the pod people's version of a great, contemporaneously resonant cinematic fable, created by apparent committee, and utterly devoid of both meaning and feeling. The tagline warns: ""Do not trust anyone. Do not show emotion. Do not fall asleep."" Yawn."
3110,the-peacemaker-movie,Barbara Shulgasser,63,"The chief terrorist is played nicely with war-weary desperation by Marcel Iures, a Romanian actor with the sucked-in cheeks and ennui of a Jeremy Irons. "

3112,in-the-heart-of-the-sea-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"The script, by Charles Leavitt, is dead in the water, and the drama is too, despite billowing sails and pods of whales. Instead of “Jaws” it’s a turgid “Tails.”"
3113,into-the-west-movie,Jeff Shannon,75,"None of this makes Into the West genuinely unique, or even lastingly memorable, but by refusing to sugar-coat its story or characters the way so many family films do, this is a welcomed adventure that offers enchantment without blinding children to life's difficult passages. [17 Sep 1993, p.D3]"
3114,precious-based-on-the-novel-push-by-sapphire-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,"It's a potent and moving experience, because by the end you feel you've witnessed nothing less than the birth of a soul."

3119,stoker-movie,Sara Stewart,75,"Sure, it’s got its horror aspects. But for my money, this movie belongs alongside “Secretary,” “Ginger Snaps” and “Thirteen” in the family of deliciously dark female coming-of-age stories. "
3120,dantes-peak-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"Too bad that by the time the volcano shoots its wad, the movie has already died a thousand deaths, ground to a halt by the interminable waiting for the damn thing to blow."
3121,the-lincoln-lawyer-movie,Joe Williams,63,"Strikes an uneasy compromise between liberty and justice. It marches at an efficient pace, but there's too much collateral damage to believability."
3122,the-iceman-movie,Joe Neumaier,80,"As Richard Kuklinski, the Garden State guy who sleepwalks into an infamously deadly life he was born for, Shannon hits a whole other level."
3123,this-is-where-i-leave-you-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"You laugh in spite of yourself in This Is Where I Leave You, a potty-mouthed comedy with enough exasperation, aggravations, long-standing grievances and get-me-outta-here moments of family stress to strike a chord with anyone who’s ever had to endure large clan gatherings that might have lasted a bit too long."
3124,hostage-movie,Michael Wilmington,63,"Good action movies live on style and excitement. But they also need credibility, and in Hostage, ALMOST a good genre piece, plausibility keeps getting slaughtered."
3125,center-stage-movie,David Sterritt,75,Rarely has a dance movie done so many cinematic pirouettes with such a graceful sense of audience-pleasing fun.
3126,tammy-movie,Steve Persall,25,"If anyone could harness McCarthy's dynamo presence while protecting her from looking bad, it should be Falcone. Instead, Tammy suggests no one had the heart to tell this hot Hollywood couple that it wasn't working."
3127,cinderella-movie,Nathalie Atkinson,88,"Like its titular fairy tale heroine, Cinderella is sincere, not an ironic bone in it."
3128,into-the-abyss-movie,Peter Debruge,80,"These days, true-crime docs are a dime a dozen, and yet, returning to the ""In Cold Blood"" analogy, Into the Abyss dares to plumb the dark hole in America's soul. Herzog's investigation may not work as an anti-death-penalty editorial, but its findings are undeniably profound."
3129,charlie-countryman-movie,Jordan Hoffman,0,A pastiche of bad film cliches and scenes devoid of any real conflict or character development.
3130,play-the-game-movie,J.R. Jones,0,"This comedy is a bilge pump of tacky jokes, fake sentiment, and hollow performances, accompanied on the soundtrack by lite rock and hokey music cues. It should never have been made, though it's probably guaranteed a long life at bad-film festivals."
3131,no-stranger-than-love-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,30,"Few will likely embrace the insufferably chirpy, high-concept rom-com that struggles to stretch a mighty shallow premise into a feature-length proposition."
3132,bleeding-steel-movie,Katie Walsh,30,"Bleeding Steel is a cartoonishly crazy, completely nonsensical cyberpunk action flick that is torturous to behold, and well below Chan’s caliber."
3133,close-encounters-of-the-third-kind-movie,James Berardinelli,100,Close Encounters of the Third Kind is unquestionably a great movie.
3134,stage-fright-movie,Robert Abele,20,"None of it works, really, as either musical satire or genre Chex mix."
3135,seeking-justice-movie,Nathan Rabin,16,"To paraphrase a famous Mae West wisecrack, when Cage is good, he's very good, and when he's bad, he's better. Here, however, he's just plain lousy, and like the film he so passively carries, that's no fun at all."
3136,man-down-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,33,"The low-wattage, high-concept psychological drama Man Down is too misbegotten to be rescued by Shia LaBeouf’s Method lead performance; in fact, the most interesting thing about it is his masochistic commitment to the film."
3137,the-interpreter-movie,Mike Clark,63,"With major stars, a name director and grown-up subject matter, this middling drama is less a movie to recommend with vigor than to covet on general principles."
3138,three-amigos!-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"All great farces need a certain insane focus, an intensity that declares how important they are to themselves. This movie is too confident, too relaxed, too clever to be really funny. And yet, when the cowboys sit around their campfire singing a sad lament and then their horses join in, you see where the movie could have gone."
3139,the-man-without-a-face-movie,Janet Maslin,80,"The best that can be said about Mr. Gibson as a director -- and this is no mean achievement -- is that it's often possible to forget he was the man behind the camera. Most of this film has a crisp, picturesque look and a believable manner."
3140,after-words-movie,Gary Goldstein,30,The good news about After Words is that it offers Marcia Gay Harden a rare film lead. The bad news: Harden's role in this groan-worthy dramedy is so dreary and ill-conceived that even her formidable talents can't bring it to life.
3141,the-stepford-wives-movie,Karen Karbo,25,"So god-awful it falls into the category of needing to be seen to be believed. A purported satire of the 1975 camp horror classic, it succeeds in failing on almost every level, including knowing what it's actually satirizing."
3142,the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn---part-2-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"Boasts one moment, perhaps three or four seconds in length, so delightfully intense and uncharacteristically juicy that the rest of the film - most of the rest of the whole series, in fact - looks pretty pale by comparison. Not vampire pale. Paler."
3143,poolhall-junkies-movie,Scott Tobias,10,"Looks like a cheap polyester suit, an entirely synthetic composite of scenes from other movies."
3144,looking-glass-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Looking Glass fails to be anything more than another make-work project for the cinema’s busiest actor, a man with bills to pay and a conviction that the Devil finds work for idle hands. It’s just that sometimes, it’s better to leave those hands idle than to take whatever the next offer you can squeeze in might be."
3145,the-duke-of-burgundy-movie,Kim Newman,100,"Of course, this is a film you have to meet half-way. If you’re willing to enter its world, it’s an immensely rewarding, amusing, wise, melancholy and involving experience. "
3146,cats-dogs-the-revenge-of-kitty-galore-movie,Jennie Punter,25,"Aside from uninspired movie-parody gags, Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore suffers from gadget overload. "
3147,the-mummy-tomb-of-the-dragon-emperor-movie,Todd McCarthy,20,"Reheating the ingredients can't disguise how stale they are, as setpiece after setpiece strains to whip up excitement, only to fall flat while reminding of previous sequences that did such things ever so much better."
3148,the-snowman-movie,William Bibbiani,39,The Snowman is a detective vs. serial killer thriller devoid of any thrills.
3149,blue-chips-movie,Hal Hinson,30,"The picture amounts to little more than an uninspired, almost perfunctory exercise in ""big game"" manipulations."

3152,lumumba-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Lumumba is potent stuff. Complex, powerful, intensely dramatic."
3153,paper-clips-movie,Carrie Rickey,63,Touching and inspiring.
3154,hotel-artemis-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,67,"We’ve seen it all before in movies and video games, but the packaging is slick and hard to resist; any sci-fi crime movie with moody camerawork by Chung Chung-hoon, a Cliff Martinez score, a cast this strange, and an original end-credits ballad by Father John Misty (also a cast member) is begging to be watched, regardless of actual content or the messiness of the action scenes."
3155,reservoir-dogs-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"The part that needs work didn't cost money. It's the screenplay. Having created the characters and fashioned the outline, Tarantino doesn't do much with his characters except to let them talk too much, especially when they should be unconscious from shock and loss of blood."
3156,crash-1997-movie,Rick Groen,88,"You may well hate Crash, but if intensity is what you seek in a darkened theatre, you'll hate missing it even more."
3157,showgirls-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,"The story is so shabbily built that it can make no valid claim to motives other than the filmmakers' mercenary desires to cash in on the public's prurient interests. And even on this bottom-feeder level, Showgirls fails to deliver the goods."
3158,whipped-movie,Larry Terenzi,1,"Whipped is cinematic suicide, if not for actor, then certainly for audience."
3159,company-man-movie,Sean Axmaker,75,"At its best, Company Man hums from one piece to the next, a harmless, good-natured, often silly spoof with a few cutting barbs and a comic showman's love of the well-executed gag."
3160,unleashed-movie,David Sterritt,25,"Luc Besson's screenplay is dumb, but has just enough weird touches to give occasional glimmers of interest."
3161,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,Dennis Harvey,10,Disappointing in every aspect.
3162,chelsea-walls-movie,Jonathan Foreman,12,Calling it pretentious doesn't do justice to the toxic faux-bohemianism and unearned self-regard that bubble and ooze out of every aspect of Chelsea Walls.
3163,men-in-black-movie,Rick Groen,88,"Sonnenfeld moves things along with alacrity and panache, serving up the exotic visuals quietly, blending in the sprightly humour efficiently, and keeping the mix at a rolling boil."
3164,message-in-a-bottle-movie,Chuck Wilson,30,Even the easily weepy may grow impatient with the snail’s pace of this melancholy romance.
3165,and-everything-is-going-fine-movie,Ian Buckwalter,80,"Soderbergh imposes a shape until the film begins to feel less like puzzle pieces in search of their place and more like one seamless picture: It's almost as if, with this collage of the artist's past work, he's created an entirely new final monologue for Gray."
3166,chasing-amy-movie,Eric Brace,0,Can a script exploring some truly deep questions about human sexuality and emotions be any shoddier and wooden?
3167,the-comedy-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,20,"Unlike a truly daring movie like Lars von Trier's ""The Idiots"" -about a gang of clever jerks who pretend to be mentally retarded - The Comedy never musters an articulate indictment, nor does it have much to say on the subject of free-floating fatigue."
3168,i-tonya-movie,Josh Kupecki,89,"A riveting piece of cinema, successfully utilizing all the things that screenwriters are supposed to avoid: voiceovers, direct address, unreliable narrators. It also looks gorgeous, thanks to cinematographer Nicolas Karakatsanis and production designer Jade Healy. "
3169,alls-faire-in-love-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"There's punishment and then there's prolonged, squirm-inducing psychological torture, which is a more accurate description of All's Faire in Love, a romantic comedy that will only be ""romantic"" to audience members under the age of 14 and utterly devoid of genuine yuks and the necessary rom-com spark."
3170,under-the-sand-movie,Loren King,100,Mesmerizing and unforgettable.
3171,gods-own-country-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,90,"God’s Own Country weaves a rough magic from Joshua James Richards’s biting cinematography and the story’s slow, unsteady arc from bitter to hopeful."
3172,mamma-mia!-here-we-go-again-movie,Rex Reed,0,"Call this embarrassing dog’s dinner Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again or just call 911. Either way, it is nearly two hours of relentless, plotless, artless junk."
3173,godzilla-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,Godzilla is still the most awesome of tacky movie monsters.
3174,king-arthur-legend-of-the-sword-movie,Moira Macdonald,38,"King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” lumbers on for more than two hours, weighed down with oversized elephants, excessively populated action sequences, and weirdly sudden occurrence of slow motion, as if the film is yawning."
3175,demolition-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,25,"The film’s attempted cathartic payoff is inauthentic and unearned, and it’s a shame considering that Gyllenhaal once again gives a committed turn. "
3176,3000-miles-to-graceland-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"Here's a movie without an ounce of human kindness, a sour and mean-spirited enterprise so desperate to please, it tries to be a yukky comedy and a hard-boiled action picture at the same time."
3177,national-security-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"A sour story with a repellent lead character, deadly comic schtick and tin-eared direction to produce 90 minutes of sheer, plodding mirthlessness."
3178,paul-blart-mall-cop-2-movie,Christy Lemire,0,"Think of the worst movie you’ve ever seen – a movie that didn’t make you laugh, didn’t make you cry, didn’t move you or change you in any way besides giving you the desperate urge to flee the theater. Think of a movie that was a massive waste of your time and money. Hold that title in your mind. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is worse than that."
3179,the-scorpion-king-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,"Ultimately undone by its sheer busyness. The screenwriters never get the story to settle down, and it becomes a case of one damn thing after another."
3180,the-punisher-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"The Punisher is such a bad film that it becomes inadvertently entertaining; it’s enough to make you pine for the original version of the black-clad Marvel Comics’ badass, played to awful imperfection in 1989 by Dolph Lundgren."
3181,the-last-exorcism-movie,James Berardinelli,63,The Last Exorcism is one of those rare films where the marketing campaign is more interesting than the film it publicizes. 
3182,tangerine-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,83,"It’s the movie’s quietest, softest moments that register most strongly, be it Alexandra’s low-key performance of Victor Herbert’s “Toyland” to an almost empty bar, or the final scene, which finds her and Sin-Dee alone in a Laundromat at the end of a long, bad night."
3183,the-yards-movie,Richard Corliss,30,So muted it disappears from your view even before it recedes from your memory.
3184,the-ambassador-movie,Kyle Smith,88,"Picture Graham Greene crossed with James Bond, with a splash of Sacha Baron Cohen, and you'll start to imagine the nervy talents of Mads Brügger, the fearless Danish filmmaker who has for a second time come up with a stunning, funny, and vital piece of guerilla cinema."
3185,avp-alien-vs-predator-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"The film is critic-proof and it will find an audience, but it's hard to imagine even the film's target demographic (teenage boys) being overly enthusiastic about the product. It's disposable entertainment of the worst kind."
3186,prisoners-movie,David Denby,90,Villeneuve has what I keep looking for in directors: a charged sense of the way the world actually works.
3187,brighton-rock-movie,Calvin Wilson,75,"Doesn't rise to classic status, but it's an intriguing mood piece."
3188,frailty-movie,Carla Meyer,0,"Dumb but also unrelentingly dark and ugly, thereby depriving the viewer of any camp value."
3189,timecop-movie,Jay Carr,63,"There's been talk about Van Damme deepening his excursions into acting. Wisely, though, he keeps Timecop on a comic strip level. [16 Sep 1994, p.72]"
3190,mad-max-fury-road-movie,Soren Andersen,100,"“Fury’s” pace is delirious, the stunts are incredible — such crashes, such explosions, such a lot of flying bodies — Hardy’s performance is a marvel of subdued conviction and Theron brings an impressive gravity to her work as Furiosa. Put it all together, and you’ve got a rousing crowd-pleaser that hits on all fast-revving cylinders."
3191,ted-2-movie,Robbie Collin,20,"If every last joke in it wasn’t built on the premise that anyone who isn’t a straight, white, able-bodied, middle-class male isn’t intrinsically laughable, it might have made for lively comedy."
3192,land-of-the-lost-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"This lumbering, ha-ha-look-what-we-remade action-comedy is a high-concept disaster."
3193,the-dukes-of-hazzard-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,25,"The Dukes of Hazzard may mark some sort of nadir when it comes to movies made from TV shows. It's an overlong, under-thought and numbingly one-dimensional extrapolation of a TV show whose pleasures were, at best, marginal. See it at your own peril."
3194,must-love-dogs-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,20,"It's ostensibly about adults, but there's nothing remotely adult about it."
3195,mademoiselle-chambon-movie,Stephen Farber,100,"The simplest of stories can be elevated by first-rate acting and directing. Consider Stephane Brize's Mademoiselle Chambon, a French film that achieves a subtle but devastating impact."
3196,hide-and-seek-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"De Niro gives a crafty performance, and director John Polson (Swimfan) maintains a pleasantly low-key suspense. But the ending is a disappointment."
3197,sex-and-the-city-2-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"Indeed, this movie's offensive on many levels, but Arabs and Muslims don't get to feel special. It relies on stupid stereotypes because it's a stupid movie that's offensive to virtually everyone."
3198,see-spot-run-movie,Wesley Morris,25,Brutally dumb canine comedy.
3199,despicable-me-3-movie,Gary Thompson,63,"What keeps the movie watchable, for the most part, are the one-off flourishes built around incidental characters."
3200,chasing-papi-movie,Ed Gonzalez,10,"Shamelessly purports to be ""the first major studio comedy to reflect the Hispanic cultural experience in America,"" but the only place you're likely to find such shrill and whitewashed caricatures is in the elitist pages of ¡Hola!"
3201,the-hottie-the-nottie-movie,Peter Travers,12,"That generous half star rating I tacked onto  this comedy abomination is all for Paris Hilton. Come on, it takes guts (or gross dim-wittedness) to appear on screen again after ""House of Wax."""
3202,tortilla-soup-movie,Bruce Fretts,83,"At times, the movie smacks of a standard-issue Hollywood chick flick, especially in the obligatory scene where the women bond by singing and dancing in a kitchen (to Doris Day's ''Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps'')."
3203,swept-away-movie,Jeff Giles,10,It stinks.  The movie is so inert -- and Madonna’s performance so starkly amateurish -- that it’s impossible to take it seriously as an allegory about class and gender.
3204,the-million-dollar-hotel-movie,Ella Taylor,10,"How this hopelessly muddled and tedious dirge got released -- unless it was through the clout of Mel Gibson, who's grafted on as an FBI agent in a neck brace, with no discernible connection to the action -- is the real mystery."
3205,rollerball-movie,Peter Travers,10,"Say this for the soundtrack, it drowns out the lousy dialogue."
3206,this-means-war-movie,Ian Buckwalter,0,"With the material they're given, they mostly just seem foolish for showing up to the movie to begin with. Audiences would do well to avoid the same mistake."
3207,american-splendor-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,"The film has the dog-eared look of a homemade valentine and the improvised sound of '60s jazz, courtesy of a score by Mark Suozzo and a spirited soundtrack including Marvin Gaye's ""Ain't That Peculiar,"" which might be the film's anthem."
3208,femme-fatale-movie,Claudia Puig,25,"It tries hard to be sexy, mysterious and dangerous, but ends up laughably inscrutable."
3209,bride-wars-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,"I'd be hard-pressed to name another recent film so deeply noxious, soul-sick, and unfunny."
3210,spawn-movie,Lisa Alspector,10,This hopelessly redundant action gross-out aspires to a form of hip vacuousness--and may achieve it.
3211,the-devil-and-daniel-johnston-movie,Michael Sragow,100,The offhand wit and casual self-revelation of Johnston's best words draw you deeper into the mysteries of his character. Feuerzeig is a music-lover to his bones.
3212,robin-hood-men-in-tights-movie,Rita Kempley,30,"Robin Hood: Men in Tights is a pointless and untimely lampoon of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves from the increasingly creaky spoofmeister Mel Brooks. A predictable onslaught of bad taste and worse jokes, it mostly targets not the conventions of action-adventures but the sexual preferences of the merry men, who are variously referred to as pansies, fagalas and fruits. Brooks fills in the spaces with broadsides derogatory to women and the one interest group you can readily afford to offend on film -- blind folks."
3213,waltz-with-bashir-movie,Sean Axmaker,100,What begins as an introspective odyssey examining the effects of war on the young Israeli soldiers turns into a provocative exposé on the Sabra and Shatila massacre.
3214,blue-thunder-movie,Gene Siskel,88,"John Badham's exciting thriller about an L.A. detective (Roy Scheider) who battles against the government creeps who have created a monstrous helicopter to be used for 1984-style crowd control. Great action in a David-versus-Goliath story. [22 July 1983, p.10]"
3215,rize-movie,Robert Koehler,80,Eye-popping lensing and an appreciation of social complexities combine for an entirely satisfying experience.
3216,paul-blart-mall-cop-2-movie,Kevin P. Sullivan,25,Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 does all it was created to do: exist.
3217,over-her-dead-body-movie,Cortney Rock,38,"The silver lining in the film is Paul Rudd, who brings some nuance to his character that, given his past work, you can assume was all his doing. Jason Biggs, in his role as Ashley's gay best friend and catering partner, carries out an interesting, if somewhat left-field plot twist."
3218,election-1999-movie,Todd McCarthy,90,Brandishes the sort of intelligent wit and bracing nastiness that will make it more appealing to discerning adults than to teens who just want to have fun.
3219,the-order-movie,Wesley Morris,12,A stupendous bore. 
3220,rust-bone-movie,Richard Corliss,80,"Sometimes engrossing, sometimes exasperating romance. In these scenes, Cotillard shows she doesn't need the validation of Cannes or the Academy. Her strong, subtle performance is gloriously winning on its own."
3221,zookeeper-movie,Nick Schager,10,A comedy whose cliché-embracing stupidity borders on the surrealistic. 
3222,what-alice-found-movie,Merle Bertrand,70,"An unusual angle on the age-old coming of age story. Filled with solid performances by veteran actors Ivey and Raymond, as well as a captivating performance by newcomer Grace."
3223,vampires-suck-movie,Nick Schager,0,"It's a sloppy, tossed-off collection of parodic gags of vampire flicks and gratuitous pop-cultural references (oh, there will be pointless Lady Gaga gags!) that are below bottom-of-the-barrel."
3224,peggy-sue-got-married-movie,Staff (Not Credited),80,"Ignore the ridiculous [spoiler omitted] ending of this film, and you have a much more fatalistic exercise in which Coppola eschews easy laughs in favour of the exposure of feeling and the fact that these people's lives, however empty, matter to them. Turner is in the Oscar class. "
3225,bloodsucking-bastards-movie,Roger Moore,38,Why not wade in? Why not? That’s almost the only real action or borderline funny thing to it for 45 minutes or so. And it’s only 86 minutes long.
3226,kill-bill-vol-2-movie,Richard Corliss,90,"This being a Tarantino film, the conversations are as long and lurid and finely choreographed as the martial-arts set pieces. "
3227,all-about-eve-movie,Dave Kehr,80,"The dialogue is sharp and justly famous, though writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz has trouble putting it into the mouths of his actors: nothing sounds remotely natural, and the film is pervaded by the out-of-sync sense of staircase wit—this is a movie about what people wished they'd said. The hoped-for tone of Restoration comedy never quite materializes, perhaps because Mankiewicz's cynicism is only skin-deep, but the film's tinny brilliance still pleases."
3228,murph-the-protector-movie,Rob Humanick,38,"One wonders if the filmmakers ever asked themselves who their film was intended for, or if it was at least a consciously self-serving effort from the outset."
3229,the-birth-of-a-nation-movie,Peter Travers,88,A movie of potent provocation and surging humanity that ranks with the year's best.
3230,the-pursuit-of-happyness-movie,David Edelstein,70,"Conrad's last film, the underrated ""The Weather Man,"" was a parade of miseries, too, but the protagonist (Nicolas Cage) didn’t move very fast in the throes of his existential crisis, and the palette (it was Chicago in winter) was glacial. Here, those crazy San Francisco hills give the movie a lift, and Muccino frames it all airily, with a glancing touch."
3231,slackers-movie,Marrit Ingman,0,A singularly distasteful campus romp.
3232,our-song-movie,Edward Guthmann,75,The movie's soul isn't its plot but the relationships among the girls.
3233,always-woodstock-movie,Clayton Dillard,0,The filmmakers play Catherine's disgustingly narcissistic sense of entitlement as endemic to the supposedly girl-next-door charms befitting the film's thoroughly normative gender politics.
3234,sgt-stubby-an-american-hero-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,75,"Much like the way that Stubby was often underestimated before he found his calling, I came into this film not expecting how much I would appreciate a more thoughtful use of animation to tell an engaging story."
3235,days-of-heaven-re-release-movie,Peter Bradshaw,100,"The film, with its transcendentally beautiful visuals...is a rich and rewarding experience. [1 Sept. 2011]"
3236,blockers-movie,David Sims,65,"Blockers ends up being a mirror-image coming-of-age film, where the kids have to help the adults make some grand realizations."
3237,jesus-camp-movie,Rob Nelson,30,"The doc these kids would make with flea market camcorders couldn't possibly be as ugly as this absurdly hypocritical critique of the far right's role in escalating the culture war. The classier indoctrination to which Gap-shopping urban Democrats subject their kids might look damn spooky, too, but it probably wouldn't sell."
3238,when-will-i-be-loved-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"Most atrocious movies build into their badness, as lacks of talent, ideas, self-confidence, or a total hatred of an audience, are revealed. This one gets it out of the way up front and never looks back."
3239,bless-the-child-movie,A.O. Scott,20,A supernatural soap opera.
3240,the-bourne-supremacy-movie,Desson Thomson,90,Spy movies just got thrilling again. 
3241,jackie-movie,Moira Macdonald,88,"Jackie is mesmerizing; a familiar story told from an entirely different angle. It’s voyeuristic, to be sure — the scenes of Jackie alone in her White House bedroom, after the shooting, feel almost unbearably intimate — but you can’t look away."
3242,transformers-age-of-extinction-movie,Clarence Tsui,30,"Belying its ominous title, Age of Extinction barely skirts the idea that humankind and planet Earth are about to be totally annihilated. What is extinguished is the audience's consciousness after being bombarded for nearly three hours with overwrought emotions...bad one-liners and battles that rarely rise above the banal."
3243,compliance-movie,Andrew Schenker,12,"It seems as if Craig Zobel wants to implicate the audience in these proceedings, but he doesn't have a very clear idea how to go about it."
3244,till-human-voices-wake-us-movie,Ella Taylor,20,"I can find nothing nice to note about this excruciatingly slow, overly tasteful piece of whimsy."
3245,baywatch-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"The movie is all preening and very few laughs, though Daddario and Efron have a few moments, and Johnson remains a supremely likable slab of movie star."
3246,sgt-bilko-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"Bilko is a weightless comic creation, and Steve Martin, perhaps sensing this, drifts through the movie with a misplaced balletic goofiness. "
3247,it-follows-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"It Follows pretty much earns its buzz as the scariest and best-engineered American horror movie of recent years, and that’s all down to Mitchell’s sophisticated understanding of technique and the trust and freedom he accords his youthful cast."
3248,traffik-movie,Odie Henderson,12,Traffik begins with that classic cinematic lie “inspired by true events” and ends with statistics for women who have been victims of human trafficking. Between these two bookends is a steaming pile of exploitative horse manure masquerading as a feature concerned with the sexual enslavement of women.
3249,bright-movie,David Ehrlich,0,From the director of “Suicide Squad” and the writer of “Victor Frankenstein” comes a fresh slice of hell that somehow represents new lows for them both — a dull and painfully derivative ordeal that that often feels like it was made just to put those earlier misfires into perspective.
3250,titus-movie,Lisa Alspector,30,Even the most shocking elements of the story are made bland by childish overkill.
3251,hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-movie,Tasha Robinson,86,"A film that so perfectly reveals its characters both through the way they charge past calamity, and the way they subtly reflect their own pasts."
3252,antitrust-movie,David Edelstein,20,"Libel on one of the true visionaries of American business in the 20th century, a man unfairly demonized for doing what others strove to do but doing it faster and better."
3253,the-amati-girls-movie,Chuck Wilson,20,"The cast, which includes Cloris Leachman as the sisters' mother and Paul Sorvino, Jamey Sheridan and Mark Harmon as their various men, emote like pros, even as they deplete any audience goodwill left over from past triumphs."
3254,i-am-sam-movie,David Sterritt,25,"The film means well, but each scene gets clobbered by sappy screenwriting."
3255,some-like-it-hot-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,100,"If Billy Wilder achieved nothing else in his entire career, he would still rank as one of the great masters of cinema for pulling off this comic tour de force."
3256,like-someone-in-love-movie,Scott Foundas,100,The movie's sense of immutable desire resonates well after the lights have come up.
3257,hacksaw-ridge-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,70,"I don’t think you could tell this story properly or honestly without being forthright about the horrors of the Pacific Theater, and as Gibson dramatizes them, they put Doss’ actions in jaggedly sharp perspective."
3258,shame-movie,Scott Tobias,83,"McQueen is a showy director, but his bravura long takes have the effect of heightened attentiveness, allowing scenes to build in intensity without the relief of a cut. "
3259,the-color-of-paradise-movie,Desson Thomson,80,"A heartbreaker, plain and simple."
3260,it-runs-in-the-family-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"Achingly long and pointless, ""Runs"" is a movie about family that's dishonest in its presentation of every relationship. "
3261,loosies-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"Ridiculous and mannered, Loosies is light-fingered but heavy-handed."
3262,code-46-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Code 46 has a noirish fatalism that renders it a close cousin to ''Blade Runner,'' but Winterbottom's film, shot mostly in the light, uses the theme of memory erasure to peer into the eternal sunshine of tragically altered minds."
3263,ransom-movie,Steve Davis,20,"A reprehensible movie from just about every perspective, Ransom tries to justify the behavior of its lead character as something grounded in principle, but make no mistake about it: This is the act of a man who can't bear the thought of losing, a man who will turn the tables on his enemy at the risk of a beloved's death."
3264,x2-x-men-united-movie,Frank Lovece,70,The combat visuals that follow are as powerful as those of any war film.
3265,lemony-snickets-a-series-of-unfortunate-events-movie,Robert K. Elder,100,"Exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive."
3266,one-night-at-mccools-movie,Jonathan Foreman,12,"A strong, early candidate for the worst movie of the year."
3267,chicken-run-movie,Tom Keogh,90,"Finally, there's a female action hero for the summer of 2000, and she's a . . . chicken. But a chicken to believe in."
3268,overnight-movie,Wesley Morris,75,Overnight is about all kinds of in-the-moment emotional rawness.
3269,gullivers-travels-movie,Peter Rainer,0,"A movie of such stupendous uninspiration that, watching it, I didn't know whether to be affronted or hornswoggled. Movies this monumentally dreadful, after all, don't come along every day."
3270,my-super-ex-girlfriend-movie,Stephen Hunter,70,"The two starring performances are spot on. Wilson gets the tone that screenwriter Don Payne so expertly evokes: It's a weird sort of self-aware despicability...Thurman is beautiful, fearless and perfectly believable as a superhero."
3271,better-living-through-chemistry-movie,Nathan Rabin,20,"Better Living Through Chemistry suggests a new cinematic rule: the more impressed a movie is with itself, the less likely it is to impress a discriminating audience liable to have seen all its silly little tricks before."
3272,the-monuments-men-movie,Rex Reed,88,"This is their story. It is true. It is history. As a film, it is riveting, suspenseful, harrowing and exciting, and somehow, it also manages to be something rare among war pictures—a big-scale entertainment."
3273,alpha-and-omega-movie,Kimberley Jones,30,The 3-D angle is the only one I can identify to justify Alpha and Omega not going straight to DVD.
3274,deadline-2012-movie,Ernest Hardy,10,"The fact that real-life deadly racial animus in America is often cartoonish in its manifestation doesn't excuse Deadline's cliché-ridden characterizations of bigotry. Worse, the film has no pulse and no dramatic tension, despite its subject matter. It's a slog to get to its big revelations."
3275,the-witness-movie,Nick Schager,80,"The Witness functions as a project of not only confrontation but resurrection, as Bill’s sleuthing sheds new light on Kitty’s personality, romances and career, and thus finally re-emphasizes her as a flesh-and-blood person rather than just a famous victim."
3276,somewhere-movie,Rex Reed,12,"The latest calcified bore by Sofia Coppola is less pretentious than ""Marie Antoinette"" but every bit as inertly stupefying as ""Lost in Translation."""
3277,blue-valentine-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"Here's one vote for the most affecting, anguishing, revealing and prophetic scene of the movie year-and yes, it's all of those things at once in a powerful film that alternates between moments of earlier happiness and later pain."
3278,no-escape-movie,Peter Sobczynski,12,"Films don't get much dreggier than No Escape, a dreadful and creepily exploitative would-be thriller, low-grade trash that it is too silly and stupid to be as offensive as it frequently comes close to being throughout."
3279,taken-3-movie,Betsy Sharkey,20,"This time around the dramatics and dialogue are so laugh-out-loud funny that if there is a ""4"" — despite the promises that ""3"" is the final chapter — maybe it should be a straight-out satire."
3280,thoroughbreds-movie,Gary Thompson,75,"Finley ends with a poetic epilogue that draws themes into focus, and gives voice to them. I’m not sure the movie fully earns it, but it does grab and hold your attention, thanks to the frighteningly good rapport between Taylor-Joy and Cooke."
3281,night-watch-nochnoi-dozor-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"Frankly, after watching writer-director Timur Bekmambetov's grim fantasy - the first leg of a trilogy adapted from the sci-fi novels of Sergei Lukyanenko - I'm still a little confused."
3282,annihilation-movie,Brian Truitt,88,"A beautiful and brutal headtrip exploring the positives and negatives inherent in mankind's evolution, with characters struggling against losing themselves to something alien."
3283,the-revolution-will-not-be-televised-movie,Aaron Hillis,88,"While Bartley and O'Briain flat-out lucked out with this felicitous endeavor, their fearlessness, unobtrusive narration, and lack of Michael Moore man-and-microphone pandering is to be saluted."
3284,lethal-weapon-4-movie,Liam Lacey,63,"This movie is exceptionally brutal, cruel, savage and without conscience -- and that's just the comic parts. In contrast, the violent action sequences are quite entertaining."
3285,virus-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,"This suspense-free, originality-deprived mess will likely be a major contender for the title of 1999's worst film."
3286,evolution-movie,Peter Rainer,20,Began life as a standard sci-fi horror script before mutating into the unfunny mess it now is.
3287,careful-what-you-wish-for-movie,Matt Fagerholm,0,"Elizabeth Allen’s generically titled thriller, Careful What You Wish For, plays like a painfully stilted high school production of “Fatal Attraction.”"
3288,the-boss-baby-movie,Katie Walsh,63,"The Boss Baby is great fun for parents, but it remains to be seen if kids will get it at all."
3289,crossing-over-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Wayne Kramer's interlocking saga of immigration in 21st-century America definitely crosses over, from workaday mediocrity to distinctive dreadfulness."
3290,the-godfather-part-ii-movie,Don Drucker,70,"Three hours and 20 minutes of Al Pacino suffering openly, Robert Duvall suffering silently, Diane Keaton suffering noisily, and (every so often) Robert De Niro suffering good-naturedly is almost too much, but Francis Ford Coppola pulls it off in grand style."
3291,the-cobbler-movie,Amy Nicholson,10,The Cobbler has invented a new category of terrible: cruel schmaltz.
3292,beauty-and-the-beast-re-release-movie,David Sterritt,100,"The timeless fairy tale about a young woman who agrees to dwell with a mysterious monster, as interpreted in 1946 by one of cinema's most brilliant visual stylists and mythmakers."
3293,the-bulls-night-out-movie,Maitland McDonagh,30,Amateurish performances from nonprofessional actors undermine this ultra-low-budget crime drama.
3294,mean-machine-movie,Desson Thomson,30,Dramatically lackluster.
3295,she-hate-me-movie,Karen Karbo,16,Given the abundance of tedious sex in She Hate Me it's no wonder the whole thing's such a turn-off. 
3296,3000-miles-to-graceland-movie,Ernest Hardy,0,"A mean-spirited, hyperviolent, stupid movie."
3297,welcome-to-the-rileys-movie,Peter Debruge,30,"Nothing short of preposterous, Jake Scott's film imagines a grieving couple (James Gandolfini and Melissa Leo) who play surrogate parents to an underage stripper (""Twilight's"" Kristen Stewart) and spins it for the ""Blind Side"" crowd."
3298,flags-of-our-fathers-movie,Todd McCarthy,90,"Ambitiously tackling his biggest canvas to date, Clint Eastwood continues to defy and triumph over the customary expectations for a film career in Flags of Our Fathers."
3299,prime-movie,Ryan Devlin,38,"The sheer absurdity of the presented relationship is redeemed by a sort of surprise ending, but by the time it arrives, you wish it had come sooner, as the pain of viewing has already been interminably long."
3300,event-horizon-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,"The movie is very loud. It is pointlessly loud, arbitrarily loud, assaultively loud."
3301,iris-movie,Peter Travers,100,Director Richard Eyre has struck gold. Twice. Dench and Winslet are a riveting matchup.
3302,up-at-the-villa-movie,David Sterritt,100,"The story has old-fashioned characters and situations, and Haas has sensibly filmed it in an old-fashioned way, stressing visual appeal rather than the story's sordid undertones. The acting is excellent, too."
3303,a-poem-is-a-naked-person-movie,Farran Smith Nehme,88,What a trippy delight it is.
3304,you-again-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,30,"Has no inherent laughs, so an extremely versatile and talented cast struggles mightily to make something funny that simply isn't. "
3305,bad-santa-2-movie,Justin Lowe,80,"Even more inappropriate physical gags, foul-mouthed dialogue and outrageous situations all contribute to raising the stakes, as Waters pushes the cast to amiably outdo the original."
3306,flatliners-2017-movie,Peter Travers,25,I'm dumbfounded by the idea of remaking a movie that was no damn good in the first place. Is it the possibility of making it better? The exact opposite happens with Flatliners.
3307,the-9th-life-of-louis-drax-movie,Tasha Robinson,19,"There’s a hint of Aja’s old love of shock-value horror in this film, but it’s blunted by syrupy fake sentiment, mismanaged twists, and half-baked plotlines. "
3308,i-am-not-your-negro-movie,Jimi Famurewa,80,Peck’s film may have been an Oscars bridesmaid but it turns Baldwin’s prescient words into a staggering achievement. It’s an exhilarating blast of focused fury.
3309,the-long-walk-home-movie,Hal Hinson,88,"One of those rare movie history lessons that don't make you feel as if you're facing the chalkboard. It's an impassioned movie, with vehement, soulful performances from Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek, but it's also a work of great restraint and proportion. "
3310,thoroughbreds-movie,Peter Travers,75,The late actor (Anton Yelchin) brings a sly wit and bruised conscience to the role that marks him again as a consummate actor and another reason that the feverishly hypnotic Thoroughbreds gets inside your head and stays there. 
3311,the-social-network-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"David Fincher's film has the rare quality of being not only as smart as its brilliant hero, but in the same way. It is cocksure, impatient, cold, exciting and instinctively perceptive."
3312,brand-a-second-coming-movie,A.O. Scott,30,"Brand: A Second Coming wants to tell the story of a man overcoming temptation and trading a shallow approach to life for something more sustaining and profound. It’s undone by its own shallowness, and by the limited appeal of its subject."
3313,rough-night-movie,Thelma Adams,38,What I don’t need is more undercooked leftovers: elevator pitches that satisfy the suits (It’s The Hangover with chicks!) because risk-averse studios don’t want to take any chances with that chick stuff and therefore create a self-fulfilling prophecy of estrogen dreck.
3314,the-hurt-locker-movie,Peter Travers,88,Here's the Iraq War movie for those who don't like Iraq War movies.
3315,m-butterfly-movie,Kristi Turnquist,0,Director David Cronenberg has made a movie about a man who apparently needs to get his eyes checked. [08 Oct 1993]
3316,the-lion-king-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Basically what we have here is a drama, with comedy occasionally lifting the mood. The result is a surprising seriousness; this isn't the mindless romp with cute animals."
3317,spun-movie,J.R. Jones,10,A turkey of Rubenesque proportions.
3318,terri-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,80,Terri is almost an anti-teen-coming-of-age teen-coming-of-age movie. And it's terrific.
3319,doubt-movie,Scott Tobias,83,"Doubt is a complex, thematically loaded piece of work, and though it isn't enhanced on film, it deserves the wider exposure."
3320,amores-perros-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,"One of the great films of our time, or any other."
3321,nymphomaniac-volume-two-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,Here we go again. Danish director Lars von Trier has pumped out Nymphomaniac: Vol II just a few weeks after “Vol. I” came out. And the results are the same: zero stars.
3322,son-of-rambow-movie,Stephen Cole,75,Few movies have captured the intoxicating effect of pop culture on kids better than Son of Rambow.
3323,fifty-shades-freed-movie,Peter Travers,0,"With this last entry, we have officially hit the bottom of the barrel. Whips, chains, butt plugs and nipple clips are nothing compared to the sheer torture of watching this movie."
3324,first-daughter-movie,Manohla Dargis,20,"Plays more like a nightmare than a dream, and an exceedingly unnerving one at that. Sam isn't just a prisoner of her parents' ambitions; like nearly everyone else in this film, she's a zombie, sleepwalking through life while Rome burns."
3325,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,Richard Corliss,10,Few movies have spread their fibs or facts as clumsily as this one. There's not an emotionally plausible moment in the picture.
3326,the-divergent-series-allegiantpart-1-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"By the time David gets someone to unleash the gas, I was wishing he could simply erase all memories of the sorry “Divergent’’ franchise."
3327,eight-crazy-nights-movie,Mike Clark,38,"Myopic Whitey, continually passed over for a lifetime achievement athletic award, bears a passing resemblance to Columbia's all-time No. 1 animated star, the nearsighted Mr. Magoo. It's nice to think that if he ever went to this movie, he wouldn't be able to see it."
3328,the-bitter-pill-movie,Marc Mohan,91,"By the time the satisfying conclusion rolls around, though, it proves to be much more about the ability of a world-class director to induce such willing suspension of disbelief that even the loopiest narrative developments seem like the most natural thing in the world. "
3329,state-and-main-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,Delectably caustic comedy.
3330,the-wedding-movie,Nathan Rabin,16,"It’s almost impressive how the moronic new ensemble comedy The Big Wedding manages to cram three hours’ worth of nonsensical subplots, extraneous characters, and implausible plot points into 90 minutes of streamlined idiocy."
3331,joe-versus-the-volcano-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,75,"Like a lava lamp turned on high, Joe Versus the Volcano glows with originality. Go bask in it. [9 Mar 1990, p.4D]"
3332,wonderstruck-movie,Tim Robey,80,"Haynes’s vision of two New Yorks, a half-century apart, is a marvel of nested detail, never overbearing, and interested in things rusted and forgotten rather than shiny and new."
3333,garage-days-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,63,"Proyas creates an engaging, high-octane energy, boosted by an up-for-anything cast."
3334,the-in-laws-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"A walking-talking affront to every middle-class middle-ager it intends to sucker, this remake of the 1979 accidental-classic screwball hits every wrong note and trips on every chair leg. "
3335,kalifornia-movie,Mark Caro,25,Kalifornia is that deadliest of combinations: a pretentious B movie. It repeatedly smacks the viewer in the face and then pretends that it has some intellectual reason for doing so. [03 Sep 1993]
3336,the-nut-job-movie,Michael Phillips,25,Big problem straight off: tone. The violence isn't slapsticky; it's just violent.
3337,clerks-movie,Todd McCarthy,80,"A randy, irreverent, slice-of-life no-budgeter that's played for laughs and gets them."
3338,the-crimson-rivers-movie,Peter Travers,30,Makes you gag.
3339,papa-hemingway-in-cuba-movie,Katie Walsh,30,"The film manages to be exceedingly dull, perhaps because it's too enamored of its own design, concept and location to bother with a captivating story."
3340,the-whole-ten-yards-movie,Ann Hornaday,10,"Leaden, laugh-free, lacking anything resembling a heart, mind or soul."
3341,going-upriver-the-long-war-of-john-kerry-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"It's not a hasty, knocked-together promo job--though it is clearly pro-Kerry."
3342,spotlight-movie,John Anderson,90,"For all the dogged journalism and righteous indignation in the film, it’s this sense of intimacy, of community, of betrayal and misdirected allegiances — it was the Church, after all — that keeps the film from reveling too much in victory or triumph. That, in turn, makes it an emotional tour de force."
3343,the-chronicles-of-narnia-the-voyage-of-the-dawn-treader-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"Michael Apted's direction veers into listlessness, but there is, at times, a pleasing elegance to the production, too. It doesn't assault you. Small favors are better than none."
3344,rabbit-hole-movie,Richard Corliss,100,"Kidman, in a career-best performance, and Eckhart lend pitch-perfect calibration to the couple's shared and separate agonies. It's as if previous treatments of the subject were a series of failed experiments, and Rabbit Hole is the Eureka! moment."
3345,transcendence-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,"Ambitious to a fault, this cautionary fantasy about artificial intelligence has so much on its muddled mind, and so little sense of dramatic grounding, that it grows ever more preposterous before lurching to a climax that's utterly unfathomable."
3346,green-street-hooligans-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"Director and co-writer Lexi Alexander choreographs the fight scenes with thrilling chaos, and the plot unfolds expertly if melodramatically."
3347,quai-des-orfevres-movie,Michael Sragow,100,A gorgeous flirt of a murder movie.
3348,the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-movie,Chris Nashawaty,67,"Farrell delivers his lines with the same replicant monotone he used in The Lobster. And Kidman, the only cast member who expresses recognizably human emotions, extends her recent hot streak. But even she’s not enough to give this head-scratcher any real life. "
3349,clue-movie,Staff (Not Credited),10,"The bad news for everyone else is that the colorfully named characters from Clue remain flat enough to be stored in a box, and that all three endings are unpersuasive. [23 Dec 1985, p.79]"
3350,reality-bites-movie,David Sterritt,75,"At its best, this entertaining romance blends the zesty dialogue of a classic screwball comedy with the nonstop energy of a Post-Modern pastiche."
3351,scotland-pa-movie,Keith Phipps,30,"Shakespeare hasn't had it this rough since Lemmy from Motörhead performed the opening soliloquy in ""Tromeo And Juliet."""
3352,the-disappearance-of-eleanor-rigby-them-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,"At the very least, this implausible trifecta displays an abundantly talented new filmmaker who has risked everything, including the prospect that we may get sick of him immediately. If you care about the remaining possibilities of American movies, then this one – well, one of the three, anyway! – is a must-see."
3353,33-postcards-movie,Chuck Bowen,0,Pauline Chan's film is a jumbled mixture of redemptive uplift and genre hijinks.
3354,the-perfect-holiday-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"You want to make lemonade from this, but even the lemons stink."
3355,pitch-black-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"Between the tart dialogue, the compelling lead performances, the vivid violence and the stunning cinematography, it's complete and satisfying all on its own."
3356,49-up-movie,Carina Chocano,80,49 Up is more than a deeply satisfying movie; it's a reminder of the wonder contained in ordinary lives.
3357,swept-away-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,Even camp status eludes this tepid and misguided picture.
3358,obvious-child-movie,Marc Mohan,83,"Politics aside, Obvious Child hinges on Slate's performance, which is endearing and real."
3359,eight-below-movie,Ann Hornaday,80,"Although the dogs have surely been Disney-fied to some extent, the sequences of them trying to survive are magnificent and deeply moving. Bring the Kleenex, and hug your pups when you get home."
3360,knocked-up-movie,Peter Rainer,83,Sweep aside the gross-outs and you've got the family values comedy of the year.
3361,frailty-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,75,"Against all odds in heaven and hell, it creeped me out just fine."
3362,welcome-to-mooseport-movie,Nathan Rabin,30,"Hackman makes a plausible ex-president, but his graceful, lived-in performance is just about the only element of Welcome To Mooseport that rings true."
3363,bad-education-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,It's a film noir that grows more potent as its secrets are revealed.
3364,untitled-rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-sequel-movie,Richard Corliss,70,"When it gets going, it’s a pretty fine movie."
3365,batman-begins-movie,Manohla Dargis,90,"Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director who takes his material seriously and to a star who shoulders that seriousness with ease."
3366,thirteen-days-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,100,"A terrifically engrossing war film in which not a single shot is fired, a movie about shaping events rather than being shaped by them."
3367,men-cry-bullets-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,The race is on for worst film of the year honors. Among the top contenders: Men Cry Bullets.
3368,flags-of-our-fathers-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,100,"Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers does a most difficult and brave thing and does it brilliantly. It is a movie about a concept. Not just any concept but the shop-worn and often wrong-headed idea of ""heroism."""
3369,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,Russ Fischer,75,"Abrams makes big decisions and takes chances that command respect, especially in the very safe current tentpole film industry, but he doesn’t always quite sell them as he could. Still, as this new chapter props the franchise back up on sturdy legs, the Force seems to be in capable hands with a fresh forward direction."
3370,lilya-4-ever-movie,J. Hoberman,80,"Forget ""Irreversible,"" this is the season's most piercingly feel-bad movie. "
3371,slackers-movie,Patrick Z. McGavin,12,"Not only is Slackers painfully bad, but it's also about as morally unpleasant as a teen sex comedy can be."
3372,the-revenant-2015-movie,Stephen Whitty ,80,"That grim realism sometimes makes The Revenant about as appetizing as a three-course meal of turkey jerky — but also serious enough to remind you of classics like ""Jeremiah Johnson"" and ""Little Big Man."" It's a gruesome adventure story that rarely lets up."
3373,joyful-noise-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Latifah, a formidable actress who's almost always better than her movies, easily dominates this hokey cross between ""Glee'' and ""Sister Act.''"
3374,thin-ice-movie,Nick Schager,38,"The icy fatalism of film noir is turned to slush by Thin Ice, a crime saga that reduces its chosen genre to a series of atonal, old-hat clichés."
3375,7-days-in-entebbe-movie,Roger Moore,38,"7 Days in Entebbe is a blasé stroll through a desperate and harrowing affair, inspiring more boredom than fear and utterly lacking in suspense."
3376,careful-what-you-wish-for-movie,John DeFore,30,"Jonas is, it should be said, the most likeable thing about this watered-down noir."
3377,under-the-skin-movie,Ed Gonzalez,100,"Throughout, what truly matters to director Jonathan Glazer is articulating through visual and aural enticement the unconscious power of our death drive."
3378,war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie,Soren Andersen,75,"Serkis again proves that in the highly specialized realm of performance-capture acting, he has no peer."
3379,seabiscuit-movie,Michael Sragow,100,"Seabiscuit revives the sweeping pleasures of movies that address and respect the mass audience, raising the common denominator instead of pandering to it. This crowd-pleaser rouses honest and engulfing cheers."
3380,basic-instinct-movie,Jay Scott,0,"A perverse, lame-brained thriller that is pornographic, misogynist and homophobic. If that makes it sound appealing, I should also add that it's silly, boring and intellectually insulting."
3381,thomas-and-the-magic-railroad-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,Skin-crawlingly awful.
3382,the-ornithologist-movie,Justin Chang,100,"The Ornithologist” is both an opaque narrative and a deeply inviting one. Even as the film commences a series of radical formal and dramatic mutations, you are held rapt by the steadiness of the camera’s gaze and the sublime, sun-dappled beauty that it invariably discovers."
3383,le-havre-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"For the right kind of film buff, it's absolutely one of the most enjoyable pictures of the year - and if you've never heard of the guy before, I can't imagine a better place to start."
3384,the-sitter-movie,Rick Groen,38,"Add up these three intentions – the down-and-dirty tone, the tender and uplifting message, the starring vehicle – and the math ain't funny. Bottom line: This movie is a whole lot less than the sum of its parts."
3385,the-ring-two-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Perfunctory, thrill- free sequel."
3386,the-man-in-the-iron-mask-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"The problem with this movie is that Wallace has attempted to squeeze a 500-page book into a 130-minute motion picture, something that can't be done without major sacrifices."
3387,never-die-alone-movie,Michael Sragow,25,"Most of the film simply wallows in gangsta hyperbole - it's all bling bling, bang bang."
3388,the-cabin-in-the-woods-movie,Keith Phipps,91,"It's an exercise in metafiction that, while providing grisly fun, never distances viewers. And it's entertaining, while asking the same question of viewers and characters alike: Why come to a place you knew all along was going to be so dark and dangerous?"
3389,puerto-ricans-in-paris-movie,Clayton Dillard,38,The film simply limps to predetermined truths that hypocritically advocate the maintenance of placid family values.
3390,how-to-lose-friends-alienate-people-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,Weide's big-screen version is sitcom-drab.
3391,swordfish-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"The cinema of morons made by morons for morons, Swordfish is everything you expect but worse."

3393,the-mod-squad-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,Bound to wind up as one of 1999's worst films.
3394,elektra-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,What it suffers from most is the sense of offhand storytelling that lies halfway between creative laziness and cost-cutting sloppiness.
3395,k-19-the-widowmaker-movie,Connie Ogle,63,"Despite its exciting moments, the film is too long."
3396,phantom-thread-movie,Moira Macdonald,100,"Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread casts a remarkable spell; it wraps around you, like a delicately scented cashmere shawl woven from music and color and astonishing faces."
3397,freddy-got-fingered-movie,Robert K. Elder,0,Bad decision after bad decision occurs over 93 minutes.
3398,mr-death-the-rise-and-fall-of-fred-a-leuchter-jr-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,"Fred Leuchter is just one deluded figure, but by the end of this great and chilling sick-joke documentary he stands as a living icon of the banality of evil."
3399,magic-in-the-moonlight-movie,Betsy Sharkey,70,"The séances are great fun, and the cast is charmingly eclectic. But as to whether ""Moonlight"" is magical — it is, but ever, ever so slightly."
3400,the-layover-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,20,"The movie’s notion of fun comes to involve an unclean rest stop, slipped pills and an eminently foreseeable conclusion."
3401,kill-me-three-times-movie,Kyle Smith,25,A circle of lowlifes gradually kill one another off to no great effect in the dull and woebegone comic noir Kill Me Three Times.
3402,the-peacemaker-movie,Todd McCarthy,30,"An uncommonly dour and even grim action thriller that globetrots as diversely as a James Bond film but offers a very limited view politically, emotionally and dramatically."
3403,never-let-me-go-movie,Amy Biancolli,75,"Never Let Me Go is gorgeous. And depressing. It's exquisitely acted. And depressing. It's romantic, profound and superbly crafted, shot with the self-contained radiance of a snow globe. And it's depressing."
3404,the-measure-of-a-man-movie,Farran Smith Nehme,88,"French director Stéphane Brizé films in lingering takes, with Lindon in almost every shot, and the actor is wonderful, able to convey Thierry’s conflict even when his back is to the camera."
3405,gone-girl-movie,Drew McWeeny,91,"Gone Girl is not Fincher's best film, nor is it the most conventionally satisfying of them, but it feels like this is a movie that represents the very best that Hollywood craft can offer at the moment."
3406,the-manson-family-movie,V.A. Musetto,75,See it - if you dare. 
3407,backdraft-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"A noisy, impenetrable and totally nonsensical cogitation on the nature of firefighters and the sizzling ""animal"" they love...We just wish somebody would call 911 for boredom."
3408,red-dragon-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"To my surprise, Ratner does a sure, stylish job, appreciating the droll humor of Lecter's predicament, creating a depraved new villain in the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes), and using the quiet, intense skills of Norton to create a character whose old fears feed into his new ones. There is also humor, of the uneasy he-can't-get-away-with-this variety, in the character of a nosy scandal-sheet reporter (Philip Seymour Hoffman)."
3409,anonymous-2011-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,80,Tremendously entertaining. 
3410,children-of-men-movie,Peter Travers,88,Cuarón has a gift only the greatest filmmakers share: He makes you believe.
3411,your-name-movie,Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,91,"Your Name is the kind of film that’s all the more striking for how easily it could have gone awry, but Shinkai has accomplished something unique and genuinely special here."
3412,exists-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"The creature’s big reveal is masterfully handled and a final revelation is exceptionally memorable, but the characters, unsurprisingly, remain interchangeable with those of any number of other teens-in-peril pics. "
3413,white-house-down-movie,Mary Pols,70,What makes White House Down not just tolerable but frivolously entertaining is its slapstick soul; a scene where the presidential limousine does doughnuts on the South Lawn plays like an homage to the Keystone Kops.
3414,ponyo-movie,Alan Niester,75,"In short, it's very much a charming kids' film, created by a master of animation."
3415,le-cercle-rouge-re-release-movie,Scott Foundas ,90,Melville seems to peer out from behind the camera with a reassuring wink and nod. Le Cercle Rouge is the most self-consciously cool of his famously underheated films noirs. 
3416,a-glimpse-inside-the-mind-of-charles-swan-iii-movie,Stephen Holden,30,For all its visual pizazz A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III has the jerky momentum of a collection of disconnected skits loosely thrown together with only the vaguest notion of where it’s heading or what it all means. At best it is a mildly diverting goof with a charmless lead performance. Its underlying misogyny leaves a sour taste.
3417,shower-movie,Kevin Thomas,80,Beguiling and poignant.
3418,gladiator-movie,Cody Clark,84,"Combining a seething physicality with enough weary nobility and tightly checked rage for a dozen wronged heroes, (Crowe) provides the movie's vital center of gravity without looming over his co-stars."
3419,once-upon-a-time-in-the-midlands-movie,Jami Bernard,38,"After 45 minutes of incomparable boredom, the movie gets slightly better when it stops reaching for cheap yuks and lets the actors do what they do well. "
3420,my-big-fat-greek-wedding-2-movie,Peter Travers,25,What once bubbled up from a sincere love of Greek family has now congealed into the all-too-familiar Hollywood tale of  milking a cash cow until cries for mercy.
3421,looper-movie,Noel Murray,91,"Looper is a remarkable feat of imagination and execution, entertaining from start to finish, even as it asks the audience to contemplate how and why humanity keeps making the same rotten mistakes. "
3422,the-peacemaker-movie,Peter Rainer,30,"It's big and loud, but this Peacemaker is still a dud."
3423,sophies-choice-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Sophie's Choice is a fine, absorbing, wonderfully acted, heartbreaking movie."
3424,phoebe-in-wonderland-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,"Phoebe in Wonderland happens to be at least partly a Lifetime movie, but this special little film is no disease-of-the-week tear-jerker."
3425,sita-sings-the-blues-movie,Ty Burr,88,"The film, dazzling and poignant and five years in the making, retells the ancient Indian epic ""The Ramayana"" from a gentle but insistent feminist perspective."
3426,blame-it-on-rio-movie,Pauline Kael,10,Travel-folder footage of Rio mixed with father-daughter incest (in a disguised form)...Most of the movie is an attempt to squirm out from under its messy erotic-parental subject.
3427,serving-sara-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"Romantic screwball comedies are supposed to be at least a little romantic, but there's no chemistry between Perry and Hurley."
3428,winchester-movie,Matt Glasby,20,"For all their technical competence, the Spierig brothers don’t show great understanding of how ghost stories actually work. "
3429,a-separation-movie,Scott Tobias,100,"Beyond the impeccable performances and direction, it's foremost an exceptional piece of screenwriting, so finely wrought that the drama seems guided by an invisible hand. "
3430,down-by-law-movie,Rita Kempley,90,"There's so much to see and imagine, so many twists left to ponder in such a complicated and multi-layered tale. The temptation -- and some of the fun -- is to analyze Down By Law to death, to chew on it. Hyper-intellectualizing aside, it's pure pleasure for comedy connoisseurs. "
3431,anchorman-the-legend-of-ron-burgundy-movie,Eric Campos,100,"Full force Will Ferrell at his best. And as an added bonus, we all get one of the funniest movies of the year...that is if you don't mind your humor on the rude and crude side. "
3432,beyond-the-hills-movie,Sheri Linden,80,"With its long takes and deliberate pacing, Beyond the Hills is demanding but always engrossing, even during its repetitive middle section."
3433,the-avengers-movie,James Berardinelli,25,This film is an absolute mess.
3434,the-5th-wave-movie,Rex Reed,0,The 5th Wave is a typical example of the kind of dopey junk that passes for literature among today’s unsophisticated teens.
3435,girlfight-movie,Kenneth Turan,80,A powerful and empathetic melodrama with feminist underpinnings.
3436,cecil-b-demented-movie,Robert Horton,70,"A small, scruffy, but agreeably energized comedy."
3437,videodrome-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"The characters are bitter and hateful, the images are nauseating, and the ending is bleak enough that when the screen fades to black it's a relief.. Videodrome, whatever its qualities, has got to be one of the least entertaining films of all time."
3438,the-way-movie,Claudia Puig,75,"Unafraid of stillness and scenes of quiet contemplation, the film also celebrates companionship and community, which are all good reasons to embrace the experience along The Way."
3439,surviving-christmas-movie,David Ansen,10,The folks who served up this formulaic swill seem to think comedy grants you a free pass from credibility. Our lonely hero's artificial Yuletide enthusiasm is more than odd: it's not recognizably human.
3440,stories-we-tell-movie,Eric Kohn,100,Stories We Tell marks the finest of Polley's filmmaking skills by blending intimacy and intrigue to remarkable effect.
3441,the-sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-movie,Connie Ogle,63,The cast brings its by-the-numbers characters alive.
3442,the-blackcoats-daughter-movie,Leslie Felperin,90,"As with so many of the best mystery-horror films, the optimum way to enjoy a first viewing of this is try to remain as ignorant as possible about what happens. That said, it also brims with tiny, blink-and-you'll-miss-them details that will repay repeat viewings."
3443,the-purge-election-year-movie,Amy Nicholson,67,"DeMonaco makes small choices I admire. For once, no woman gets threatened with rape. Instead, ladies seem to be the aggressors, and as we cruise the streets of D.C. we see wives stabbing and incinerating husbands, or dancing around a tree strung with male corpses. "
3444,snow-day-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,Even Snow Day's winter wonderland looks fake.
3445,frozen-river-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,"There is no shortage of indie movies about economically challenged women. This one is different, in that the women actually do something besides just talk about it."
3446,rebel-in-the-rye-movie,Jordan Ruimy,67,There seems to be something missing; his life was an enigmatic puzzle and Strong hasn’t found all the pieces. It doesn’t help that his visual style is flat and the narrative is conventional enough.
3447,bad-boys-ii-movie,G. Allen Johnson,70,"It may be the most winning, smile-inducing Hollywood action flick of the summer. "
3448,the-end-of-the-tour-movie,Rodrigo Perez,83,"Intimate, soul-baring, and winning, The End Of The Tour is a special, lovely little gem."
3449,jiminy-glick-in-lalawood-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"Jiminy Glick needs definition if he's to work as a character. We have to sense a consistent comic personality, and we don't; Short changes gears and redefines the character whenever he needs a laugh."
3450,code-black-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,90,"Slicing through the fat of policy debates to the visceral rush of critical care, the narrative combines existential worries... and blood-and-guts immediacy with a seamlessness that made me want to high-five the editor, Joshua Altman."
3451,leave-no-trace-movie,Alissa Wilkinson,90,"Leave No Trace is the story of a bond between a teenage daughter and her veteran father, but in the background is another kind of bond, something that keeps the world from spinning apart. That’s Granik’s subject, and Leave No Trace explores it simply but unforgettably."
3452,13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi-movie,Blake Goble,0,"Shots are short, oddly made, and shoddily smashed together. There’s no spatial continuity, let alone consistency in time of day, or even a care for any kind of visual coherence. 13 Hours is just chaos. It’s unwatchable, unlikable, and unworthy of respect."
3453,the-rolling-stones-charlie-is-my-darling---ireland-1965-movie,Ronnie Scheib,90,"The kinetically shot concert footage captures the volatile dynamic between performers and audience, as Mick Jagger's provocative posturing is followed by fans storming the stage. "
3454,snow-dogs-movie,Marc Savlov,0,The marketing weasels over at Disney deserve to have their beady little eyes gouged out with flaming icicles for the fast one they've pulled on audiences with Snow Dogs.
3455,serving-sara-movie,John Patterson,10,"All Serving Sara can offer is Perry with his arm shoulder-deep up a longhorn steer's backside, a wasted supporting cast that includes Vincent Pastore and Cedric the Entertainer, and a huge, comedian-shaped hole where Hurley's performance should be."
3456,how-to-survive-a-plague-movie,Dennis Harvey,90,"A concise overview's clarity and an epic narrative shape, with a happy ending to boot."
3457,jodorowskys-dune-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"Frank Pavich’s fun documentary captures an unbowed, exuberant Jodorowsky, who recalls his team of “spiritual warriors” with the camaraderie of a battle-scarred veteran. "
3458,life-in-a-day-movie,Andrew Schenker,12,"Only a few snippets escape the uncritical narcissism that the film celebrates and, despite their unimaginative employment, they stand as something of a rebuke to the film's dominant images."
3459,sicario-movie,Gregory Ellwood,83,"Sicario starts and ends with Blunt’s impassioned performance (and she's spectacular in her final scene), but it’s Del Toro who is the real standout. "
3460,they-came-together-movie,Christy Lemire,38,"Means to make fun of romantic comedies the way ""Airplane!"" goofed on disaster movies and the ""Naked Gun"" films spoofed detective flicks. The result is actually more in line with Gus Van Sant’s ambitious but ill-advised shot-for-shot remake of ""Psycho.""  "
3461,la-promesse-the-promise-movie,Frank Scheck,80,"The visual style and the natural, unaffected performances by a talented cast help create an atmosphere of verisimilitude that makes the story all the more powerful. [23 Oct. 1996]"
3462,love-1969-movie,Ella Taylor,90,"At his provocative best, though - in his brilliant, gorgeous 2009 film ""The White Ribbon,"" a study of the roots of fascism in domestic tyranny, and now in Amour - Haneke implicates us in the full range of human capacity."
3463,the-people-vs-larry-flynt-movie,Rita Kempley,100,Enormously entertaining and surprisingly touching.
3464,a-dogs-purpose-movie,Josh Kupecki,11,A misguided and utterly tone-deaf Hallmark card to the canis lupus familiaris and the people who love them.
3465,midnight-run-movie,David Sterritt,75,"Grodin is brilliant, though, practically stealing the movie without an extra word or unnecessary gesture. He's an uncommonly talented actor, and it's good to see him in a movie that gives him a chance to show his stuff. [22 July 1988]"
3466,soapdish-movie,Rick Groen,75,"This broad farce about a group of soap-opera stars is played at a hysterical pitch, but there are some real chuckles amid the mayhem. [31 May 1991]"
3467,great-expectations-2013-movie,Claudia Puig,75,"It's an oft-told tale, but director Mike Newell's handsome version of Charles Dickens' epic novel is marked by strong performances, well-developed characters and gorgeous cinematography."
3468,almost-peaceful-movie,Ella Taylor,80,"Modest, wise ensemble piece."
3469,life-as-a-house-movie,Rene Rodriguez,63,Makes for a compelling comedy-drama about family ties. It's only when the cancer takes center stage that the movie feels like a wash.
3470,twice-born-movie,Christy Lemire,38,"Yes, it's all as clunky and tasteless as the description suggests, and the awkward casting doesn't improve this overlong drama."
3471,the-mexican-movie,Shawn Levy,75,"For a Hollywood studio movie, you see, The Mexican is remarkably strange and eccentric with a plot like a wrinkled bed sheet and a black comic sensibility that consistently swerves away from the cliches that have been established in this Age of Tarantino."
3472,alice-through-the-looking-glass-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,0,"I removed my eyeballs from my head as soon as I got back from Alice Through the Looking Glass and cleaned them in a sink. I could have left them in and only cleaned the fronts, but I didn't want to take any chances."
3473,captain-underpants-the-first-epic-movie-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,"Captain Underpants is a very popular book series that doesn’t seamlessly translate to the big screen, and the filmmakers can’t solve this problem. The result is a cinematic wedgie: a little too dark, a little too nihilistic, a little too empty."
3474,leviathan-2014-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"It's a small story set in a memorably desolate location. The actors, all quite magnificent, enlarge it, just as cinematographer Mikhail Krichman illuminates the vistas and roadways and even the furtive kitchen table glances between clandestine lovers."
3475,the-big-short-movie,Jeff Baker,91,"A highly entertaining, informative movie about how the subprime mortgage crisis led to a worldwide financial meltdown in 2007-08. The fact that such a movie is so unusual is one big reason why the meltdown occurred and why it easily could happen again."
3476,x2-x-men-united-movie,Dana Stevens,70,"Mr. Singer and his collaborators grasp that comic books, for all their obligatory fights and explosions, are at bottom about their brave, troubled, impossibly muscled characters."
3477,les-destinees-movie,Ron Stringer,90,An exquisite metaphor for the high cost and higher returns of an enduring marriage.
3478,toy-story-2-movie,Tom Keogh,90,"So funny and smart that holding it up against its predecessor is as pointless as comparing peak episodes of ""Seinfeld."""
3479,hansel-and-gretel-witch-hunters-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"In his English-language debut, Wirkola dabbles in everything but commits to nothing, making for an unmemorable brew best left untasted."
3480,random-hearts-movie,Edward Guthmann,25,"Hollywood hit-making at its efficient, formulaic worst."
3481,the-banger-sisters-movie,Wesley Morris,25,"The Banger Sisters so frequently features Hawn running around in revealing attire, tossing instructions at exhausted people that I'm inclined to think of it as a workout video."
3482,prefontaine-movie,Gary Kamiya,70,"This is filmmaking in a higher-IQ Disney style, frequently verging on terminal sappiness, all heart-quickening-guitar-music, coming-around-the-last-turn, legs-pumping-toward-glory stuff."
3483,bless-the-child-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,The movie is somewhat below average. The plot doesn't always hold together.
3484,insidious-chapter-3-movie,Peter Keough,38,"There’s no end in sight, and that’s what’s really insidious."
3485,october-sky-movie,Stephen Hunter,80,"It makes a great point: Love, honor and respect your father, but then get the hell out of town."
3486,license-to-wed-movie,James Berardinelli,25,"This movie is bad from top to bottom, front to back, and start to finish."
3487,romance-movie,Manohla Dargis,70,"There's never been a movie director like Catherine Breillat, a fearless visionary and one hell of a woman."
3488,taxi-2015-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"Taxi is a subversive piece of underground filmmaking; for all its lighthearted banter and formal playfulness, the film maintains an undercurrent of anxiety and danger."
3489,footprints-movie,V.A. Musetto,12,"Peros probably intends Footprints to be an homage to Hollywood's Golden Age. But the script's so incoherent and the acting so amateurish that it makes the worst old-time Hollywood B-flick seem like ""Citizen Kane."""
3490,beyond-the-mat-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"Frighteningly, grippingly real."
3491,the-hunger-games-catching-fire-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,Catching Fire is smoothly exciting but a bit of a tease.
3492,man-of-the-year-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Man of the Year remains an interesting proposition throughout, and a tale well told."
3493,tammy-movie,Rex Reed,0,"Tammy is not just a celebration of everything vulgar and stupid in the dumbing down of American movies. It’s a rambling, pointless and labored attempt to cash in on Ms. McCarthy’s fan base without respect for any audience with a collective IQ of 10. And it’s about as funny as a liver transplant."
3494,southbound-movie,Daniel Schindel,0,"The movie shifts gears with each section.... This hodgepodge encourages some variety in the world-building, but, to the littlest detail, it’s derivative — and, worse, not scary."
3495,the-dirty-dozen-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"There are some nice, amusing scenes, especially when one of the dozen (Donald Sutherland) pretends to be a general and inspects some troops. In fact, right up to the last scene the movie is amusing, well paced, intelligent."
3496,shopgirl-movie,Peter Travers,75,"Even the film's missteps (the score, by Barrington Pheloung, is cringe-inducing) can't stop this meditation on love -- Martin calls it ""Jane Austen for the twenty-first century"" -- from melting into heartbreak."
3497,death-of-a-nation-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"In Death of a Nation, Dinesh D’Souza is no longer preaching to the choir; he’s preaching to the mentally unsound. That’s how detached from reality his “philosophy,” his armchair rage, and his passionate and consuming desire to be a radical-right shill have become."
3498,the-shape-of-water-movie,Rex Reed,25,"The more I try to find some kind of justifiable meaning and relevance, the more I find The Shape of Water a loopy, lunkheaded load of drivel. Not as stupid and pointless as that other critically overrated piece of junk ""Get Out,"" but determined to go down trying. I call this one ""Maudie Meets the Creature From the Black Lagoon."""
3499,waltz-with-bashir-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"The film ends on an absolutely sick-making note, with live-action footage of the massacre and its aftermath."
3500,the-program-movie,Andrew Lowry,80,This fearless reconstruction drives home the dark lie that Lance Armstrong lived – it’s just a pity it doesn’t dig a little deeper.
3501,tickled-movie,Chris Nashawaty,91,"David Farrier and Dylan Reeve’s documentary Tickled is so crazy that it feels like a hoax. Only it’s not. At least, I don’t think it is."
3502,the-next-best-thing-movie,Dennis Lim,10,"A vanity project -- hell-bent on playing barely human characters as themselves, they've created something quitebewilderingly ugly in the process."
3503,the-crime-of-father-amaro-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,"A feverish melodrama about an idealist who, in following his heart and his bishop's orders, leads himself into temptation and his parish into hypocrisy."
3504,sarah-palin-you-betcha!-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"Recalling the lesson about bringing a knife to a gun fight, a British documentary filmmaker brings a spoon to a hatchet job in the film Sarah Palin: You Betcha!"
3505,letters-to-juliet-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"She delivers a solid and easy star performance. Some young performers lack a relatable quality; Seyfried has it, even with those old-school, big-screen peepers."
3506,the-gospel-according-to-andre-movie,Katie Walsh,80,"It's a rare delight to spend so much time with the inimitable André. This revealing documentary shows the playful, loving and vulnerable side to this towering figure of taste."
3507,down-to-earth-movie,Desmond Ryan,63,What Rock fans will sorely miss in Down to Earth is the earthiness and outrageous hilarity of his stand-up act.
3508,carol-movie,A.O. Scott,100,"At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, Carol is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros. With sparse dialogue and restrained drama, the film is a symphony of angles and glances, of colors and shadows."
3509,entourage-movie,Ann Hornaday,12,"Piven is so in the pocket as the smarmy, aggressive, inappropriate Ari that, when the movie he’s in does little more than double down on the bro-ing out, the whiffed opportunities become all the more obvious."
3510,the-invention-of-lying-movie,Joe Williams,63,"This topsy-turvy flick is fitfully funny, but more often it's just odd, like the first draft of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode that's missing its moral."
3511,seven-movie,Staff(not credited),90,"This weirdly off-kilter suspenser goes well beyond the usual police procedural or killer-on-a-rampage yarn due to a fine script, striking craftsmanship and a masterful performance by Morgan Freeman."
3512,39-pounds-of-love-movie,Ty Burr,63,"'39 Pounds of Love is a heartwarmer that looks away from darker, deeper, and more troubling matters."
3513,the-animal-movie,Larry Worth,25,"Through it all, Rob Schneider comes off as a jackass in The Animal."
3514,view-from-the-top-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,"The damn thing is boring. Dull as dirt. Despite the many fine actors involved, View From the Top is a third-class production through and through and, frankly, I'd rather be pelted in the head with stale, salty peanuts than sit through it again. "
3515,son-of-the-bride-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,"A drama of rare distinction, and wonderfully funny in the bargain."
3516,vegas-vacation-movie,Jack Mathews,0,There is nothing more memorable about Vegas Vacation than the flatness of the writing in Elisa Bell's script and the uninspired direction of first-timer Stephen Kessler.
3517,the-prestige-movie,Maitland McDonagh,88,"The film's prestige is a doozy, both dazzling and preposterous, but if you're watching closely -- as Cutter advises in the film's first few minutes -- it's flawlessly set up."
3518,a-ghost-story-movie,Michael Phillips,100,"David Lowery's film A Ghost Story is best seen a second time, though obeying the customary rules of time and cinema, you'll have the mysterious pleasure of seeing it a first time to get there."
3519,the-year-my-parents-went-on-vacation-movie,M. E. Russell,83,"A sweet, intelligent little movie."
3520,nobodys-fool-movie,Lawrence Toppman,88,"Some writer-directors would have squeezed pathos from this story until the corn turned to pone, especially in a post-Christmas release. Writer-director Robert Benton (Places in the Heart) keeps a gentler grip on the proceedings and makes 10 times the impact. [13 Jan 1995, p.1F]"
3521,message-in-a-bottle-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,"On paper, the movie sounds unbearably schlocky, but Costner plays Garret the reluctant backcountry prince as mythic but also foxy and life size."
3522,love-after-love-movie,Jonah Jeng,83,"In joy as well as in pain, life is both momentous and mundane. Love After Love gets this, and as a result, it feels like truth."
3523,american-outlaws-movie,Desson Thomson,0,There's no escaping the hackneyed plot or Mayfield's conventional hand. So don't go.
3524,bucky-larson-born-to-be-a-star-movie,Nathan Rabin,16,"Apparently no one told Ricci she was acting in a comedy, not a touching drama about a young woman overcoming a formative trauma to achieve her dreams."
3525,the-return-2004-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"This is nobody's idea of a happy family story, but it is a pristinely chilling depiction of familial meltdown in a post-Stalinist, Twilight Zone anti-place, the dark heart of heartlessness and mysterious parenting techniques. "
3526,the-good-dinosaur-movie,Joe Walsh,100,"The Good Dinosaur is up there with Toy Story in terms of its technical achievement and for providing an equally heart-touching, emotional tale."
3527,collateral-beauty-movie,Peter Travers,0,The unholy mess that director David Frankel and screenwriter Allan Loeb have unleashed for the holidays strands an all-star cast...on a sinking ship that churns the waters from absurd to zombified with frequent stops at pretentious.
3528,aint-them-bodies-saints-movie,Ty Burr,63,"It’s a secondhand vision, when all is said and done, but that doesn’t have to be a bad thing when the craft is rapturous."
3529,the-running-man-movie,Vincent Canby,70,"Has the manners and the gadgetry of a sci-fi adventure film but is, at heart, an engagingly mean, cruel, nasty, funny send-up of television. It's not quite Network, but then it also doesn't take itself too seriously."
3530,in-the-name-of-the-father-movie,Terrence Rafferty,90,"The picture turns into a kind of stylized morality play about the right and the wrong ways for Irishmen to respond to distorted portraits of their character, and it's terrifically effective."
3531,hare-krishna!-the-mantra-the-movement-and-the-swami-who-started-it-all-movie,David Lewis,25,"It’s so uncritical of its subject that it has the unintended effect of undermining its mission, which appears to be recruiting new devotees of the faith."
3532,vacation-2015-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,The geniuses behind the new film just don’t understand the difference between genuine subversiveness and pointless vulgarity.
3533,running-scared-movie,Carina Chocano,0,"Running Scared is so desperate and surreally stupid that all you would have to do to see it as a brilliant sendup of everything that is corrupt, vulgar, sad, deluded and bad-for-you about Hollywood is squint."
3534,food-inc-movie,Kyle Smith,38,The movie offers very little that food radicals don't already know.
3535,polisse-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,"The mosaic of cases and caseworkers is like a season of ""The Wire"" distilled into two hours."
3536,the-raid-redemption-movie,Ty Burr,88,"Poised at the midway point between an ultraviolent video game and a neo-classic dance musical. As midnight-movie mash-ups go, it's pretty amazing."
3537,unforgivable-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"Among other things, Unforgivable is a free-floating meditation on the distresses and exhilarations of being a parent. "
3538,the-cove-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,100,"What's so remarkable about Louie Psihoyos' documentary The Cove isn't just that it's a powerful work of agitprop that's going to have you sending furious e-mails to the Japanese Embassy on your way out of the theater. That's definitely true, but the effectiveness of The Cove also comes from its explosive cinematic craft, its surprising good humor and its pure excitement."
3539,a-cinderella-story-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"It is horrible. Time curls up and dies while this Hilary Duff vehicle wheels its weary, conventional way along."
3540,wonderland-2000-movie,Steven Rea,88,"A crushingly sad, beautiful film."
3541,bright-star-movie,Roger Ebert,88,What Campion does is seek visual beauty to match Keats' verbal beauty. There is a shot here of Fanny in a meadow of blue flowers that is so enthralling it beggars description.
3542,potiche-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,75,An Orson Welles-size Gérard Depardieu does gallant work as the town's leftist mayor.
3543,our-lady-of-the-assassins-movie,Roger Ebert,88,The film's title is appropriate. A desperate Catholicism flavors the doomed city.
3544,monsieur-ibrahim-movie,William Arnold,83,"A gracefully subtle, sweet-spirited French parable of the brotherhood of man that was nominated for a Golden Globe, won Omar Sharif a César Award for best actor and has been a surprise hit in Europe."
3545,the-purge-the-island-movie,Richard Whittaker,67,"So four episodes in, and The Purge franchise is as nakedly provocative as ever."
3546,just-my-luck-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"In the end, I can't think of a movie that matters less than Just My Luck. It's just negligible."
3547,down-to-earth-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"Penned by Rock and a handful of his pals, is such an utter disaster it seems to go out of its way to avoid comedy. It's the very definition of oxymoron: a crowd-pleaser that doesn't."
3548,sinister-2-movie,Robert Abele,30,Nothing about Sinister 2 comes close to the feel-bad ode to literally and figuratively dark interiors that distinguished the title-earning original.
3549,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,Robin Rauzi,0,"Compounded by a dated visual style, patched-together special effects and ludicrous dialogue, Battlefield Earth is a wholly miserable experience."
3550,turbo-movie,Drew Taylor,25,"One of the more disappointing big studio animated features this year, a movie can't even muster the energy to be visually engaging, let alone give you anything to care about story-wise. "
3551,when-will-i-be-loved-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,"Toback has hit a new low. The candor and shrugging good humor Toback, at his best, used to show has been replaced by a repellent slurpiness: The whole picture seems coated with a slimy sheen of drool."
3552,tusk-movie,Ed Gonzalez,38,"It suggests the worst possible gene splice of a barbed Terrance and Phillip South Park appearance, Fargo's blithe condescension, and the smuggest of Quentin Tarantino pastiches."
3553,night-catches-us-movie,Melissa Anderson,70,"Writer-director Tanya Hamilton's striking debut is the rare recent American-independent film that goes beyond the private dramas of its protagonists, imagining them as players in broader historical moments. "
3554,the-forest-movie,Steve Davis,11,"The snap of a twig, the rustle of a branch – that’s about as scary as it gets in The Forest, a supernatural horror movie afraid of its own shadow. "
3555,caesar-must-die-movie,Jordan Hoffman,91,"At 76 minutes, Caesar Must Die is more of an art piece than a thick steak of a feature film, but it maintains a fascinating hum from start to finish."
3556,the-memory-of-a-killer-movie,Desson Thomson,80,Belgian actor [Jan] Decleir's tough-guy vulnerability ... gives an otherwise standard police procedural extraordinary grace and power.
3557,now-you-see-me-2-movie,Steve Persall,25,"For their next act, the illusionist con artists from Now You See Me will make every ounce of goodwill that movie earned disappear."
3558,the-emperors-club-movie,Rick Groen,63,Turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach.
3559,hugh-hefner-playboy-activist-and-rebel-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Yet as ridiculous as Hefner's life sometimes seems, he has been an exemplary citizen, as this documentary by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Brigitte Berman spells out."
3560,marauders-movie,Richard Roeper,75,"It’s pulp, but it has real actors doing real acting in a gritty story — which is a lot more than can be said for some of the much more high-profile buddy cop movies of the last couple of years."
3561,the-big-short-movie,Chris Nashawaty,100,"I suppose you could call The Big Short a comedy. It’s very, very funny. But it’s also a tragedy. Behind every easy drive-by laugh is a sincere holler of outrage."
3562,dracula-pages-from-a-virgins-diary-movie,Ken Fox,70,"Dracula fans will appreciate the witty ways in which Maddin has drawn Stoker's troubling racism and xenophobia to the fore, while making the most of the sexual ambivalence that helps make the story endlessly fascinating."
3563,plunkett-macleane-movie,Barbara Shulgasser,38,Scott treats the material as if it were grist for a 30-second spot or a rowdy music video.
3564,soul-power-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,A vibrant and joyous new documentary.
3565,southside-with-you-movie,Dave Calhoun,80,"It’s a small, successful sketch of now-great lives."
3566,survivor-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,16,The filmmaker should perhaps thank his actors for putting in more effort than this movie is worth.
3567,days-of-glory-movie,William Arnold,83,An unusually engrossing World War II epic.
3568,the-samaritan-movie,Eric Hynes,20,"No one expects a Samuel L. Jackson thriller to be Shakespeare, but David Weaver's wanna-be '70s-grindhouse cheapie doesn't even achieve serviceability. "
3569,where-the-heart-is-movie,Kevin Thomas,10,"In comparison to Where the Heart Is, the Wal-Mart commercials seem like cinema verite."
3570,wing-commander-space-will-never-be-the-same-movie,Staff (Not credited),0,"The effects are laughably primitive, the dialogue hilariously atrocious -- and those are the good parts."
3571,america-imagine-a-world-without-her-movie,Roger Moore,38,"What he’s doing, it turns out, is lowering the viewer’s standards of proof for a vigorous return to “2016″ territory, a hatchet job on Obama and Obamacare that tries to tie everything to a 1960s “radical” organizer who might have influenced the president."
3572,dracula-untold-movie,Scott Foundas,30,"Dracula Untold opts for the stately, staid approach, and even at a mere 85 minutes (sans credits) it’s something of a bore — neither scary nor romantic nor exciting in any of the ways it seems to intend."
3573,the-love-punch-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,Manages to be excruciatingly unfunny despite the presence of Pierce Brosnan and Emma Thompson in the lead roles.
3574,generation-wealth-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,"This new film, though, is mainly appalling, and not instructively so. It’s all over the place, to the point of inducing numbness or suffocation. In the end it comes out in favor of love, which is good, but getting there may leave you glassy-eyed, unless you’re deeply into bling porn."
3575,groove-movie,Dan DeLuca,25,"Unfortunately, it lacks a compelling story or characters of any complexity."
3576,whipped-movie,Jay Carr,25,"A crass, witless knockoff of better films."
3577,stolen-summer-movie,Dennis Lim,10,"Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss, it might as well be called ""Pray It Forward."""
3578,the-take-2016-movie,Simon Abrams,25,The Take is just really lousy. 
3579,scooby-doo-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,A work of Battlefield Earth-level miscalculation.

3581,tideland-movie,Ann Hornaday,0,Rarely has an act of such cinematic cruelty as Tideland been perpetrated on filmgoers.
3582,season-of-the-witch-2011-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,Mr. Cage's knight ends up playing second banana to a digital devil. Welcome to the January dead zone.
3583,independence-day-resurgence-movie,Brian Truitt,38,Ridiculousness needs to abound somewhat in a film like this — reality takes a seat early and often here — but Resurgence pushes everything to an egregiously over-the-top and often infuriating degree.
3584,47-meters-down-movie,Derek Smith,38,"Like Lisa and Kate’s pendular swings between hope and despair, Johannes Roberts’s film can’t help alternating between the genuinely terrifying and the just plain dumb. "
3585,jason-x-movie,Robert K. Elder,38,"Jason X conjures up more giggles than scares, assuming you make it through the first 15 minutes."
3586,strange-magic-movie,Justin Chang,20,A thoroughly derivative and unengaging fantasy.
3587,louder-than-words-movie,Nikola Grozdanovic,16,"This is advertisement masquerading as a story, pretending to be a movie, but at the very least, it’s for a good cause."
3588,x-men-movie,Sean Axmaker,83,"Singer deftly crafts a sleek, unusually tight film that balances comic-book adventure, pulp opera and the fear of being different."
3589,the-wood-movie,Liam Lacey,63,"Tilting between a teen sex comedy and a more sensitive tale about male bonding, The Wood is too anxious to please to quite make up its mind what it is."
3590,blood-the-last-vampire-movie,Aaron Hillis,10,"Unexciting, incoherent, lamely acted, and carelessly written."
3591,ghost-dog-the-way-of-the-samurai-movie,Wesley Morris,12,It's too cryptic and unfulfilled to serve as a tool for anything beyond its own obfuscation.
3592,being-elmo-a-puppeteers-journey-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"The greater the illusion the greater the manipulator, and few are as good as Kevin Clash, the subject of Constance Marks's sprightly six-years-in-the-making documentary Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey."
3593,words-and-pictures-movie,Alonso Duralde,30,"Words and Pictures never accrues enough emotional resources to bear out the darker, heavier moments, which turns its big dramatic moves into clunky embarrassments."
3594,august-rush-movie,Andrea Gronvall,30,"Williams's overacting, Russell's pinched melancholy, and Highmore's unflagging chirpiness would be trying enough on their own, but the convoluted story, with its pileup of obstacles and coincidences, makes this sophomore effort by director Kirsten Sheridan (Disco Pigs) an exercise in dissonance."
3595,jackie-movie,Allison Shoemaker,91,"It’s as complex and surprising a character study as any you’ll see this year, a fact made all the more impressive when you remember that the woman in question has been turned into a collectible doll."
3596,my-babys-daddy-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"Reflects poorly on everyone, particularly its makers, its stars, and the studio laboring under the delusion that this stuff was worthy of release."
3597,the-bitter-pill-movie,Ian Freer,80,"We may lose Soderbergh to painting, theatre and HBO-fuelled TV, and that’s a crying shame. If that’s the case, Side Effects is a great note on which to go out. "
3598,on-the-beach-at-night-alone-movie,Eric Kohn,83,"On the Beach at Night Alone is a fascinating sublimation of autobiography into Hong’s precise creative terms, a bittersweet character study as poignant, witty and deceptively slight as much of his work that also refurbishes it with a unique personal dimension."
3599,the-order-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,The picture is so lethargic that I began to think of watching it as a form of atonement.
3600,keeping-up-with-the-joneses-movie,Bilge Ebiri,10,"It’s as if somebody wrote out the basic setup, figured they would flesh out the character bits and plot twists and jokes later … and then never got around to it. It’s dispiriting and infuriating all at once."
3601,all-about-lily-chou-chou-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"The concept was interesting and charming in ""Love Letters,"" up to a point, but here it quickly becomes repetitive, obvious, and dull."
3602,footloose-1984-movie,Staff [Not Credited],30,"Ross, who began his career as a dancer and choreographer, brings plenty of gusto to the material and the performances are ebullient, but this is still a cynical and manipulative exercise with little feel for the teen culture it purports to celebrate."
3603,the-congress-movie,Manohla Dargis,80,"Ari Folman’s genre mash-up The Congress could use a freakier title, something either more appealing or appalling to go with the weird, sometimes wonderful visions flowing through it."
3604,payback-movie,Walter Addiego,25,So it's hard to know who gets the blame for Payback. I say we cut Mel some slack and put the hex on Helgeland.
3605,30-minutes-or-less-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,Gut-bustingly funny -- perhaps this waning summer season's ultimate guilty pleasure.
3606,tarzan-the-ape-man-movie,Staff (Not Credited),0,Just painfully dull.
3607,they-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"At some point, I just tired of looking at all the nicely composed shots unworthy of the stock they're printed on. Lives are at stake here, and I don't mean Julia's and her annoying pals'. I mean the lives of you and me, the only pronouns that really matter here."
3608,games-people-play-new-york-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,10,The film doesn't know what it wants to be -- reality programming pushed to the max or a satire of reality TV? -- but it winds up as an exercise in the rankest sort of cynicism.
3609,lara-croft-tomb-raider-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"It is the perfect modern product: loud, banal, empty, frenzied, plasticized, flavorless, drab, violent in a bloodless way and sexy in a sexless way."
3610,hop-movie,Joe Williams,38,"It's supposed to be sweet, but Hop is a headache waiting to happen."
3611,its-all-gone-pete-tong-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,The mockumentary-style delivery of a serious subject proves to be an unworkable mash-up.
3612,leviathan-2014-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,100,"Leviathan, the fourth feature from Russian director Andrei Zvyagintsev, may be the one true masterpiece of global cinema released in 2014."
3613,the-smurfs-2-movie,Tasha Robinson,20,"The problem with Smurfs 2 isn’t the message, it’s the way the film repeats it so baldly and emphatically that even the youngest kids can get it. Also, the way it surrounds that message with groin-smashing and farting."
3614,first-sunday-movie,Wesley Morris,38,A sorry excuse for a ghetto SOS.
3615,dragonfly-movie,Peter Travers,0,I could puke.
3616,september-dawn-movie,Connie Ogle,38,"Filmmaker Christopher Cain has turned a national tragedy into a teen romance, and not in a grand, entertaining, ""Titanic"" way."
3617,the-master-movie,Emma Dibdin,100,"With potent performers and poetic visuals, Anderson has made the boldest American picture of the year. Its strangeness can be hard to process, but this is a shattering study of the impossibility of recovering the past."
3618,jackie-movie,Rex Reed,100,"Never embroidered or rehearsed, the way so many biopics are, this is a wonderful movie that feels freshly observed, like an uninvited peek through some forbidden White House keyhole, at the woman we called Jackie."
3619,step-into-liquid-movie,Scott Foundas,90,"An awe-inspiring survey of global surf culture, with the power to crush the post-""Gidget"" decades of Hollywood stereotyping of surfers and surfing. "
3620,topsy-turvy-movie,Roger Ebert,100,It is one of the year's best films.
3621,in-good-company-movie,Ty Burr,63,Cheerful and easy to watch but surprisingly inept in the telling.
3622,the-gauntlet-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"The Gauntlet is classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny. It tells a cheerfully preposterous story with great energy and a lot of style, and nobody seems more at home in this sort of action movie than Eastwood. "
3623,restrepo-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,It's doubtful you'll ever see a combat documentary that channels the chaos of war as thoroughly as this one.
3624,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,Desmond Ryan,63,Has the incoherent look of a movie thrown together by a committee whose members weren't on the same page.
3625,the-governess-movie,Ella Taylor,30,As dull to listen to as it is gorgeous to look at.
3626,eight-crazy-nights-movie,Bruce Fretts,0,"You know all that artistic cred Adam Sandler built up with his acclaimed work in ''Punch-Drunk Love''? Well, he flushes it down the crapper with Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights -- the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog ''Rover Dangerfield.''"
3627,the-departed-movie,Ty Burr,88,"When The Departed roars to life, as it does in so many of its scenes, you feel like nobody understands movies -- the delirious highs, the unforgiving moral depths -- as well as this man does. Welcome back, Marty."
3628,rejoice-and-shout-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"The film is a bit too chronological, but its historical reverence is true to gospel's joyful insistence on locating the spiritual in the everyday."
3629,prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"An epic example of muddled storytelling, chintzy excitement and scatter-brained execution."
3630,the-walking-deceased-movie,Nick Schager,0,"There's no more disposable type of comedy than the genre spoof, and no greater example of its general creative worthlessness than The Walking Deceased, an interminable 90-minute goof-off propped up by references to popular zombie-apocalypse fiction. "
3631,goya-in-bordeaux-movie,William Arnold,75,"It assumes considerable knowledge of his life and times. But, with even a little of the familiarity it demands, the movie is something special."
3632,paradise-lost-3-purgatory-movie,Roger Ebert,88,This is one of the most fascinating of all true crime stories.
3633,king-of-california-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"It's as if the star (Douglas) finally gets to integrate all his onscreen personas, all at once."
3634,the-cable-guy-movie,Steven Rea,63,"As The Cable Guy progresses, its psycho-comedic tone gets sicker and its plot more predictable, until, by the end, we may as well be watching Ray Liotta as The Cop From Hell or Marky Mark as The Boyfriend From Hell. It's strictly generic, by the book, and downright exhausting. [14 June 1996, p.03]"
3635,sicko-movie,Simon Crook,80,"Horrifying, heart-breaking, often hilarious - Moore’s latest shock doc is a potent polemic."
3636,the-last-song-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,30,"The title, The Last Song, may be wishful thinking for some, but the best they can probably hope for is the close of the era of Hannah Montana movies."
3637,the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"At its best, Hobbit 2, which carries the subtitle The Desolation of Smaug, invites comparisons to Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" threesome."
3638,promises-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"Superb, Oscar-nominated documentary."
3639,outside-the-law-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"A stiff, unconvincing epic."
3640,whats-your-number-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,"Under the direction of Entourage's Mark Mylod, the movie not only makes cheap sex jokes but looks skanky, too. Lighting, camerawork, and editing are all a slapdash mess, one that further hinders the actors trying their best to get through this failed hookup of a comedy."
3641,pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"This ship has sailed, sank, and not to put too fine a bowsprit on it, sucks."
3642,the-sweeney-movie,Gabe Toro,25,"Up until the very very end (which uncorks a CLASSIC cop cliché that seemed long dead by now), The Sweeney is straight dumb procedural, no chaser. "
3643,victoria-and-abdul-movie,Roger Moore,88,"Start to finish, it’s a bloody delightful romp."
3644,fair-game-movie,Stephen Holden,10,The only heat that rises from the movie is mechanical.
3645,keep-the-river-on-your-right-a-modern-cannibal-tale-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"Story of Tobias Schneebaum, a gay New York artist famous for living with, sleeping with - and, gulp, eating with - cannibals in New Guinea."
3646,testament-of-youth-movie,Kate Erbland,70,"Vikander is the main event here, and if Testament Of Youth is a testament to anything, it’s to her ability to embody great women with grace and battle-ready precision. "
3647,fish-tank-movie,Joe Williams,75,"Fortunately, Fish Tank feeds us more than crumbs and leaves us feeling like we've come up for air."
3648,fathers-day-movie,Keith Phipps,0,"Add to these problems the fact that Fathers' Day is a comedy starring two reputedly hilarious people who don't make you laugh once, and you have a movie that would be great if everything about it weren't terrible. "
3649,28-weeks-later-movie,David Ansen,70,"Where the original gave you something to chew on, the sequel is more interested in chewing on you."
3650,the-way-movie,Steven Rea,75,"A heartfelt project, scrappy and engaging, The Way has its way with audiences despite, not because of, its sentimental excess."
3651,stone-reader-movie,Scott Foundas,90,"A debut of enormous craft, surety and resourcefulness -- a superlative, soul-baring non-fiction work that will generate torrential word-of-mouth among auds lucky enough to catch it."
3652,phantom-thread-movie,Andrew Crump,100,"[Anderson's] unobtrusive aesthetic, calibrated to highlight his actors and, of course, the fashion, belies its deceptive luxuriousness. This is a movie you’ll want to live in for the pure joy of reveling in Anderson’s effortless mastery."
3653,star-trek-first-contact-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"By the time Worf (Michael Dorn), knocking off a slimy attacker, growls a Schwarzeneggerish ''Assimilate this!'' we've already done so, with pleasure."
3654,oz-the-great-and-powerful-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,0,"Don’t be fooled by the smoke and mirrors. There is nothing here that is great, or powerful. Worst of all, there’s nothing here that even feels like Oz."
3655,teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movie,James Rocchi,30,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles isn’t a movie; it’s a brand re-launch that’s going to satisfy stockholders far more than it’s going to entertain the people who paid to watch it. 
3656,burning-blue-movie,Scott Foundas,30,"Bearing a distinctly musty odor confirmed by its 2011 copyright date, this day-and-date Lionsgate pickup never achieves dramatic liftoff."
3657,oceans-movie,Pete Hammond,100,"Narrated by Pierce Brosnan, Oceans is simply amazing at times, a truly remarkable and extraordinary journey under the sea that takes us places we have never been before."
3658,rampage-movie,David Ehrlich,25,"What does Rampage have? No satisfying action beats, no memorable images, and so little to say that it’s virtually impossible to say anything about it in return. It’s not a movie for critics, that much is clear. The problem is that it’s not for anyone else, either."
3659,the-dukes-of-hazzard-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,In stiff competition for the lamest thing ever put on celluloid.
3660,van-helsing-movie,James Berardinelli,12,"There are quite a few unintentionally funny moments, although the overall experience was too intensely painful for me to be able to advocate it as being ""so bad, it's good."" "
3661,encino-man-movie,Hal Hinson,10,"Encino Man, the riotously unhilarious new comedy about a misfit couple of California high school nerds who discover a cave man buried in the back yard, is the kind of movie that gives evolution a bad name."
3662,our-family-wedding-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,"A cringeworthy, unfunny example of a culture-clash romantic comedy."
3663,la-la-land-movie,Rory O'Connor,91,"It’s a twinkling surface examination of how humans try to coordinate their dreams with their reality (a very Hollywood conundrum), but also a celebration of just how wonderful old filmmaking techniques and emotions look and feel on modern L.A. streets."
3664,the-chronicles-of-narnia-the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,90,"If you're a fan of C.S. Lewis' Narnia books, all you need to know is this: Disney has done right by The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It's impossible to imagine it done much better, in fact."
3665,stir-of-echoes-movie,Bob Graham,100,"Stir of Echoes is much more down and dirty (than ""The Sixth Sense""), and the thrills are more visceral."
3666,daredevil-movie,Ed Park,20,"Affleck and impressively amazonian Alias star Jennifer Garner (as the ninjitsu-savvy daughter of a wealthy tycoon) are lankier than ""Spider-Man's"" Maguire and Dunst, which is good if you like lanky, but their relationship substitutes cliché for chemistry."
3667,haunt-movie,Robert Abele,30,"Too often, Carter sacrifices characterization for one more flickery effect or carefully composed shot of moody elegance, then overdoes unlighted interiors to an almost absurd degree."
3668,the-adventures-of-pluto-nash-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"Strands one of the most gifted casts assembled in some time. Sadly, though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear, they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction."
3669,the-transporter-refueled-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,The Transporter Refueled should be put up on blocks.
3670,buck-movie,Steve Persall,100,"Buck is a movie to be revisited again and again, like passages from a satisfying self-help book. Riding experience isn't necessary to realize how extraordinary this man and his calling are."
3671,rounders-movie,Bruce Diones,90,Screenwriters Brian Koppelman and David Levien have given some crackerjack card-shark dialogue to two hot young actors—Matt Damon and Edward Norton—and together with John Dahl's atmospheric direction they've all made a dream of a poker movie.
3672,marilyn-hotchkiss-ballroom-dancing-charm-school-movie,Robert Abele,30,"It's all a treacly, shoddily assembled, underwritten mess."
3673,thirst-street-movie,Noel Murray,83,"Burdge holds the picture together, playing a character who walks a fine line between being sympathetically damaged and terrifyingly loony. "
3674,cool-it-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,63,It is at its best when examining alternative sources of energy and how their development has consistently been thwarted by the energy industry.
3675,evita-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,"In what I saw, Madonna in the title role tries bravely not to buckle under the weight of Stone and Parker's sense of Stalinist monumentality and fails honorably, while the Lloyd Webber music goes on being nonmusical."
3676,cry-the-beloved-country-movie,Leonard Klady,70,"A richly realized piece of Masterpiece Literature, director Darrell James Roodt's Cry, the Beloved Country has an admirable high polish. But more effort could have been made to address its underlying message and provide an emotional punch to equal the book's resonance."
3677,sugar-movie,Todd McCarthy,80,"Sympathetic, genial and exceedingly wholesome, it's a film that, once seen, will permanently and favorably influence the way viewers regard the characters' real-life counterparts."
3678,wanderlust-movie,Rick Groen,25,"Film encyclopedias may beg to differ, the Cahiers du Cinéma might correct me, but, as far as your humble correspondent knows, Wanderlust is the first mainstream movie ever to star a Floppy Prosthetic Penis. "
3679,criminal-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"Jacobs keeps the action moving rapidly and gets solid performances from an ensemble cast, especially the rumpled Reilly."
3680,no-country-for-old-men-movie,Peter Rainer,100,The movie is true to its own fierce vision and it's the better for it. I haven't seen a stronger or better American movie all year.
3681,deliverance-movie,Mark Dinning,100,"The gorgeous backdrop of the film makes the violence and darkness even more disturbing - but this is more than just a horror film. There's real substance in themes, performances and John Boorman's superb direction."
3682,mike-and-dave-need-wedding-dates-2016-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"Witless, soulless, often amateurish and filled with product placements (nice going, Coors), the movie has nothing going for it other than some wasted talent. "
3683,citizen-kane-1941-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,"It is a work of art created for grown people by grown people...Orson Welles treats the audience like a jury, calling up the witnesses, letting them offer the evidence, injecting no opinions of his own. He merely sees that their stories are told with absorbing clarity. Unforgettable are such scenes as the spanning of Kane's first marriage in a single conversation, the silly immensity of the castle halls which echo the flat whines of Susan."
3684,van-helsing-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,A work of staggering stupidity.
3685,go-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"Fast-paced and often witty, but ultimately vapid."
3686,the-good-neighbor-movie,Robert Abele,20,"Any movie that leeches the perverse fun out of illicit voyeurism, then tosses in a grim gotcha of an ending to make everyone feel worse, when the kids’ actions are distasteful enough, is worth avoiding."
3687,wordplay-movie,Nathan Rabin,75,"The film's subjects are almost uniformly likable, self-deprecating, funny, and hyper-verbal, and their peculiar passion for crosswords and the sense of genial camaraderie among buffs proves surprisingly infectious."
3688,you-only-live-twice-movie,Dave Kehr,30,"Tired, poorly paced Bond from 1967, with Sean Connery displaying his discontent. Donald Pleasence's Blofeld has a memorably creepy softness, but that's about it."
3689,spirit-stallion-of-the-cimarron-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"It's an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work, every bit as imperious as Katzenberg's ""The Prince of Egypt"" from 1998."
3690,all-about-steve-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"The screenplay by Kim Barker requires Bullock to behave in an essentially disturbing way that began to wear on me. It begins as merely peculiar, moves on to miscalculation and becomes seriously annoying."
3691,the-darkness-movie,Scott Tobias,30,"At some point in the production process, co-writer/director Greg McLean must have believed he was making John Cassavetes’ “Poltergeist,” but this odd fusion of psychodrama and supernatural hokum gets away from him."
3692,terminator-salvation-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"When Christian Bale allowed himself to play Bruce Wayne in ""Batman Begins,"" he was slumming - and to good effect. But with Terminator Salvation, this ostensibly serious actor takes up residence in the action ghetto, and it's not a good fit."
3693,beauty-and-the-beast-1991-movie,Jay Boyar,80,"Much as I like Beauty and the Beast, I think I would have preferred it if its dark parts had even been darker. The brooding beast is a fascinating character to consider, and his fearsome battle with a vicious pack of wolves is one of the most powerful scenes in the movie."
3694,you-again-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,You Again could be taught at film schools as an example of how not to make a movie. And how not to humiliate veteran actors.
3695,extreme-ops-movie,Hank Sartin,10,"Even the action sequences are poorly executed, with lots of choppy editing meant to conceal the fakery."
3696,mr-hollands-opus-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Richard Dreyfuss, who is sometimes too exuberant, here finds the right tones for Mr. Holland, from youthful cocksureness to the gentle insight of age. His physical transformations over 30 years are always convincing. "
3697,out-of-the-furnace-movie,Liam Lacey,63,"If the downbeat plot is depressingly familiar, it’s partly salvaged by the quality of the performances."
3698,the-tuxedo-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Most indicative of The Tuxedo's mediocrity, however, is the absence of the always entertaining action outtakes that traditionally roll under the end credits of Chan films; here it's all dialogue flubs barely fit for Dick Clark."
3699,crazy-heart-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"Bridges' guileless performance makes this piquant little indie tale of country music, redemption, and the love of a pretty younger woman such a sad-song charmer."
3700,fifty-shades-darker-movie,Laura Bennett,10,"Fifty Shades Darker is very faithful to its predecessor’s vision. That is to say, it is another terrible movie with just the slightest whiff of self-awareness about how terrible it is."
3701,sorority-boys-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,20,"They don't even look as if they're having fun. Their stint as cross-dressers is simply an endurance test for them, and for us."
3702,north-by-northwest-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,100,"One of Hitchcock's very best comic thrillers, North by Northwest features scene after unforgettable scene."
3703,conan-the-barbarian-movie,Vincent Canby,30,"Conan the Barbarian is an extremely long, frequently incoherent, ineptly staged adventure-fantasy set in a prehistoric past."
3704,ed-wood-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"What Burton has made is a film which celebrates Wood more than it mocks him, and which celebrates, too, the zany spirit of 1950s exploitation films - in which a great title, a has-been star and a lurid ad campaign were enough to get bookings for some of the oddest films ever made."
3705,mark-felt-the-man-who-brought-down-the-white-house-movie,Peter Travers,63,"What the film, based on books by Felt and John D. O'Connor, lacks in narrative drive it strives to make up for with psychological probing. "
3706,the-forgotten-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"It's ""The Sixth Sense"" as nonsense, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" without the sunshine. Or the mind."
3707,the-past-movie,Scott Tobias,90,"Farhadi isn’t interested in judging his characters so much as comprehending them in all their complexity, and registering the consequences of their actions, particularly on children."
3708,the-longest-week-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"The film’s constant nods to the artificiality of its narrative highlight its precious, cloying phoniness rather than subvert it."
3709,chapter-27-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,"Perhaps the harshest criticism that can be directed at Chapter 27 is that it's awful even for a late-period Lindsay Lohan movie. It might even be bad enough to inspire ""Catcher"" author J.D. Salinger to break his decades of public silence to speak out against this high-camp fiasco."
3710,the-hangover-part-iii-movie,Stephen Whitty,16,"Galifianakis tries hard, and he has a few nice moments with guest star Melissa McCarthy, but this is a movie to make teetotalers of us all. "
3711,valentines-day-movie,Rex Reed,25,It’s a romantic piffle stuffed with so much candy that your skin could break out.
3712,suffragette-movie,Steven Rea,75,"If we now take a woman's right to vote and to hold public office for granted, Suffragette reminds us that it wasn't that long ago when things were different."
3713,below-movie,Janice Page,63,"With more character development this might have been an eerie thriller; with better payoffs, it could have been a thinking man's monster movie."
3714,hillarys-america-the-secret-history-of-the-democratic-party-movie,Vadim Rizov,0,"That a film already busy with historical reenactments, interviews, and conspiracizing of the wildest sort should end with three consecutive musical numbers suggests a kind of vaudeville structure to D’Souza’s work."
3715,holy-man-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,What a waste of a great comedian. What demented casting.
3716,rugrats-go-wild-movie,Desson Thomson,30,The exuberance of the Rugrats seems nullified by the effete quirkiness of the Thornberrys.
3717,chico-rita-movie,Michelle Orange,70,"The result has only a loose resemblance to Valdés's story - though real-life figures including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Chano Pozo, and a Cuban songstress who bears some resemblance to Rita Montaner are featured as characters - but it's a dazzling thing to behold."
3718,youth-without-youth-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"The film is a sharp disappointment to those who have been waiting for 10 years since the master's last film. The best that can be hoped is that, having made a film, Coppola has the taste again, and will go on to make many more, nothing like this."
3719,daybreakers-movie,Kimberley Jones,67,"It’s a little bit silly – as is Dafoe’s Kentucky-fried cowboy mechanic named Elvis – but silly is fun. In fact, one wishes it were sillier still."
3720,i-am-another-you-movie,Sheri Linden,90,I Am Another You offers further evidence of this young director’s investigative energy and eye for cinematic poetry without the slightest preciousness. 
3721,bad-boys-ii-movie,Scott Tobias,30,Bad Boys II is the rare case in which escapism involves leaving the theater.
3722,no-escape-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"The actors do well, with Brosnan playing a kind of James Bond who has fallen into seediness and shady dealings. Bell carries her weight in the emotional scenes and the battles, and Wilson proves (as he occasionally has) that he can do more than be a laid-back comic foil."
3723,hansel-and-gretel-witch-hunters-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,An exceedingly dull and stillborn attempt to update the Brothers Grimm. 
3724,certain-women-movie,A.A. Dowd ,83,"Like a lot of really strong short story collections, Certain Women is greater than the sum of its parts, even if one of those parts is also significantly greater than the others."
3725,churchill-movie,Kate Taylor,25,"The script, written by neophyte Alex von Tunzelmann, is appalling, its plot simplistic and its dialogue alternating between misplaced bits of contemporary psycho-babble and improbable grandiloquence."
3726,fifty-shades-darker-movie,Roger Moore,38,A film which promises “darker” but delivers “funnier” — with some of the laughs intentional.
3727,cadillac-records-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"With everything so wrong, how can there be anything right about Cadillac Records?"
3728,mr-deeds-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,Nothing about this movie works.
3729,central-station-movie,David Denby,90,An intimate epic.
3730,limitless-movie,Steve Persall,83,For two hours it's a fun head trip.
3731,gleason-movie,Steve Persall,75,The man's goodness and his support team's devotion are quickly obvious; Gleason is nearly two hours long. Tweel could get to every uplifting turn his movie makes a bit sooner.
3732,innocence-2001-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,Remarkable in several big ways.
3733,the-legend-of-hercules-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"This ludicrously written, buffoonishly acted, irritatingly filmed sword-and-sandals epic hasn't half the sand, sweat or saltiness of other titles in the genre."
3734,cloud-atlas-movie,Ann Hornaday,63,"While Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski haven't necessarily expanded on Mitchell's book, they've done a superlative job making it legible onscreen. Cloud Atlas deserves praise if only for not being the baggy, pretentious disaster it could have been in other hands."
3735,the-shape-of-water-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"The Shape of Water is brilliant, but sick — or maybe it’s sick, but brilliant. In any case, it’s something to see."
3736,land-ho!-movie,Eric D. Snider,65,"Though its uncluttered simplicity and refreshing lack of cliches render it sublimely enjoyable, the film never digs deep enough to give itself much weight."
3737,rounders-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"Although the storyline is predictable, the intelligent dialogue and top-drawer acting more than make up for the possible deficiency."
3738,the-life-of-david-gale-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Unlike ""Dead Man Walking"" and many honorable dramas before it, ""David Gale"" has nothing coherent to say about capital punishment, or anything else. It's a dead film lurching."
3739,sweet-november-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"Shamelessly manipulative in a crude, bullying way."
3740,things-to-come-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Huppert's brilliance is indisputable, her performance alternately playful and deeply moving."
3741,sphere-movie,Mike Clark,38,"Waterlogged trip to nowhere. [13 February 1998, p. 3D]"
3742,crazy-rich-asians-movie,David Noh,63,"Chu is definitely not an actor’s director, being far more concerned with splashy spectacle than intimate human emotions, and often you can feel scenes go slightly dead, with his performers likely called upon to improv their lines and motivation as best they can. "
3743,the-impossible-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,33,"The Impossible strikes an insincere tone, one that doesn't let the obviously powerful moments stand on their own, but instead follows the beautiful Hollywood stars to safety, while the real story is left on the ground. "
3744,fist-fight-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,"The slapsticky, sight-gag-heavy yukfest, which is filled with the kind of phallic humor you may have sniggered at when you were 16, floats like a dead butterfly and stings like a B-movie."
3745,goodbye-to-language-3d-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,91,"What Goodbye To Language presents — with its nonstop chatter, its endless musical and literary quotations, and its silly puns and poop jokes — is a dense, expressive, aggressive new medium rich with possibilities for juxtaposing images and creating meaning."
3746,devils-knot-movie,Claudia Puig,63,"While the film is not nearly as evocative as Egoyan's 1997 masterpiece ""The Sweet Hereafter"" (also about children who died tragically), it is still an intrinsically fascinating story."
3747,the-mod-squad-movie,Russell Smith,20,"A sketchy, half-baked, stylistically inconsistent movie that scarcely even pretends to care whether it makes sense or not. "
3748,the-look-of-silence-movie,Stephanie Merry,100,The Look of Silence is as beautiful as it is bleak.
3749,the-manchurian-candidate-movie,Angie Errigo,80,"A cracking conspiracy thriller that's well-cast, slyly satirical and -- as a solid, glossy, contemporised remix of a classic -- rings enough creepy changes to surprise."
3750,gone-baby-gone-movie,Jack Mathews,75,"The film's standout performance belongs to Ed Harris, who plays a Boston detective with decades of experience and an equal amount of built-up resentment toward people who would harm children."
3751,taxi-movie,Maitland McDonagh,30,"Queen Latifah is a natural-born charmer, but there's only so much she can do when paired with a costar so irritating it's hard not to squirm when he's on the screen, which is most of the time."
3752,frequency-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,A very complicated movie. It is also pretty wonderful.
3753,the-twilight-saga-new-moon-movie,Jordan Mintzer,70,"Carried by Kristen Stewart's compellingly dark performance, but also by helmer Chris Weitz's robust visuals."
3754,grizzly-man-movie,Glenn Kenny,100,Herzog not only tells an incredible story but implies a dark metaphysic of the natural world that makes this film unsettlingly larger than its human subject.
3755,gullivers-travels-movie,Mike Scott,38,"The really annoying thing about Jack Black's Gulliver's Travels is not so much that it's a bad movie -- it is bad, but only run-of-the-mill bad, not epic-misfire bad -- but that the movie sullies a piece of literature that has endured for nearly 300 years for the sake of a cheap kiddie flick that'll be forgotten in a month."
3756,higher-learning-movie,Peter Travers,75,"Higher Learning is seriously intended and seriously flawed. Singleton tends to shout his objectives. But in an era of cop-out escapism, it is gratifying to find a filmmaker who is spoiling to be heard."
3757,the-ladies-man-movie,Robert Koehler,20,The question isn't where is the love but where are the laughs?
3758,transamerica-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"The best, and perhaps the only, reason to see Duncan Tucker's Transamerica is for Felicity Huffman's touching, shape-shifting performance."
3759,the-attack-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"Remarkably accomplished and self-confident. In dramatic terms The Attack borrows a page from Alfred Hitchcock's playbook — an innocent in a strange land, delving into dangerous matters he doesn't understand. In political terms, though, the script is unsparing and ultimately bleak. It doesn't justify terrorism, but it does dramatize the rage and despair that dominate life in the occupied territories. "
3760,feardotcom-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"The film is a failure in just about every way, save for its acting, which is adequate."
3761,miss-meadows-movie,Glenn Kenny,25,"The earnestness brings the movie from mildly irritating pastiche status to actively awful, and that is all she wrote. "
3762,marie-antoinette-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,10,"Reports of boos at the film's debut at Cannes are more understandable now, not because Marie Antoinette is an inaccurate or indifferent look at French history (it is), but because it's self-indulgent shit. Booing - and beheading - are too good for it."
3763,paranormal-activity-3-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,"More of the same, using the found-footage tricks the first two films employed to try to shock the audience. But man, are those some good tricks."
3764,swimming-pool-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"After it is over, you will want to go back and think things through again, and I can help you by suggesting there is one, and only one, interpretation that resolves all of the difficulties, but if I told you, you would have to kill me."
3765,big-eyes-movie,Rex Reed,75,"Nimble, off the beaten track and very entertaining, it’s the cinematic equivalent of a lava lamp."
3766,dreamgirls-movie,Angie Errigo,80,"Ardent, accomplished, overwhelmingly emotional, with something to say and a dream cast saying it in song. Bravo."
3767,meduzot-movie,Michael Sragow,83,What gives the film a haunting and sometimes droll poetic unity is the way co-directors Etgar Keret and Shira Geffen trace all their characters moving in a jellyfish-like fashion.
3768,october-sky-movie,Joe Leydon,90,Immensely entertaining and unabashedly inspirational.
3769,twelve-movie,Pam Grady,30,"Unlike ""The Lost Boys,"" there are no bloodsuckers in Twelve. Instead, it just sucks time: 98 minutes to be exact that you can never get back."
3770,guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie,Keith Phipps,80,"Gunn, a B-movie enthusiast who got his start at Troma, has found a way to bring funkiness and humanity to a galaxy-spanning blockbuster, one filled with dogfights and floating fortresses, but also with heroes quick with a quip, fast on the draw, and more than a little beaten up by the universe."
3771,the-gatekeepers-movie,Farran Smith Nehme,88,"The filmmaker doesn't speculate about why these men are talking, but he leaves you with an excellent guess."
3772,iron-monkey-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,Gravity-defying kung fu choreography.
3773,star-wars-episode-i---the-phantom-menace-movie,Tom Keogh,30,It's a complete drag. 
3774,last-orders-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,"A superb film that begins with death, ends in renewal, and finds almost as much to laugh about as to cry for."
3775,nymphomaniac-volume-two-movie,Michelle Orange,90,"Nymphomaniac is a jigsaw opus, an extended and generally exquisitely crafted riff. Story, theme, and character (despite Gainsbourg's captivations) bow to von Trier's gamesmanship, which makes his own promiscuities the film's true subject."
3776,the-butterfly-effect-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"It's a terrible life, and a terrible movie."
3777,the-love-witch-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,80,"Although the beguiling spell begins to wear off before reaching its full two-hour length, the film’s got style for days thanks to Biller’s affection for classic — as well as not-so-classic — cinema.   "
3778,102-dalmatians-movie,Richard Gehr,20,"Cruella is once again bent on collecting enough puppy skins to fashion the frock of her dreams. And once again, yawn."
3779,double-take-2001-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,30,"You get the feeling that everyone was in a good mood and the margaritas were pouring, but neither Gallo nor anybody else ever found a bottom line for this movie or its characters."
3780,north-by-northwest-movie,Pauline Kael,90,"Though not as cleverly original as ""Strangers on a Train"", or as cleverly sexy as ""Notorious"", this is one of Hitchcock's most entertaining American thrillers."
3781,the-ladykillers-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,So what if the movie isn't finger-lickin' good like the original? The performances by Hanks as a crook and Irma P. Hall as his honorable landlady are mighty tasty.
3782,dark-crimes-movie,April Wolfe,30,"This is one very ugly movie at its heart, not for how Englert photographed it but for how bleak and unrelenting the violence is — even that ending can’t dig Dark Crimes out of its dark hole."
3783,return-to-me-movie,Rene Rodriguez,63,"As light and fluffy as it is, Return to Me still proves surprisingly inviting."
3784,south-park-bigger-longer-uncut-movie,David Edelstein,90,"This isn't just the most riotously inventive movie of the year, it's the raunch anthem of the age."
3785,the-book-of-henry-movie,Josh Kupecki,0,"The Book of Henry is the most misguided film since the 2003 Gary Oldman abomination ""Tiptoes."" Trevorrow is slated to helm an upcoming Star Wars film, so y’all have fun with that."
3786,love-sex-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,70,"It's sharply chiseled but not cynical, and that's a delicate line to walk."
3787,jarhead-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Jarhead is about how the experience of being in the military fundamentally changes an individual. In this case, the focus isn't about the madness of slaughter in the jungle, but the madness of inaction in the desert."
3788,johnny-english-reborn-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"The laughs, including the big laughs, keep coming right up to the closing seconds."
3789,u-turn-movie,Maitland McDonagh,20,"The parade of eccentrics never ends, and Stone's near-miraculous achievement is to drain the life right out of material so sordid you'd think it couldn't help but be interesting. A must to avoid."
3790,the-good-heart-movie,Melissa Anderson,10,"A sloppy, desultory, depressive buddy comedy the color of beer-infused pee."
3791,blood-ties-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,Fine actors are let down by a comatose script and wayward direction in this retro crime drama.
3792,the-bitter-pill-movie,Drew Taylor,75,"The picture's conspiratorial late-night tone and fleshy after hours luridness was practically built for watching at night, when our parents think we've gone off to bed (think '80s films directed by folks like Adrian Lyne)."
3793,dear-wendy-movie,Dana Stevens,10,"The story is laughably incoherent, which would be less bothersome if the movie were not also so unremittingly pretentious."
3794,the-salt-of-life-movie,Jay Weissberg,70,"Di Gregorio's dialogue and performers are once again marked by a spontaneity and ease; who else working today treats so-called ""middle age"" with such jocular honesty? "
3795,view-from-the-top-movie,Maitland McDonagh,30,"Frankly, the film's nostalgia for the ""coffee, tea or me?"" era of flying, when stewardesses were fantasy figures in soaring heels and uniforms tailored for bust enhancement rather than utility, is retro in all the wrong ways. "
3796,the-wrestler-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,The movie has the simplicity and confidence of a Johnny Cash song.
3797,tomorrow-never-dies-movie,Peter Travers,0,"You can see most of the plugs in the trailer. As most fans of the early, better Bond films know, the only life left in the series is in the gadgets....As for humor, Brosnan can deaden a double-entendre faster than he can change outfits."
3798,finding-nemo-movie,Mark Caro,100,"Finding Nemo and its Pixar predecessors tap into the shared gene among the kids and adults that delights in imagination-engaging, eye-tickling and wit-filled storytelling. You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure."
3799,the-mummy-movie,Jonathan Foreman,88,"Cheerful, slightly cheesy entertainment that uses the latest special-effects techniques to breathe life into a venerable film tradition."
3800,my-week-with-marilyn-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"Branagh is marvelous at conveying his exasperation. His conceit is that Olivier offstage acted the same as Olivier onstage – as if all of life was a vast playlet. For someone as thoroughly actorly as Olivier, this is probably no exaggeration. I would like to think that the great man himself would have smiled at Branagh's rollicking rendition of tantrums."
3801,velvet-goldmine-movie,Anthony Lane,30,Quite an achievement: the American director Todd Haynes revisits the world of London glam rock and manages to make it look dull.
3802,deliver-us-from-eva-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,30,"Not that there aren't funny moments in the film, but they're cobbled together so awkwardly that you'd never suspect the director had made a film before."
3803,the-devil-inside-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,38,"The film's contradictory and nullifying dilemma of wanting to be both scripted and vérité at once, a plight that affects so much contemporary TV, is temporarily quelled in heated scenes of curse-laden levitation and Linda Blair contortion, which dutifully deliver the scares."
3804,life-as-we-know-it-movie,Connie Ogle,38,"Sometimes I suspect there is secret high-stakes contest in Hollywood among filmmakers to try and come up with a movie without a single original idea. If so, Life As We Know It is a contender."
3805,the-human-stain-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"The Human Stain has those qualities we often want but rarely see in our films: intelligence and ambition, decency and humanity, poetry and pity, fire and ice. Watch it and weep."
3806,the-wedding-planner-movie,Dana Stevens,30,"It's like watching two superbly conditioned rowers try to race a boat made of folded newspaper. Hard as they work, they just can't make it go any faster."
3807,the-basketball-diaries-movie,Joe Brown,10,"There's little momentum, no real story line, just Carroll's tediously inevitable descent from low to lowest."
3808,wallace-gromit-the-curse-of-the-were-rabbit-movie,Lawrence Toppman,100,The giddiest and funniest animated film of the year.
3809,mad-hot-ballroom-movie,Lawrence Toppman,88,"These kids may be too small for sports and may not be headed to college on academic scholarships. But for once, they've proven to the world and to themselves that they matter."
3810,the-road-movie-movie,Michael Gingold,80,"Kalashnikov eschews submerging us in twisted metal and carnage. Instead, The Road Movie is a study of human nature under unusual circumstances, revealing the often stoic and nonchalant nature of the Russian character"
3811,poseidon-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"It's ""Das Bomb."" It's ""The Perfunctory Storm."""
3812,the-lesson-movie,Farran Smith Nehme,75,"There’s a superficial resemblance to the Dardenne brothers’ “Two Days, One Night,” and like that film it has a strong lead; Gosheva’s Nade is prickly, and no suffering saint. "
3813,the-four-feathers-movie,Chuck Wilson,30,A mindless muddle.
3814,seeking-a-friend-for-the-end-of-the-world-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"This is a romantic comedy for people who don't like rom-coms. There's no chance of a happy ending, but its tender mercies speak volumes."
3815,dead-snow-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"Dead Snow, as you may have gathered, is a comedy, but played absolutely seriously by sincere, earnest young actors."
3816,brooklyn-castle-movie,Michelle Orange,70,We also gain a keen sense of how chess in particular helps otherwise academically challenged kids find a way into their own brains.
3817,rings-movie,Randall Colburn,25,Rings is too beholden with current trends to truly exploit the potential it displays in its early going.
3818,a-hard-days-night-re-release-movie,Jack Mathews,100,As joyously energetic now as the day it arrived.
3819,the-quiet-american-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"The acting, especially by the male leads, is superlative."
3820,were-the-millers-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"A ""Jennifer Aniston movie"" has become synonymous with ""derivative, lackluster mediocrity,"" and it's a shame. We know she has both talent and charisma but nothing on her recent resume has allowed her to display those qualities. So we're stuck with films that are at best forgettable and at worst painful."
3821,the-jane-austen-book-club-movie,Ann Hornaday,70,"Everyone is given their due and dignity in this funny, sexy, humanist film that, if it is a chick flick, gives the genre a good name."
3822,what-we-do-is-secret-movie,Nick Pinkerton,20,"The worst kind of bastard adaptation, Secret subtracts without adding."
3823,frank-lola-movie,Owen Gleiberman,90,"It’s poised between reality and paranoid daydream, it’s about the dangerous ways that love can go wrong, and it does the thing that noir was invented to do: It sucks you in."
3824,spy-kids-3-d-game-over-movie,Megan Lehmann,38,"Combined with the eyestrain produced by the cheap cardboard 3-D glasses, the resulting vertigo is decidedly unpleasant -- although having moon rocks and blobs of cream pie flying out from the screen is kinda cool in a retro way. "
3825,end-of-watch-movie,Steve Persall,0,"End of Watch is a repellent movie, first for its shaky-cam conceit rendering much of the action incomprehensible, and finally for seeking to entertain viewers through the thuggish execution of a police officer."
3826,nutty-professor-ii-the-klumps-movie,Lisa Alspector,20,Wastes most of its 110 minutes making impotent jokes about male sexual behavior and the repugnance of old women.
3827,titanic-town-movie,Stephen Holden,80,In its harshly realistic scenes... it stirs your blood.
3828,total-recall-2012-movie,John Semley,38,"Len Wiseman's Total Recall's a trifling mess, as superfluous as a third breast."
3829,little-voice-movie,Peter Brunette,90,"Little Voice is that rarity, a filmed adaptation of a stage play that actually works."
3830,the-tailor-of-panama-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"In a world full of off the rack thrillers, it's fine boutique quality."
3831,lilya-4-ever-movie,V.A. Musetto,88,"Lilya is portrayed by Oksana Akinshina, who gives a dynamic, heartbreaking performance... She was wonderful in [""Brothers""], but is even more astonishing in Lilya 4-Ever."
3832,safe-haven-movie,Tom Russo,38,A movie that passably ambles along in generic-melodrama mode before finally insulting audience intelligence one time too many. 
3833,tyler-perrys-shes-living-my-life-movie,Owen Gleiberman,10,"A ludicrously scattershot drama in which overwrought feminine rage, diary-of-a-mad-woman craziness, and inept filmmaking are all but inseparable."
3834,shaun-the-sheep-movie-movie,Steve Persall,75,"The stop-motion technique never ceases to fascinate, but the episodic structure of Shaun the Sheep Movie hinders any true emotional buildup and payoff. "
3835,focus-2015-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"The preposterousness of the story doesn’t seem like a rip-off, since the twists in the plot, for the most part, pay off nicely."
3836,bulletproof-monk-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,38,"No visual style, amateur effects."
3837,hancock-movie,Marc Savlov,30,A godforsaken (possibly literally) mess.
3838,8-women-movie,Paula Nechak,75,A frothy and deliriously enjoyable souffle.
3839,beautiful-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"Teeters from a noisy sitcom (only one step removed from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"") to brickbat satire until it collapses in a pool of redemptive mush."
3840,shaun-the-sheep-movie-movie,Peter Keough,88,"Like a great silent movie, it creates its pathos and comedy out of the concrete objects being animated, building elaborate gags involving everyday items transformed into Rube Goldberg devices that sometimes entrap the characters, or, when properly manipulated by them, provide a means of achieving their goals."
3841,the-paperboy-movie,Mike Scott,20,"This is the kind of film that feels like a dream - but not in the good way. Rather, it resembles a dream in that it is made up of disjointed, loosely connected bits of surrealist craziness - ideas that might have seemed interesting in the twilight hours but that don't come close to standing up to the light of day."
3842,the-salt-of-the-earth-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,100,"The Salt of the Earth, has the power to draw you into its world, transfix, and perhaps eventually transform you."
3843,the-prey-movie,Rex Reed,75,"Okay, The Prey is ridiculous hokum that proves the French can make overwrought Hollywood thrillers with the same indefatigable energy and implausible realism as anyone else. It is also a slick, suspenseful adrenalin rush disguised as unexpected, nerve-wracking fun."
3844,the-man-from-uncle-movie,Peter Travers,63,"Vikander, the sexbot in ""Ex Machina,"" is having a hell of a year. And you can see why. Gaby isn't much of a part, but Vikander makes her a live wire. Her impromptu dance with Kuryakin that ends in a wrestling match is, well, something to see."
3845,the-lego-batman-movie,Jody Mitori,75,Michael Keaton and Christian Bale are the best. George Clooney and Ben Affleck are among the worst. But Will Arnett is by far the funniest.
3846,grizzly-man-movie,Liam Lacey,88,"Compelling, disturbing."
3847,the-talented-mr-ripley-movie,Roger Ebert,100,The movie is as intelligent a thriller as you'll see this year.
3848,out-of-the-furnace-movie,Todd McCarthy,80,"In the meaty bad guy role, Harrelson entertainingly goes all the way, putting him way out there on the ledge with any of your favorite loonies, psychos and unhinged nutjobs."
3849,the-butler-movie,Peter Travers,63,"It's watching Cecil open his eyes, in Whitaker's reflective, powerfully understated performance, that fills this flawed film with potency and purpose. Striving really does bring its own glory."
3850,mud-movie,Peter Debruge,80,"Mud poses as a mere adolescent adventure tale but explores a rich vein of grown-up concerns, exploring codes of honor, love and family too solid to be shaken by modernizing forces."
3851,the-lego-batman-movie-movie,Amy Nicholson,100,"With The LEGO Batman Movie, a shiny, irresistible delight, blockbuster flicks have perfected their ideal form."
3852,black-girl-1966-movie,Moira Macdonald,100,"It’s a remarkable personal-is-political drama, set in barely postcolonial Senegal and France."
3853,the-shallows-movie,Steve Persall,75,An efficiently preposterous thriller.
3854,bad-hurt-movie,Jared Mobarak,67,"Kemble takes great care to construct a tough Staten Island-raised, Irish-American history so each personal struggle depicted can be traced back and rendered authentic. "
3855,the-fantastic-four-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"Steer clear, Friends of Ol’ Marvel! "
3856,kingsman-the-golden-circle-movie,Conor O'Donnell,16,"Taken on it’s own merits — or lack thereof – Kingsman: The Golden Circle feels like being trapped in a dorm room, while a bunch of frat bros watch the first Kingsman and tell you it’s the greatest movie ever made."
3857,just-a-kiss-movie,Laura Sinagra,10,A convoluted writing exercise gone horribly wrong.
3858,silent-house-movie,Ed Gonzalez,25,"Silent House dies a sudden and egregious death when the amateur players in Olsen's company, Adam Trese and Eric Sheffer Stevens, as her character Sarah's father and uncle, respectively, open their traps."
3859,no-stranger-than-love-movie,Sara Stewart,25,The considerable comic talents of Alison Brie (“Community”) are squandered by this exhaustingly quirky indie romance.
3860,the-mod-squad-movie,Todd McCarthy,10,Feels like the most shameless effort yet in the renewed exploitation of the youth market.
3861,foxtrot-movie,Roger Moore,88,"It’s a somber film with flashes of wit, with funereal pacing and long, poignant close-ups that let the players — especially Ashkenazi and Adler — let us see there’s more than what we see on the surface, just with a look."
3862,half-past-dead-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"It goes through the motions of an action thriller, but there is a deadness at its center, a feeling that no one connected with it loved what they were doing."
3863,landline-movie,Leah Greenblatt,83,"In sweetly calibrated moments — a downtown drug deal gone wrong; Falco alone under strobe lights, swaying ecstatically to Donna Summer — Landline finds the analog joy it’s reaching for."
3864,monkeybone-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,Adds up to one numbingly unfunny comedy.
3865,war-dogs-movie,Ann Hornaday,37,"War Dogs stays at arm’s length from the subjects, afraid to implicate us in the pleasures and prosperity of their rise, thus making their fall seem distant, puny and unaffecting."
3866,find-me-guilty-movie,Peter Travers,63,"Sadly, Lumet's skill at bringing out the juice in actors isn't enough to save the film from overkill."
3867,derailed-movie,Ella Taylor,30,"Directed by Swedish filmmaker Mikael Håfström, who's clearly new at the genre, this aptly named movie is riddled with obvious parallels, crude moral talking points, a script  so awful it's practically avant-garde, and a vain attempt at comic relief by RZA."
3868,i-frankenstein-movie,Drew Taylor,0,This movie is a corpse in desperate need of reanimation.
3869,irreplaceable-you-movie,Nick Schager,30,"Gugu Mbatha-Raw is a charming actress who radiates poise and intelligence, which is why Irreplaceable You — in which her character acts in ways that are clearly self-destructive and counterproductive — rings so false."
3870,blended-movie,A.O. Scott,0,Most of Blended has the look and pacing of a three-camera sitcom filmed by a bunch of eighth graders and conceived by their less bright classmates. Shots don’t match. Jokes misfire. Gags that are visible from a mile away fail to deliver.
3871,bad-boys-ii-movie,James Berardinelli,12,The only thing as bad as bad comedy is bad action. Bad Boys II has plenty of both.
3872,spider-man-homecoming-movie,Brian Truitt,88,The magic of Homecoming is that it belongs more to the John Hughes cinematic universe than the Avengers’.
3873,the-fan-movie,Kenneth Turan,10,"Even in thriller terms, nothing rings remotely true here, with even the baseball action--including a game that is not called despite enough rain to unnerve Noah--laced with a heavy dose of preposterousness."
3874,lumumba-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,"The film does succeed in making the story universal, giving us the drama as well as the history, the fire as well as cool examination. It's a movie that haunts you afterward."
3875,a-love-affair-of-sorts-movie,Andrew Schenker,12,David Guy Levy's movie foregrounds the potential ugliness of modern technology in order to comment on it. But that doesn't make the film's visuals any less hideous.
3876,playing-the-field-movie,Carrie Rickey,38,"This saga of a former soccer star coaching his son's team in order to worm his way back into the heart of his ex-wife aims to be warm and funny. Alas, it is mechanical and exhausting, like a windup toy of a monkey crashing together cymbals for 106 minutes while incrementally winding down."
3877,monte-carlo-movie,Roger Moore,38,"This script, this leaden direction ensures that even as the teen wish-fulfillment fantasy, complete with young women playing dress-up, Monte Carlo fails. "
3878,the-6th-day-movie,Sean Means,10,Another droning formulaic thriller.
3879,god-bless-america-movie,Shawn Levy,67,"Offers a few laughs and a moment or two of drama, but it's finally more of a conceit -- and a familiar one -- than a film. "
3880,the-little-mermaid-movie,Kathleen Carroll,100,"Audiences of all ages are bound to fall in love with this bubbly, thoroughly enchanting fish story."
3881,the-spirit-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"Ultimately, it's a long, incoherent mess of a film, enlivened only by the sure knowledge that the great Will Eisner's original is available to one and all at your nearest comic-book shop."
3882,standing-in-the-shadows-of-motown-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"A glorious feature-length documentary -- This film will leave an indentment, and a deep one, on anyone who loves great, joyous music and cares about the people who make it."
3883,my-big-fat-greek-wedding-2-movie,Eric Henderson,38,"As far as shameless excuses to rehash crowd-pleasing gags from the first film go, it doesn't particularly go about its duties cynically. "
3884,rollerball-movie,Paul Malcolm,0,"Rollerball pushes the Hollywood action movie to stratospheric new levels of incoherence; pounding at the senses, it's mashed story, character, time and space into a chunky hash."
3885,mission-impossible-ii-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"Moves with terrific energy, alternating riveting action sequences with intimate material in a manner that's pure Woo."
3886,warrior-movie,Dan Jolin,100,"It hardly rewrites the rulebook, but Warrior is a powerful, moving and brilliant sports-pic-cum-family drama. Like ""The Fighter,"" but with kicking. "
3887,killer-of-sheep-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,100,"Shot on a year's worth of weekends on a minuscule budget (less than $20,000), this remarkable work--conceivably the best single feature about ghetto life that we have--was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry as one of the key works of the American cinema, an ironic and belated form of recognition for a film that has had virtually no distribution. It shouldn't be missed."
3888,kill-your-darlings-movie,Geoff Pevere,38,"It adds nothing to our understanding of ""Howl,"" and the movie is exactly what the poem isn’t: ordinary. "
3889,boys-dont-cry-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"A kick to the heart, and Swank is a marvel.  Any problems in the storytelling are more than balanced by her wholly committed work."
3890,the-box-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,20,"The Box is its own kind of awful, a disconnected mess that never finds its reason for being."
3891,zookeeper-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,Zookeeper barely avoids a zero-star rating because of James.
3892,the-perfect-man-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,What sin did Heather Locklear commit to deserve her role in The Perfect Man?
3893,killers-movie,Steve Persall,16,"Everybody's cyber-pal Ashton Kutcher is perfect casting for Killers, since the screenplay is shallow as a Tweet and the movie appears to have been shot with a Nikon point-and-click camera he plugs on  TV."
3894,loving-vincent-movie,James Mottram,80,"An animated film like no other, Loving Vincent is a staggering visual achievement."
3895,the-social-network-movie,Kimberley Jones,89,Blisteringly entertaining. 
3896,the-nice-guys-movie,Owen Gleiberman,90,"The Nice Guys is an ultra-violent burlesque, the sort of cheerfully hostile buddy bash that’s been a staple since the ’80s, only this one is singularly clever about its own triviality, and it offers the scruffy pleasure of seeing two great actors dial down their gravitas with style."
3897,no-movie,Anthony Lane,90,"The best movie ever made about Chilean plebiscites, NO thoroughly deserves its Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film."
3898,bad-company-movie,Sam Allis,12,The major problem with this alleged comic thriller is it is neither funny nor thrilling. Neither the heavies nor the good guys are believable.
3899,is-that-a-gun-in-your-pocket-movie,Neil Genzlinger,0,Everybody involved with the awful comedy Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?... owes Aristophanes an apology. It’s one thing to borrow a guy’s premise; it’s quite another to transform it into something this unwatchable.
3900,the-virgin-suicides-movie,Jonathan Foreman,100,"It's hard to remember a film that mixes disparate, delicate ingredients with the subtlety and virtuosity of Sofia Coppola's brilliant The Virgin Suicides."
3901,quest-for-fire-movie,Gary Arnold,88,"Quest for Fire expresses an eloquent partiality for civilized virtues, especially companionship, sexual bonding and parenthood. [05 Mar 1982, p.B12]"
3902,in-another-country-movie,Neil Young,70,"Two arthouse ""worlds"" collide with amusing and intriguing -- if hardly earth-shattering -- results in cult Korean writer-director Hong Sangsoo's In Another Country."
3903,a-sound-of-thunder-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"A Sound of Thunder is positively awash in bad hairpieces, leading one to believe that global warming is going to be the least of our problems."
3904,the-accountant-movie,Alonso Duralde,70,"Audiences willing to just go with the movie’s outlandish lead character will find laughs and thrills along the way, as well as that rarest of studio properties: a tentpole that actually leaves you enthusiastic about the prospect of a sequel."
3905,crystal-fairy-the-magical-cactus-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Anything can happen when Michael Cera wanders around Chile without a script on a mission to get high on mescaline. Or, in the case of Crystal Fairy, nothing could happen, too."
3906,black-knight-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,"This time-travel scenario is by now shopworn, and the normally riotous Lawrence, a manic and gifted clown, is hamstrung in his efforts to eke humor from the anemic script."
3907,argo-movie,Dan Jolin,80,"An old-school espionage thriller with a movie-biz comedy twist, all the better for being (almost) entirely true. It is to Ben Affleck's credit that the tension and laughs complement rather than neutralise each other."
3908,swimfan-movie,Peter Travers,10,"It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck, preferably a semi."
3909,the-best-and-the-brightest-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,0,"If you are going to be this mean-spirited, you had better deliver the jokes, but the film's attacks on pretentious parents - not to mention put-downs of hardworking immigrants - consistently come off as more hateful than humorous. "
3910,coyote-ugly-movie,Jay Carr,38,Such an utter piece of fluff so conceptually barren it might as well be a music video.
3911,as-above-so-below-movie,Robert Abele,10,An entertainment-free sinkhole of Dramamine-worthy nonsense.
3912,ant-man-and-the-wasp-movie,Jake Coyle,75,"For some Marvel devotees, Ant-Man and The Wasp will be a clever enough diversion in between the more main-event releases. But it’s pretty much exactly what I’d want in a superhero movie: a funny cast, zippy action scenes and not an infinity stone in sight."
3913,the-boss-movie,Michael Phillips,38,The Boss has zero finesse as a comedy.
3914,cocktail-movie,Jay Carr,0,"There isn't a scene in Cocktail that isn't cheap and dumb, and whether its camp entertainment value compensates for its contempt for women is a question. Cocktail makes beer commercials look deep, makes ""Top Gun"" look like ""Hamlet."" [29 Jul 1988, p.21]"
3915,the-five-senses-movie,Paula Nechak,83,"If you can forgive some plot artifice and gloss, there's a seductively intuitive and resonant theme resting at the core of Jeremy Podeswa's haunting new film."
3916,eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Despite jumping through the deliberately disorienting hoops of its story, Eternal Sunshine has an emotional center, and that's what makes it work."
3917,the-confirmation-movie,Tony Hinds,67,"Nelson’s screenwriting voice is unpretentious, approaching earnestly grounded characters with a deliberate lack of sentimentality."
3918,mr-death-the-rise-and-fall-of-fred-a-leuchter-jr-movie,Lisa Alspector,90,"Using archly staged interviews and reconstructions that draw attention to the components of the documentary form, Morris does justice to the complexity of hot-button issues by suggesting several layers of subtext at once, portraying the articulate Leuchter as both rational and prone to rationalize."
3919,passengers-2016-movie,Glenn Kenny,38,"I’m not even going to discuss, in detail at least, the elephant in the ideological room that Passengers inhabits, which is its spectacular sexism. "
3920,son-of-the-bride-movie,Ken Fox,70,Sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears.
3921,osmosis-jones-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"Should never have been released, not even on video. It should have been placed in a hazardous waste container, encased in concrete and dumped into the Farrelly brothers' septic tank."
3922,get-carter-movie,Jay Carr,38,A sodden-looking film.

3926,fay-grim-movie,Kevin Crust,70,"A sophisticated, sometimes intentionally silly spy thriller of international intrigue, Fay Grim charts the history of American foreign policy while commenting on current global complications with wink and a nudge."
3927,sinister-2-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Sinister 2 has so little connection to the first film (save for the home movies) that if you see enough horror movies, you will strain to recall the original."
3928,the-musketeer-movie,William Arnold,0,"Has the distinction of being the very worst of all the many film versions of Alexandre Dumas' classic novel, ""The Three Musketeers."" Nothing else in Musketeer movie history comes even remotely close to its staggering wretchedness."
3929,sleepers-movie,David Ansen,10,"Rent the devastating ""The Boys of St. Vincent"" to see how slick and hollow Sleepers is, how little it reveals about the real nature and effect of child abuse.  [28 October 1996, p. 74]"
3930,beowulf-movie,Staff (Not credited),70,"The bolder stroke comes from screenwriters Roger Avary (Pulp Fiction) and Neil Gaiman (the graphic novel Sandman), who’ve turned the arthritic legend into sort of an Arthur Miller play in chain mail."
3931,the-business-of-fancydancing-movie,Janice Page,63,"Shot in digital video, Fancydancing feels a bit like a racy after-school special. Performances are amateurishly uneven."
3932,bad-boys-ii-movie,J.R. Jones,0,"This putrid action flick crawls along for two and a half hours before expiring in a septic field of bad one-liners, halfhearted catchphrases, obliterated cars, vicious slow-motion bullet penetration, graphic corpse mutilations played for laughs, and shamefully hollow bonding scenes between its two dyspeptic megastars."
3933,step-up-all-in-movie,Kimberley Jones,30,"Because “all in” – to me, at least – suggests a certain standard of enthusiasm, of emphaticness, and what this latest Step Up movie indifferently chunks out falls far short of that standard."
3934,leonard-cohen-im-your-man-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"I'm Your Man has at its spiritual center a troubadour with a distinctive, cagey mellowness about him."
3935,the-chronicles-of-narnia-the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-movie,Michael Sragow,100,Plunges into an imaginative landscape as large as all creation - and never slackens its barreling pace or shrinks its panoramic scope.
3936,searching-for-sugar-man-movie,Matt Glasby,80,The tale is better than the telling – and the soundtrack's better still – but music this monumental demands its moment. Now go and buy the album.
3937,extremely-loud-and-incredibly-close-movie,Wesley Morris,75,"So all the handsome shots that turn the city into a toyland and all the superb editing and vibrant art direction - all the formal tricks Daldry uses to whip you up and work you over - risk being too much. After 45 minutes, it can feel like junk on a sundae. But the movie has a human coup."
3938,arachnophobia-movie,David Ansen,80,"It pushes the audience's buttons with Pavlovian finesse, manufacturing industrial-strength adrenaline. First-time director Frank Marshall has long been Steven Spielberg's producer, and he's learned the master's lessons well. "
3939,the-white-ribbon-movie,Richard Corliss,100,"A kind of mashup of ""Our Town"" and ""Village of the Damned,"" the film is both draining and enthralling."

3941,knight-and-day-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"Cruise and Diaz have worked together before (in Vanilla Sky), but this is their first summer-movie pairing, and their star qualities are so similar--dazzling looks, good comedic chops, complete emotional vacuity--that together, instead of romantic chemistry they generate a sort of giddy, blinding falseness."
3942,the-journey-movie,Marc Savlov,78,Spall and Meaney are mesmerizingly watchable in a film that’s 40% gruff dialogue and 60% seething silences.
3943,because-i-said-so-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"It's a dreadful exercise, tin-eared and sincere, bereft of any truth or inspiration."
3944,lights-out-movie,Moira Macdonald,63,"Lights Out is an effective, tidy little chiller; basically the same sneak-up-in-the-dark scare over and over. But hey, as we’ve learned through decades of horror movies, that stuff works."

3949,my-neighbor-totoro-movie,Peter Stack,100,"My Neighbor Totoro is drawn in an expansive, naturalistic way that makes an atmosphere of trees, rice fields and hills unraveling in the distance a hypnotic shadow character. In some scenes this nature is so delicious it becomes a poetical presence. [08 May 1993, p.C3]"
3950,the-space-between-us-movie,Alonso Duralde,20,"It’s hard not to engage in eye-rolling over what already promises to be one of 2017’s worst movies: The Space Between Us spends so much time piling one daffy, laughable plot beat upon another that it never bothers to nail down the characters."
3951,on-the-job-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,70,"Matti sets a brisk pace, utilizing the squalor and desperation of Manila's slums and prisons as well as powerful, against-type performances by Torre and Pascual to give us a familiar yet engaging thriller (with more than a few surprises)."
3952,summer-wars-movie,Joe Williams,75,Summer Wars has engineered a truce between the familiar and the fantastical.
3953,a-love-affair-of-sorts-movie,Vadim Rizov,0,"For more experienced viewers, the tired terrain is badly shot and haphazardly assembled into an audience-testing feature that appears to have no idea how unlikable or unprovocative it is."
3954,jolene-movie,Nick Schagaer,30,"Throughout, Chastain delivers a full-bodied debut performance, but she's ultimately stuck taking her wandering-soul protagonist far more seriously than it-or the film-deserves. "
3955,breathe-2017-movie,Roger Moore,63,"Actor Andy Serkis (“Black Panther”) steps behind the camera to direct here, and manages a genial, slow-moving and upbeat picture — for the middle acts. The first act courtship is strictly “Masterpiece Theater,” and the drawn-out third-act a grim different picture with an altogether different agenda."
3956,pawn-shop-chronicles-movie,Gabe Toro,16,"It’s all very first draft, with a layer of supernatural permeating the events that suggests added attempts to connect three wildly disparate storylines."
3957,life-after-beth-movie,Ann Hornaday,10,The promise of its premise is squandered all too soon in what becomes yet another tiresome exercise in the way-overworked zombie genre.
3958,recess-schools-out-movie,Todd McCarthy,20,"Animation is dull and characterless, and vocal talent has evidently received blanket direction to, when in doubt, shout."
3959,the-snapper-1993-movie,Marc Savlov,78,"There's not as much bombast here as there was in Parker's Commitments, but then Frears is an entirely different kind of director. He prefers the ensemble to the character study, and here he does a wonderful job of it."

3963,the-dead-pool-movie,Gene Siskel,88,"Where the previous sequels have been mostly dour gun blasts, The Dead Pool is a thriller with wit and humor and tension. [15 Jul 1988, p.A]"
3964,churchill-movie,Daniel Schindel,20,It’s difficult to think of a biopic that so thoroughly embarrasses its subject in the process of attempting to honor them the way Churchill does.
3965,boxing-helena-movie,Joe Brown,10,"A two-hour stink bomb, Boxing Helena is a pitifully pervy piece of work."
3966,frequency-movie,David Armstrong,63,"There's a novel, engaging story trying to transmit through the storm of special effects and convoluted plot twists that mar the movie."
3967,amelie-movie,A.O. Scott,90,"There is no denying that Amélie is, to paraphrase its title, fabulous."
3968,butterfly-kiss-movie,Rick Groen,63,"Shows promise, but needs more effort, and definitely doesn't play well with others. [7 Jun 1996, p.C2]"
3969,wreck-it-ralph-movie,Keith Staskiewicz,83,"There are more videogame cameos and winks than you can shake a Wiimote at - even the Konami Code, the gamer's paternoster, makes an appearance - but the real success of the film is its emotional core and the relationship between the two misfits."
3970,oz-the-great-and-powerful-movie,Calum Marsh,12,"An amorphous melange of ill-fitting reference points and misappropriated aesthetics, a lumbering family blockbuster both tiresome and wholly indistinct."
3971,my-best-friend-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"Terrifically acted, reassuringly formulaic, and moderately amusing."
3972,stronger-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Based on the bestseller by Bauman and Bret Witter and blessed with a nuanced script by John Pollono, the film makes sure that tears, when they come, are fully earned."
3973,eyes-wide-shut-movie,Mike Clark,100,"A precisely modulated and mostly mesmerizing 2¾-hour suspense movie, in part because it's one of the most bravely disturbing screen works ever attempted about thoughts withheld by even the most devoted marriage partners and the ramifications of voicing them."
3974,talk-to-her-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"This is Almodovar's stab at serious drama, and the result is bizarre and affecting but also unsettling in ways that the filmmaker may not have intended."
3975,the-prestige-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Nolan directs the film exactly like a great trick, so you want to see it again the second it's over. I'd call that wicked clever."
3976,columbus-movie,Peter Keough,88,Kogonada establishes a meditative tone and rhythm as his compositions parallel the building’s pleasing symmetries. 
3977,lilo-stitch-movie,Kenneth Turan,80,"Looser and less obviously formulaic in its fresh approach to our hearts, the brash Lilo & Stitch has an unleashed, subversive sense of humor that's less corporate and more uninhibited than any non-Pixar Disney film."
3978,tron-legacy-movie,John DeVore,12,Tron: Legacy will only be enjoyed by men in their thirties and early forties searching for a Proustian moment.
3979,the-runner-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Writer-director Austin Stark’s film crams a lot into 90 minutes, leaving no room for grace notes, little time for the heart that this truncated story cries out for."
3980,best-in-show-movie,Eddie Cockrell,90,"A barkingly funny new ""mockumentary"" that does for those canine pageants what the helmer's 1996 ""Waiting for Guffman"" did for smalltown theatrics."
3981,the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn---part-2-movie,Amy Nicholson,80,"Every frame of silent, lip-biting, pent-up tension in the series has been holding its breath for this -- a 600-minute soap opera suddenly exploding into a Grindhouse slasher. "
3982,the-manchurian-candidate-movie,J. Hoberman,80,"Demme, who works a clever permutation on the original ending, is more than capable of doing the thriller thing--even with material that will strike a good percentage of his audience as familiar. As an intelligent genre flick, the movie plays to his strengths. His direction of actors has never been better."
3983,rings-movie,Peter Travers,0,"If crap movies carried penalties for inflicting torture on audiences, then Rings would merit a death sentence."
3984,joe-versus-the-volcano-movie,Vincent Canby,10,"Not since ""Howard the Duck"" has there been a big-budget comedy with feet as flat as those of Joe Versus the Volcano. Many gifted people contributed to it, but there's no disbelieving the grim evidence on the screen."
3985,the-pledge-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,70,"A nervy as well as somber piece of work, not only for the way it confounds and even frustrates certain genre expectations, but also -- and especially -- for the way it confronts the viewer with the moral implications of that frustration."
3986,did-you-hear-about-the-morgans-movie,Richard Corliss,30,The movie is like a car wreck in which no one is injured but the onlookers.
3987,downfall-movie,James Berardinelli,88,Downfall and Bruno Ganz are deserving of Oscars they will not get.
3988,gangs-of-new-york-movie,Rick Groen,63,"While the initial sequence is glorious, the last is a shambles."
3989,the-science-of-sleep-movie,Scott Foundas,80,"For the soul of Gondry's work, it seems to me, is neither its soaring flights of visual fancy nor its sometimes crude slapstick, but rather its pained understanding of a generation hopelessly tongue-tied when it comes to matters of the heart."
3990,the-raven-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"It is, in a word or two, everything that Poe's tales and poems were not: interminable and picayune."
3991,notes-on-a-scandal-movie,Connie Ogle,88,Dench and Blanchett will likely pick up Oscar nominations; no one could improve on either performance.
3992,tokyo-sonata-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"Each performance in this plaintive work is superb, but Kyoko Koizumi's gently melancholy portrait of the businessman's wife keeps Tokyo Sonata true and affecting, even when the later passages go a little nuts."
3993,showtime-movie,Jessica Winter,10,Should come with a disclaimer.
3994,the-last-witch-hunter-movie,Richard Roeper,12,"It’s just deadly and dreadful, loud and obnoxious, convoluted and irritating, horrible and dumb."

3996,the-grace-card-movie,Mike Scott,25,A movie that wears its heart on its sleeve.
3997,house-of-wax-movie,Mike Clark,25,"When the cast starts wondering where the roadkill is, someone says, ""Follow the smell."" Good tip: That's how you'll know where Wax is playing."
3998,seven-days-in-utopia-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"The movie is terrible partly because it's badly written, directed, and conceived and partly because it lacks the necessarily thematic coherence to accomplish proselytism of any kind."
3999,the-ghost-writer-movie,Ann Hornaday,75,Offers an unusually astute glimpse of power at its most alluring and corrosive.
4000,into-the-forest-movie,Jared Mobarak,75,"The journey is nuanced and subtle, though, just like its science-fiction premise. So don’t expect a thrill a minute."
4001,vincere-movie,Rob Nelson,100,"Vincere, though, is the veteran director's stylistic knockout, a movie whose audacious editing fully captures the hot and heavy relationships between past and present, sex and politics, reality and, yes, cinema."
4002,babel-movie,Ty Burr,63,"Babel is a ziggurat of brilliant pieces built on sand. It's also this season's ""Crash,"" a movie you know is Important because it never stops telling you so."
4003,the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-movie,Joe Williams,75,This Swedish sensation is a magic trick that jolts the murder-mystery genre back to life.
4004,the-boy-in-the-striped-pajamas-movie,J.R. Jones,0,"This might have had some potential as a German exercise in self-examination, but as a tony BBC Films production, with the actors all speaking British-accented English (including Jersey girl Farmiga), it reeks of self-righteousness."
4005,bats-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,10,"Hopeless rip-off of Hitchcock's ""The Birds."""
4006,pina-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"What's remarkable about Pina is how democratic it is, how casual it is about opening up the world of modern dance to people who know, or perhaps care, little about it."
4007,untitled-judd-apatow-project-movie,Dana Stevens,30,"At its worst, This Is 40 feels like being condemned to watch two hours of someone else's home movies - overly long, self-indulgent, and bone-crushingly banal. "
4008,mystery-science-theater-3000-the-movie-movie,James Musgrove,90,"The writers are comic geniuses, and the experience is so enjoyable that upon viewing This Island Earth's non-MST3K version, a grin will cross your face as you remember this parody masterpiece."
4009,gone-baby-gone-movie,Lisa Nesselson,70,"Moral ambiguity is the real star of Ben Affleck's helming debut, Gone Baby Gone, an involving Boston-set tale of mixed motives, selflessness and perfidy in the wake of a 4-year-old girl's disappearance."
4010,the-ugly-truth-movie,Manohla Dargis,20,"A cynical, clumsy, aptly titled attempt to cross the female-oriented romantic comedy with the male-oriented gross-out comedy that is interesting on several levels, none having to do with cinema."
4011,anatomy-of-hell-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"Anatomy of Hell is more than a lapse; it is a brutal self-parody of a filmmaker who, having stripped down to the nitty-gritty once too often, may finally have nothing left to show. "
4012,young-beautiful-movie,Anthony Lane,80,"His (Francois Ozon) theme could hardly be less original (think of ""Bonjour Tristesse""), but the tautness is that of a horror film. [5 May 2014, p.85]"
4013,the-dreamers-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"Ablaze with poetry and danger, and suffused with an odd kind of intellectual kitsch."
4014,eureka-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"Eureka demands active attention, but rewards it with emotional resonance, thematic complexity and a succession of images that take up permanent residence in our brains."
4015,fear-of-fiction-movie,Nick Rutigliano,30,"Ahearn's maddening game of connect-the-dots is content to collapse inward with honking, preening abandon."

4017,teachers-pet-movie,Paula Nechak,67,More like the kid shows that populate Nickelodeon. 
4018,janis-little-girl-blue-movie,Roger Moore,88,"A terrific film, not as moving or damning as this year’s Amy Winehouse expose, but a warm piece of cinematic scholarship."
4019,deepwater-horizon-movie,Matt Singer,70,"As a director, Berg is known for his brutal action scenes, and while Deepwater Horizon’s second half is full of intense sequences, the film’s first half is just as exciting thanks to the wonderfully uncomfortable dynamics between Wahlberg, Russell, and Malkovich."
4020,the-fourth-war-movie,John Hartl,25,"Maybe there's a serious movie to be made about professional soldiers who can't thaw out now that the Cold War is melting. But The Fourth War plays like Laurel and Hardy's Tit For Tat in slow motion. [23 Mar 1990, p.24]"
4021,little-boy-movie,Keith Phipps,20,"In some ways it takes the right approach, attempting to mix moral lessons into a narrative rather than hit audiences over the head with them. But the lessons are so pat that every moment in which Pepper makes a good moral choice feels like an act of self-congratulation. "
4022,the-astronaut-farmer-movie,Peter Rainer,25,Some movies are so flagrantly awful that they achieve classic status. To this rarefied company we must now add The Astronaut Farmer.
4023,terminator-genisys-movie,Marc Savlov,30,Terminator: Genisys is a catastrophic misfire on nearly all counts. It’s only saving grace? 2015 Oscar winner J.K. Simmons (Whiplash) as a Mulder-gone-to-pot-esque cop who believes in these “goddamn time-traveling robots.” 
4024,incendies-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"The story might have worked as well without that stick-in-the-craw coincidence, which was inserted to maximize the horrors of Nawal's past."
4025,private-romeo-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"How cheap-looking is the modern-day romantic tragedy Private Romeo? Take a couple of friends to see it, and the amount you spend may exceed the amount the filmmakers did."
4026,jolene-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"So bad it's almost (but not quite) good, Dan Ireland's Jolene is an unusually elaborate and excruciatingly long vanity production based on a short story by E.L. Doctorow (""Ragtime"")."
4027,the-prey-movie,Justin Chang,70,Gallic helmer Eric Valette (“State Affairs”) invests this giddily implausible crime yarn with a propulsive sense of energy.
4028,bee-movie-movie,Andy Spletzer,67,"The riskiest move Seinfeld made was to create an unlikable protagonist who is wrong every step of the way, but treat him like a hero."
4029,one-lucky-elephant-movie,Sheri Linden,80,The film is an impressive and affecting entry in the growing body of work addressing the effects of keeping wild animals in captivity.

4032,the-words-movie,Melissa Anderson,30,"Hoariest of all are the exhortations to make distinctions between ""fiction"" and ""life."""
4033,beyond-the-hills-movie,Stephen Dalton,70,"Beyond the Hills is less fun than any film about lesbian nuns and their psychotic ex-lovers ought to be. But it is an engrossingly serious work, and confirms Mungiu as a maturing talent with more universal stories to tell than those defined by Romania’s recent political past."
4034,my-big-fat-greek-wedding-2-movie,Steve Persall,25,"In 2002, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" was at least a unique cultural take on movie cliches typically reserved for Italian and Jewish squabbles and makeups. Now it's all stale baklava, made with love but past its prime. Opa? Nope-a."
4035,dirty-love-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"The rest of the cast is uniformly awful, including Carmen Electra and Kathy Griffin as a wacky medium who asks, ""What do I look like? A comedian?"" Not from where I'm sitting."
4036,tusk-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,Tusk seems to harbor no grander ambitions than to create a gross-out gag.
4037,jackass-3-d-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Oh, and one more thing the comedy of Jackass 3D has in common with ""The Divine Comedy"": Neither of them is funny."
4038,our-idiot-brother-movie,Roger Moore,63,"The unfailing sweetness of Paul Rudd's lead performance makes what could have been another raunchy and rude R-rated farce a bracing change of pace in a summer of aggressive comedies about aggressive people, from ""Bad Teachers""  to ""Horrible Bosses."""
4039,capote-movie,James Berardinelli,88,The brilliance of Bennett's movie is that it concentrates on the characters and their interaction and never becomes a mouthpiece for one side or the other with respect to the death penalty.
4040,dont-be-afraid-of-the-dark-movie,Mike Scott,63,"One major reason it succeeds is because of 11-year-old actress Bailee Madison, who brings a wonderful believability to her role as the girl at the center of the film."
4041,entourage-movie,Mark Olsen,30,That the bonds of friendship between Vince and his pals are predicated so strongly on excluding others feels regressive and drags the movie away from harmless high jinks into something needlessly more spiteful and ugly.
4042,life-during-wartime-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,85,"Jagged and gentle, shocking and sweet, Life During Wartime finds the King of Cringe more concerned than usual about forgiveness: who deserves it, and who is capable of bestowing it. True to form, though, he's not telling."
4043,cold-comfort-farm-movie,Emanuel Levy,100,"The fun that Schlesinger and his first-rate ensemble must have had while working on this production is infectious, for there isn't one dull -- or quiet -- moment in the film."

4047,the-emoji-movie-movie,Alissa Wilkinson,10,"The Emoji Movie is a waste of time, resources, and a bunch of comedians’ voices, plus a premise that actually had the potential to do some small good in the world. It’s less of a movie and more of an insult."
4048,the-pink-panther-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,0,Sellers' comic mastery is completely fumbled by Martin and director Shawn Levy.
4049,lovely-amazing-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,"This trio is like a looser, funnier version of the family of wrecks in Woody Allen's ''Interiors.''"
4050,the-bounty-hunter-movie,Steve Persall,25,None of these complaints would matter if The Bounty Hunter possessed even a smidgen of inspired comedy. It doesn't.

4052,before-the-devil-knows-youre-dead-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"One bad idea can unravel and ruin lives in unimaginably horrific ways.That's the concept underlying the riveting Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, a sharply acted and highly entertaining morality play."

4056,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,Jay Carr,38,"Berlinger has approached Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 with intelligence and even a bit of thematic heft. But, frankly, the cheap thrill is gone."
4057,norm-of-the-north-movie,Soren Andersen,12,No child should be exposed to this.
4058,the-bounty-hunter-movie,Marc Savlov,0,Barely worthy of a legitimate theatrical release.
4059,zipper-movie,Richard Roeper,38,Zipper might be entertaining enough in a campy way for you to watch it on demand as long as you’ve got a really big bowl of popcorn and an even bigger glass of wine (or the non-alcoholic elixir of your choice) to get you through. Might. Be.
4060,true-crime-movie,Rick Groen,38,"On the whole, the film is content to lumber awkwardly between the condemned man on death row and the intrepid reporter on his save-a-life beat -- there's about as much rhythm in the style as there is sense in the plot."
4061,adaptation-movie,Stephen Hunter,100,Surely the most creative trick of the year and grimly funny throughout.
4062,a-royal-night-out-movie,Roger Moore,63,"The surprises are few, and none of it am0unts to a whole lot. But for those up to taking yet another British sentimental journey to “their finest hour,” A Royal Night Out manages something unheard of in the decades of Windsor wooliness since. It makes them cute, if only for one night."
4063,clockers-movie,Mike Clark,63,"Lee captures the despair, self-delusion, occasional terror and frequent humor of a praised and popular novel, aided by the potent acting his direction virtually guarantees. [13 Sep 1995, p.01.D]"
4064,the-way-of-the-gun-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,"A lot of uninteresting and unpleasant people torture, abuse, and fire guns at a lot of other uninteresting and unpleasant people, in a repulsive, interminable would-be crime thriller."
4065,boat-trip-movie,David Rooney,10,"Washout. Lacking the mojo even to be offensive in its stereotypical view of gays and women, this excruciating cocktail of sitcom plotting and gross-out humor makes a clunky cheesefest like ""The Love Boat"" look like breezy, sophisticated fun."
4066,jawbreaker-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"Jawbreaker has all the heart and soul of last week's mystery loaf (a dish that made the weekly rounds at my alma mater, sadly). And like that unidentifiable bovine by-product, the film is a chilly, messy anti-treat, sweet on the outside, sickly on the in."
4067,no-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"Like ""Argo"" or ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" the film dramatizes a fertile subject — in this instance, the language of advertising in modern politics."
4068,support-the-girls-movie,Roger Moore,63,"The movie feels lived in, greasy and real. [Bujalski] just needed more funny lines and help figuring out the most promising thread among the many he introduces to pursue."
4069,top-five-movie,Nathan Rabin,70,"It’s a big leap forward for Rock as both an actor and a filmmaker, written and directed with the nervous, live-wire energy that has eluded his on-screen work for so long. "
4070,superman-returns-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"The film has such an expansive, likeable spirit."
4071,her-movie,Manohla Dargis,100,"At once a brilliant conceptual gag and a deeply sincere romance, Her is the unlikely yet completely plausible love story about a man, who sometimes resembles a machine, and an operating system, who very much suggests a living woman."
4072,basquiat-movie,David Sterritt,75,"Written and directed by Julian Schnabel, himself a gifted painter, this is one of the rare art-world movies that succeeds as both human drama and visual artistry."
4073,me-and-you-and-everyone-we-know-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,88,"Disturbing, maddening, often confusing, but also charming, engaging and challenging in all the best ways."
4074,daddys-home-2-movie,Tim Grierson,30,"Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are a lot less fun this time around, paired with a fumbling John Lithgow and a stiff Mel Gibson as their overbearing fathers who stop by for the holidays."
4075,letters-to-juliet-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,25,"Save yourself 10 bucks, and an hour and 45 minutes of your precious time."
4076,the-outsiders-movie,Dave Kehr,10,"Francis Ford Coppola's gang film is as moony about death as ""One From the Heart"" was over romance; the film is unremitting in its morbid sentimentality, running its teenage characters through a masochistic gamut of beatings, killings, burnings, and suicides."
4077,the-imaginarium-of-doctor-parnassus-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"As unusual and idiosyncratic as its one-of-a-kind title. You'd expect no less from Terry Gilliam, and admirers of this singular filmmaker will be pleased to know that ""Imaginarium"" is one of his most original and accessible works."
4078,metroland-movie,Ella Taylor,10,"Replete with false dilemmas, assisted by a dreadfully stagy screenplay and directed with all the animation of a tableau vivant, Metroland is such a draggy bore."
4079,in-the-valley-of-elah-movie,Claudia Puig,88,A rare blend of emotional content and intelligent material that makes it simultaneously gut-wrenching and thought-provoking.
4080,dont-think-twice-movie,Joe Dziemianowicz,70,"Jack and Sam share a wonderful scene when performance and real life blur, which is the whole point of the movie."
4081,city-of-ghosts-2017-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,"Director Matthew Heineman (“Cartel Land”) sticks with the group as it moves from strategy meetings to safe houses, documenting not only its political commitment but also intimate moments of reflection."
4082,the-spirit-movie,Peter Hartlaub,0,Throwing your $10.25 down a storm drain is a better idea; at least that way you won't feel the added self-loathing of wasting more than an hour and a half of your life watching Eva Mendes in the worst acting job of her career.
4083,alice-through-the-looking-glass-movie,Drew McWeeny,33,"I think it is precisely because the technical work by everyone from James Bobin down is so good that I find myself infuriated by the film. So much muscle, so much effort, so much raw talent on display, and all in service of demographic-and-merchandise-driven garbage that sullies the name of the source material. "
4084,batman-begins-movie,Mike Clark,63,"The early going -- say, an hour -- is spent in a fatigued daze. A few powerful jabs eventually punch things up."
4085,act-of-valor-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"Act of Valor is like watching the wrestlers in dramas produced by the WWE: They're great at what they do, but being in front of the camera isn't part of that."
4086,the-cloverfield-paradox-movie,Justin Chang,30,"Narrative incompetence is one of the more venial sins of big-budget filmmaking, but there is something particularly ugly and cynical about the sloppiness of The Cloverfield Paradox, as if its status as a franchise stepping stone excused its blithe contempt for the audience's satisfaction."
4087,waging-a-living-movie,V.A. Musetto,75,"Weisberg is nonjudgmental, allowing his subjects to deliver the message that, for far too many people, the American dream is more of a nightmare."
4088,patriots-day-movie,Steve Greene,75,"Historians, media scholars and even Boston citizens may debate whether this is the most worthy way to honor those fallen in the attacks. But Berg mounts a heartfelt, harrowing tribute to the film’s real-life heroes."
4089,the-salton-sea-movie,Keith Phipps,20,"A grimy mess set among L.A.'s speed-abusing ""tweakers,"" Salton has neither the substance to justify first-time feature director D.J. Caruso's pretentious flourishes, nor the skill to make those flourishes work on their own terms."
4090,the-last-airbender-movie,Keith Phipps,0,"The Last Airbender isn't that much different from the rest of this summer's generally dire multiplex fare-from ""The A-Team"" to ""Jonah Hex""... But it is remarkable in one respect: It's the worst of them."
4091,bandits-1999-movie,Andrew Curry,25,"A confused mess of music video montages drowns out the rest of the action, depicting the foursome in a variety of sexy romps that clash with the plot."
4092,john-wick-movie,Drew McWeeny,83,"John Wick won't redefine action movies, but it perfectly exemplifies what I want from an action film when I go. Have fun with the world, shoot the action well, motivate it in a way that doesn't feel cheap."
4093,the-muppets-movie,Dana Stevens,80,"Like Statler and Waldorf, older viewers may kvetch and cavil about the details, but when that red velvet curtain goes up, we wouldn't give up our balcony seats for the world."
4094,dark-horse-movie,David Denby,80,"Abe is blustery and self-pitying, but, with Solondz's new tender mercies fully engaged, Gelber makes you feel close to a guy for whom nothing was ever meant to go right."
4095,wish-upon-movie,Edward Douglas,20,Wish Upon is dull because it never goes far enough to truly scare anyone. 
4096,american-made-movie,Jim Vejvoda,75,"Featuring one of Tom Cruise's best performances in recent years, American Made is a darkly funny, dizzying crime film that nevertheless ultimately feels inconsequential and overly familiar."
4097,bride-wars-movie,Olivia Putnal,88,"Sometimes the only funny stuff is in the trailers, but not so here. Kristen Johnson was especially adept at stealing some scenes."
4098,gods-not-dead-a-light-in-darkness-movie,David Ehrlich,25,"It has to be said that “A Light in Darkness” is considerably better than the two movies that preceded it. Mason, in stark contrast to OG franchise director Harold Cronk, actually knows how to frame a shot like he’s ever actually seen a film before. Corbett also lends a real credibility to the scenes between Reverend Dave and his brother."
4099,love-friendship-movie,Richard Roeper,88,Stillman has done a marvelous job of adapting Austen’s novella Lady Susan and capturing the author’s tart and rapier-sharp sense of humor.
4100,liberty-heights-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"This is a small, intimate movie bound to get lost in the holiday shuffle, but its pleasures are worth seeking out."
4101,kiss-of-the-dragon-movie,Jami Bernard,63,"The action scenes, including one on that tourist sightseeing staple, the Bateau Mouche, were directed by Cory Yuen with some creative touches, including a hail of chopsticks during a fight in a restaurant kitchen."
4102,lymelife-movie,M. E. Russell,67,"Lymelife is more shaggy character study than rewarding narrative; its fateful final moments are self-consciously ambiguous in a way that (to me) feel almost flip, given the long dramatic build that preceded those final moments."
4103,phantom-thread-movie,William Bibbiani,88,"Gorgeous and unpredictable, and maybe a little indulgent, Phantom Thread is another fascinating drama from Paul Thomas Anderson, with captivating lead performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps."
4104,an-american-affair-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,I have no idea how such shameless prattle found its way to the screen.
4105,sisters-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Going into Sisters, the thought is, “It’s Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. How bad can it be?” Going out, the thought is, “Now we know.” It can be downright awful."
4106,antitrust-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,30,This compression of logic--coupled with two hours of ham-fisted delivery--guarantees that Antitrust won't jangle your nerves but will intermittently split your sides with laughter.
4107,enough-said-movie,Ty Burr,100,"You could argue that Gandolfini doesn’t have enough screen time, but what’s there is, as they say, cherce. The scenes in which Albert and Eva get to know each other are delightful miniatures of emotional intimacy, two bruised romantics amazed to find someone still on their wavelength. "
4108,rampage-movie,Glenn Kenny,20,"You know what might make an intriguing, revealing movie? The story of how, over 30 years after its debut, a relatively innocent arcade game starring a giant ape and other oversize beasts underwent a corporate transmogrification and became a turgid, logy sci-fi/action blockbuster."
4109,godzilla-1998-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"Size vanquishes both substance and subtlety in the overhyped, half-cocked and humorless resurrection of dear old ""Godzilla."" "
4110,when-will-i-be-loved-movie,Ann Hornaday,20,It's trivial and narcissistic and ultimately rather sordid. 
4111,take-me-home-tonight-movie,Steven Rea,38,"Nostalgia for the '80s - big hair, Madonna, cocaine, big hair, Duran Duran, more cocaine - is all well and good. Unless it's practiced with the charmless ineptitude of Take Me Home Tonight."
4112,machete-kills-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,Machete Kills? “Machete Bores” is more like it.
4113,mongol-the-rise-of-genghis-khan-movie,William Arnold,83,"The casting also works. As the Khan, Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano (""Zatoichi"") is all effortless charisma, and Chinese actor Honglei Sun (as his best friend-turned-enemy) and Mongolian actress Khulan Chuluun (as his faithful wife, Borte) are just as effective."
4114,beverly-hills-ninja-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Nearly as much fun as a case of scabies, Beverly Hills Ninja transports the viewer into a mystical realm where pratfall is king and mediocrity is its own reward."
4115,a-very-brady-sequel-movie,Jay Carr,63,"A Very Brady Sequel is a little like the meatloaf prepared by Alice, the Bradys' maid - padded, but palatable. It walks a line between evoking the old TV show and kidding it and it's as surprisingly lively a sequel as the original was for a big-screen treatment of an old TV staple. [23 Aug 1996, p.F4]"
4116,first-descent-movie,James C. Taylor,30,"Hardcore fans will appreciate the handful of genuinely gnarly aerial sequences, but these gravity-defying stunts, which can be thrilling as part of a five-minute James Bond pre-credit sequence, grow very tedious when repeated over almost two hours."
4117,chasing-papi-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,Frantic and unfunny.
4118,the-wedding-date-movie,Mike Clark,38,The movie goes wrong from the start.
4119,hacksaw-ridge-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"The war scenes in Hacksaw Ridge, which take up almost half the screen time, are almost on a level with the D-Day invasion sequence from “Saving Private Ryan.”"
4120,the-little-mermaid-movie,Jay Boyar,88,Fun-and-fin-filled feature-length Disney cartoon that revitalized the studio's animation department.
4121,the-neon-demon-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,70,"The Neon Demon isn’t much of movie, at least if you’re looking for an actual story. Nor is it a moralistic fable about the emptiness of Hollywood—if anything, it’s a winking mockery of that sort of thing. But whatever the heck it is, it throws off a chilly, pleasurable sheen. This is visual hard candy."
4122,the-cloverfield-paradox-movie,Tasha Robinson,29,"Unlike the first two films in the series, Cloverfield Paradox doesn’t stand on its own as a horror movie, or even as a standalone story. There’s no central idea, no governing principle, and more to the point, virtually nothing frightening about it. No one involved in creating this movie seemed to have any clue what kind of tale it’s telling from one minute to the next."
4123,the-child-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,100,One of the greatest films of recent years.
4124,collateral-beauty-movie,Eric Henderson,12,David Frankel's film argues that the power of miracles can be manufactured by those who can fund them.
4125,get-hard-movie,Michael Phillips,25,"It's a mystery why two bona fide comic stars, working very, very hard to keep this thing from tanking, couldn't pressure their collaborators for another rewrite or three. "
4126,goodbye-to-language-3d-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Dr. Godard drops and quotes more names than you’d find in a week’s worth of Page Six, but lots of luck figuring any of this out before dozing off. The good thing about Goodbye to Language is that you’ll wake up with no side effects, albeit your wallet will be $12 lighter."
4127,to-save-a-life-movie,Andy Webster,10,The film would be a mere nuisance if not for its shameless exploitation of school shootings to advance its agenda.
4128,21-movie,Robert Wilonsky,30,"A movie that wastes a lot of time and money and really, REALLY shoulda stayed in Vegas."
4129,chronicles-movie,Joshua Katzman,80,The ironic twist at the conclusion of this chilling drama underscores the vagaries of human nature--and of the media.
4130,pitch-black-movie,Sara Wildberger,63,Just may be the most entertainingly derivative movie of the millennium so far.
4131,staying-vertical-movie,Mike D'Angelo,91,"Staying Vertical is distinguished largely by its poker-faced playfulness. Bonnard is a wonderfully quizzical presence in the lead, expertly creating the impression of a person who has no idea what he wants but is nonetheless determined to get it."
4132,gifted-movie,Frank Scheck,70,"Despite its recycled tropes, the comedy-drama manages to be both funny and moving even if its emotional manipulations are fully apparent."
4133,aquarius-movie,Giovanni Marchini Camia,91,"Clara is the film’s heroine and Braga deserves high praise for her phenomenal performance. Stately, headstrong, and all-too-recognizably human, she’s a delight to watch from start to finish, keeping the viewer mesmerized by her charisma and intensely rooting for her victory."
4134,why-we-fight-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"This rehash of familiar pacifist arguments offers neither heat nor light. It's ""Fahrenheit: Room Temperature."""
4135,clash-of-the-titans-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,Can't overcome mythic stupidity.
4136,let-the-sunshine-in-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"The movie is all a bit more airy than it needs to be, but Isabelle’s startlements are like a double take that never lets up."
4137,blade-runner-2049-movie,John Bleasdale,100,Blade Runner 2049 is not a perfect film. The pace occasionally puts the plod in the procedural and some story elements are introduced only to drift away to the land of possible sequels. But Villeneuve has created a genuinely thoughtful piece of sci-fi which escapes the gravitational pull of its inspiration to become something - to paraphrase Dr. Eldon Tyrrell - more Blade Runner than Blade Runner.
4138,snow-flower-and-the-secret-fan-movie,Stephanie Merry,38,The books-trump-movies camp knows where this is headed: The film version -  contains two characters and one narrative too many. 
4139,the-house-of-yes-movie,John Anderson,70,"In addition to its terrifically bratty performance by the epically bratty Posey, House of Yes contains some of the smarter (and smarter-assed) writing of the year."
4140,kings-movie,Odie Henderson,12,"If you want to see the 1992 Los Angeles riots turned into a bad sitcom and an even worse Lifetime movie, buy a ticket to Kings."
4141,the-truth-about-lies-movie,Roger Moore,38,If this movie was better it might make rom coms great again. But I cannot lie. It won’t.
4142,of-gods-and-men-movie,Mark Jenkins,90,"Although the monks don't seek death, Of Gods And Men can be seen as an ode to religiously motivated self-sacrifice. But Beauvois deliberately leaves the story open-ended. The value of these men's lives, he's noting, is not defined by how they ended."
4143,stealth-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,"What's interesting about Stealth isn't its nitwit story... No, what's interesting about this movie - and many others of its kind - is that it continues the love affair Hollywood, that hotbed of liberalism, has long had with militarism."
4144,a-united-kingdom-movie,Roger Moore,63,"It makes for a warm history lesson about a country and a love affair that prefigured a change in a corner of the world where the news, for decades, was dominated by violence, injustice and fear."
4145,hollow-man-movie,Marc Caro,38,"The folks who made this movie apparently had nothing inside their heads, either."
4146,days-of-thunder-movie,Sheila Benson,20,"You can leave Days of Thunder feeling positively chafed. That clanking noise, however, comes from Robert Towne's tinny story and its malnourished characters. [27 Jun 1990, p.1]"
4147,flight-of-the-phoenix-movie,Stephen Holden,20,"A moth-eaten stranded-in-the-desert yarn that throws in every cheap trick in the manual to pump up your heartbeat, is so manipulative that the involuntary jolts of adrenaline it produces make you feel like a fool. "
4148,burn-after-reading-movie,J.R. Jones,100,"After the portentous ""No Country for Old Men,"" Joel and Ethan Coen return to their trademark brand of cruel, misanthropic farce, and for dark laughs and hurtling narrative momentum this spy caper is their best work since ""Fargo."""
4149,blood-simple-movie,Ernest Hardy,70,"All these years later, the film is far more infuriating than it is exciting."
4150,teen-titans-go!-to-the-movies-movie,Roger Moore,38,"The animation’s so flat, static and dull it relies on brighter-than-bright sparkly colors to make it pop. Like “Power Puff Girls” or “My Little Pony.” The jokes are infantile-obvious and pounded home with a sledgehammer, as if the writers figured they had to get through something especially thick."
4151,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,Kenneth Turan,0,Doomed to be inconsequential and forgettable.
4152,the-road-warrior-movie,Josh Larsen,100,"Part post-apocalyptic Western, part midnight motorcycle flick and part Rocky Horror Picture Show, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is, when you add it all up, a nutty, B-movie masterpiece."
4153,adaptation-movie,David Edelstein,70,"I'm not turning cartwheels over Adaptation as energetically as my colleagues. Part of me -- and I'm thinking aloud here, I've likely been infected by Kaufman's comic self-consciousness, and also by his meta-comic impulse to draw attention to that self-consciousness, and probably also by his meta-meta-comic impulse to draw attention to drawing attention to his self-consciousness -- that -- that --"
4154,hansel-and-gretel-witch-hunters-movie,Peter Travers,0,"What to say about this lame-brained, limp dick attempt to update a classic Brothers Grimm tale into an f-bomb throwing vomit-inducing 3D franchise? I say, screw the damn thing and run the other way."
4155,the-other-boleyn-girl-movie,Matthew Sorrento,10,"The falling blade is the only element not missing the mark in this film. I wanted to call for the beheading after Act One, and spare the audience instead."
4156,the-untold-story-of-emmett-louis-till-movie,David Sterritt,100,Required viewing for anyone interested in the struggle for American racial equality.
4157,harry-is-here-to-help-movie,Kimberley Jones,78,Appropriately belongs to Lopez. His mannequin glaze and never-wavering smile provide more creepy-crawlies than a thousand quivering violins or perfectly timed thunderclaps.
4158,a-decade-under-the-influence-movie,John Powers,30,"One wonders what exactly Richard LaGravenese and the late Ted Demme thought they were doing in this documentary, which doesn't so much look at the period as genuflect before it. "
4159,series-7-the-contenders-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"Wide-eyed, deadpan and, more often than not, note-perfect."
4160,custody-movie,Danny King,70,"Legrand demonstrates great skill as a tactician in this closing third, but his overarching framework for Custody — with its considerable reliance on is-he-or-isn’t-he uncertainty — demands that he sacrifice interior perspectives. "
4161,beautiful-movie,Jessica Winter,0,"Surpassing Dan Aykroyd's ""Nothing but Trouble"" as the most astoundingly atrocious walrus-flop of a directorial debut by a languishing actor ever contrived, Sally Field's Beautiful."
4162,little-black-book-movie,Jason Anderson,38,"The finale just seems hypocritical, even nonsensical in a comedy that derives its few laughs from a farting dog and an accidental gynecological exam. This book is better left closed."
4163,spider-man-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"Every action adventure needs a memorable villain, but no movie needs the strident intensity of Mr. Dafoe, who either has no interest in, or no grasp of, the sort of charmingly malign wit that Gene Hackman brought to ""Superman,"" or Jack Nicholson to ""Batman."""
4164,creed-movie,A.O. Scott,100,"Creed is a dandy piece of entertainment, soothingly old-fashioned and bracingly up-to-date. "
4165,therese-movie,Kaleem Aftab,0,It takes a special talent to turn the romantic lyricism of Zola and turn it into chick-lit.
4166,annie-2014-movie,Eric Henderson,12,"2014: Annie's America makes director John Huston's elephantine, synthetically charismatic 1982 adaptation look like a Minnelliesque model of focus and concision."
4167,sleepless-movie,Roger Moore,38,"It’s altogether ridiculous, made all the sadder because we’ve seen this ridiculousness before."
4168,ride-along-2-movie,Eric Henderson,25,"Like any serving of junk food, it seems engineered to give you that initial rush of satisfaction, but leaves you in a dead zone where the only thing you want is more of the same."
4169,iron-island-movie,Sean Axmaker,100,Director Mohammad Rasoulof has fashioned the ultimate metaphor for a society adrift from its culture.
4170,high-school-movie,Amy Biancolli,25,"The screenplay is so cognitively impaired that the filmmakers might have been better off hacking up ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and then sticking together random bits with masking tape. At least that would have made some sense."
4171,vhs-movie,Eric Kohn,100,"Most segments have a fair share of cheap scares, but they also delve into the art of the build-up, as if delivering a series of grim jokes with bloody punchlines. Consider it a 21st-century take on ""Tales from the Crypt."" "
4172,flipped-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Flipped is Rob Reiner's best film in 18 years, and includes echoes of two of his most accomplished efforts, ""The Sure Thing"" and ""Stand By Me."" "
4173,say-it-isnt-so-movie,Peter Travers,10,A script by Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow that is minus a shred of Farrelly wit.

4175,10-movie,Gary Arnold,30,"A sporadically funny, marginally interesting fiasco that might have evolved into a memorable romantic comedy."
4176,top-five-movie,Steve Persall,100,"Top Five is the funniest movie I've seen this year, and the calendar's running out. No matter whose movie Rock's resembles, it is completely his, and a brash start to being taken seriously as an artist."
4177,investigation-of-a-citizen-above-suspicion-re-release-movie,Keith Phipps,80,"As specific as the film is to Italy at the turn of the turbulent 1970s, it’s also a film about how power first corrupts, then makes mad those who possess it."
4178,birdman-or-the-unexpected-virtue-of-ignorance-movie,Mike Scott,100,"From the first line of its deep, rapid-fire dialog all the way through to its trippy ending -- which is guaranteed prompt discussion on the drive home -- Inarritu has crafted a film that begs to be rewatched, with the promise of each repeated viewing bringing something new."
4179,the-hunted-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,The only prize this shamelessly derivative schlock is likely to be in the running for is the year's dullest thriller. 
4180,the-loss-of-a-teardrop-diamond-movie,Betsy Sharkey,70,"Despite Teardrop Diamond's rough edges, the filmmaker, who has spent much of her career acting on stage and screen, succeeds in transporting us back to that other time; capturing the lyricism of the dialogue and the fetid South that Williams so brilliantly envisioned where nearly everything goes to rot."
4181,new-years-eve-movie,Peter Travers,0,Bad beyond belief.
4182,the-libertine-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,The Libertine is such a torturous mess that it winds up doing something I hadn't thought possible: It renders Johnny Depp charmless.
4183,blue-jasmine-movie,David Denby,80,"Cate Blanchett, who played Blanche on Broadway only a few years ago, gives the most complicated and demanding performance of her movie career. The actress, like her character, is out on a limb much of the time, but there’s humor in Blanchett’s work, and a touch of self-mockery as well as an eloquent sadness."
4184,the-mod-squad-movie,Liam Lacey,0,"A flawed fraud, a youth movie so disjointed, witless and condescending that it's painful to watch."
4185,dawn-of-the-dead-movie,Michael Wilmington,38,"Despite a big budget, lots of technical flair and a good cast headed by Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames, it's mostly a bloody mess."
4186,the-body-movie,Kevin Thomas,10,"Despite a premise that's provocative, to say the least, this one's a dud."
4187,high-tension-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"Such a bizarre movie that it has completely occupied my thinking for days. Not because it's a good movie, mind you. It's more like the equivalent of a botched tooth extraction with a coat hanger. Some bloody shard remains stuck in an inflamed, fleshy part of my psyche, and it's going to take some serious tugging and tearing to root it out."
4188,exodus-gods-and-kings-movie,Drew McWeeny,33,"This is that rare case where it feels like every choice Scott made was off, and the cumulative impact of all of these choices is one of the most crushing disappointments of the year in terms of who made the film and how little of it works."
4189,captain-fantastic-movie,Steve Persall,91,"Anchored by Viggo Mortensen's prismatic portrayal of Ben, this is one of the summer's nicest movie surprises, and among its wisest."
4190,the-pianist-movie,Ty Burr,100,"There are three Poles in The Pianist -- Szpilman, Polanski, and Frederic Chopin. Of the three, fittingly, Chopin speaks the loudest."
4191,pride-2014-movie,Bob Mondello,80,"It says something that 30 years after the events it depicts, Pride should feel so unexpectedly rousing. People cooperating across ideological lines? Finding common cause with folks they don't 100 percent agree with? What a concept."
4192,star-wars-episode-vi---return-of-the-jedi-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"Cuteness is the watchword here. The dark, eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is gone. Instead, for Return of the Jedi, we have good triumphing decisively over evil, a too-pat resolution to a love triangle, and walking teddy bears."
4193,the-last-house-on-the-left-1972-movie,Keith Phipps,83,"Wes Craven's The Last House On The Left occasionally plays like the longest, grisliest drug-scare film ever made. "
4194,punch-drunk-love-movie,Robert Wilonsky,80,"Anderson and Sandler were meant for each other, and their romance is, unbelievably, our reward."
4195,wild-west-comedy-show-30-days-30-nights---hollywood-to-the-heartland-movie,Nathan Rabin,33,"West is heavy on Vaughn, at least initially, but woefully short on comedy."
4196,awake-movie,Jack Mathews,0,Possibly the worst movie of 2007.
4197,sabotage-movie,Jordan Hoffman,10,"Does this mean that Sabotage is a rich, morally complex story about the gray zone between good and evil? Hell, no. It just means it is a bungle."
4198,judy-berlin-movie,Jonathan Foreman,63,"Boasts several fine performances and some elegant, eerie black-and- white photography."
4199,nobody-knows-movie,Jim Healy,90,"Yuya Yagira, winner of the best actor award at Cannes this year, is superb as the protective eldest child; he and his other nonprofessional costars are quietly heartbreaking."
4200,kikujiro-no-natsu-movie,Desson Thomson,10,The episodes are too convoluted to get into.
4201,ruby-sparks-movie,Kate Taylor,75,"The meta-fiction concept of characters interacting with their creator is hardly original, but it's neatly packaged here by Kazan herself, who wrote the script for this clever little charmer."
4202,hateship-loveship-movie,Richard Roeper,88,Kristen Wiig’s performance in the unfortunately titled Hateship Loveship is so beautifully muted it takes a while to appreciate the loveliness of the notes she’s hitting.
4203,jerry-maguire-movie,Elvis Mitchell,90,"Jerry Maguire is loaded with them: bright, funny, tender encounters between characters who seem so winningly warm and real. [13 December 1996, p.C-1]"
4204,austin-powers-the-spy-who-shagged-me-movie,Rita Kempley,70,"With its outrageous double-entendre, gonzo performances and appalling lack of restraint, the sequel is more than a guilty pleasure."
4205,88minutes-movie,Andrea Gronvall,30,Al Pacino chews up so much scenery it's surprising there's any left by the end of this fetid thriller.
4206,the-mummy-tomb-of-the-dragon-emperor-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,20,It's impossible to tell what's going on at any given moment in Tomb of the Dragon Emperor; it's even harder to care about being able to tell.
4207,47-ronin-movie,David Ehrlich,5,"Insufferably boring, culturally hegemonic, and profoundly ugly."
4208,you-were-never-really-here-movie,Jessica Kiang,100,"The entire, whippet-lean film feels like an experiment in impressionist condensation, as though Ramsay is testing the limits of how little she can give us, and how weird it can be, while still delivering a recognisable revenge thriller."
4209,the-emperors-new-groove-movie,Robert Koehler,80,"Light, taut and compact, the zippy adventure is sometimes much too hip for the room."
4210,stargate-movie,Steven Rea,63,"The movie devolves into a kind of high-tech Flash Gordon, with Ra as a cross- dressed Ming and Russell and Spader as the heroes required to chase big lugs with ray-guns around the inside of a pyramid. Things get pretty brainless before it's over, although Russell does get to deliver a great send-off line. [28 Oct 1994, p.5]"
4211,stealth-movie,Ty Burr,12,"For a movie to pretend, in the face of the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi men, women, and children directly or indirectly caused by our presence there, that we can wage war without anyone really getting hurt isn't naive, or wishful thinking, or a jim-dandy way to spend a Saturday night at the movies. It's an obscenity."
4212,saving-silverman-movie,Stephen Hunter,0,One thing the makers of Saving Silverman do not have to worry about: Hannibal Lecter will never visit them to eat their brains. That is because they have no brains.
4213,on-her-majestys-secret-service-movie,Geoff Andrew,30,"The Bond films were bad enough even with the partially ironic performances of Connery. Here, featuring the stunning nonentity Lazenby, there are no redeeming features. "
4214,whats-the-worst-that-could-happen-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"Dull, plodding comedy."
4215,uncle-boonmee-who-can-recall-his-past-lives-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"Spirit, animal, and human worlds coexist in dreamy harmony in this remarkable drama."
4216,the-last-house-on-the-left-movie,Sean Axmaker,75,Iliadis is more visually sophisticated than Craven was in 1972 and works hard to sustain the mood and tension while still hitting the audience with blunt scenes of wincing violence. (It gets grisly and grotesque enough for gore hounds.)
4217,pepe-le-moko-re-release-movie,Jami Bernard,88,"The movie elevated the basic gangster picture into what became known as the niche genre of poetic realism. And, aside from Garbo, never have key lights on a star's face caused so much swooning among fans."
4218,swat-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"A prototypical new-millennium summer movie, S.W.A.T. is no more than an extended trailer for itself. "
4219,night-at-the-museum-secret-of-the-tomb-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,The aptly subtitled Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is a blast of dead air and mummified humor.
4220,lincoln-movie,Roger Ebert,100,Rarely has a film attended more carefully to the details of politics.
4221,nobody-knows-movie,Derek Elley,80,"Kore-eda sketches the inner, spiritual and emotional lives of the children with subtlety and sensitivity, delivering the goods after a seemingly directionless first half."
4222,the-darkest-minds-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"The movie is 105 minutes long but seems about 45 minutes longer, with uneventful stretches and at least three sections where the action stops for musical interludes featuring goopy pop music."
4223,kicking-screaming-movie,Steven Rea,63,"For soccer aficionados, Kicking & Screaming boasts some fairly cool play, courtesy of Alessandro Ruggiero and Francesco Liotti, two kids who play ""the Italians."""
4224,the-notebook-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"A lovely surprise. Ripe with feeling and lush with physical beauty, it's a love story that swings confidently between age and youth, and, like the young Tiger Woods of old, avoids every trap along the way."
4225,how-i-killed-my-father-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,100,"The most disturbing and effective thriller I've seen in many moons. Rarely, indeed almost never, is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite, unfakable sense of cinema."
4226,the-replacements-movie,Tom Keogh,10,"Merely reconfigures the same predictable gross-out jokes, sentimental platitudes, and decorative sex that figure into half the screenplays in circulation."
4227,the-nice-guys-movie,Russ Fischer,91,"The Nice Guys, which the screenwriter also directed, is the best of Black’s films. It is eccentrically, sometimes broadly funny, with top-notch performances from Crowe and Gosling and a pitch-perfect sense of timing to help smooth over some of the script’s fault lines and blind spots."
4228,la-la-land-movie,Matt Singer,90,"With infectious enthusiasm, charismatic leads, gorgeous songs, vibrant colors, and dazzling camerawork, La La Land restores the original movie musical to its former glory."
4229,battle-for-terra-movie,Ethan Gilsdorf,38,"Please, moviegoers, time is running out for us. Our civilization (and bottom line) depend on fast-food kiddie meals stuffed with toys. In this way, we conquer the solar system."
4230,behaving-badly-movie,Sheila O'Malley,25,What a grim experience.
4231,big-fish-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"A long-winded indulgence in tear-and-a-smile whimsy, elevated above the merely irritating and saccharine by compelling art direction."
4232,tiny-furniture-movie,Rex Reed,0,Lena Dunham makes a 98-minute home video seem like 98 days of hard labor.
4233,disobedience-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,75,"Plotting has never been a strong suit for Lelio, who made his name with character studies of unconventional women. Here, he tries his hand at something akin to classicism, and ends up mounting a compelling drama. Curiously, its main shortcoming parallels the human flaw that is its main theme: our yearning to leave often loses out to our inability to let go."
4234,iron-island-movie,Peter Rainer,91,"All in all, a harrowing, one-of-a-kind movie."
4235,stuck-on-you-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,70,Much of this is hilarious as long as one can stay sufficiently removed from the realities of Siamese twins. 
4236,gone-movie,John DeFore,30,"A thriller so fixated on red herrings that viewers may stop caring if anyone's really in danger, Gone is diverting but unlikely to linger long in theaters."
4237,dark-horse-2016-movie,Peter Bradshaw,80,"With its sheer warmth and likability, this good-natured documentary won my heart."
4238,tron-legacy-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"It's dispiriting to see how little attention the filmmakers have paid to the dramatic - read human - possibilities of the original, or how much they've been overwhelmed by technology's demands. It's as though rogue programs took over the production."
4239,the-devils-rejects-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,"The movie's signal flaw -- that is, other than its degeneracy, its sloppiness, its love of dark things and pretty stains and arterial spray patterns -- is Moseley as the demonic Otis."
4240,breach-movie,Maitland McDonagh,75,"Phillippe has the unenviable task of trying to make O'Neill equally interesting, but an eager beaver with some unresolved family issues is no match for a poisoned soul methodically laying the groundwork for his own inevitable fall. The unfortunate imbalance makes long stretches of the film feel dull, but when Cooper is on screen it's mesmerizing."
4241,pompeii-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,8,"When you plunk down your $12, you will get the destruction you were promised. But it's too bad it's such a repetitive, unengaging, glaringly digital experience and worse than that, you'll have to sit through the disaster that is the rest of movie."
4242,sorry-to-bother-you-movie,Barry Hertz,88,"The no-contest wildest comedy of the season, will keep your mind busy for weeks. "
4243,the-best-man-holiday-movie,Chris Cabin,12,"The sexism isn't quite as noxious as one might find in Tyler Perry's films, but that's as far as the compliments go when it comes to this overextended and deeply crude sermon."
4244,diana-vreeland-the-eye-has-to-travel-movie,Jay Weissberg,70,"When discussing tastemakers of the 20th century, few names conjure ""style"" with the zest of Diana Vreeland, and documentary The Eye Has to Travel gets the zing just right. "
4245,anaconda-movie,G. Allen Johnson,0,"If only director Luis Llosa and his cast could see the joke and seize upon it; instead, like its computer-morphed snake, the film doesn't have a clever bone in its body."
4246,the-warrior-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"The Warrior may be mighty of sword but he is exceedingly limp of writing. We never learn why he went bad in the first place, or what causes his sudden conversion. If the audience is expected to do most of the work, we should be paid $10.50 each."
4247,song-to-song-movie,Rex Reed,0,"I call it cinematic freebasing. It’s tired, repetitious, superficial, dreary and done to death before, by the same director, movie to movie and—forgive me for the unpardonable pun — song by song. "
4248,smurfs-the-lost-village-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,"Smurfs: The Lost Village has the look of a film that was rushed, and made on a tight budget. At best, it’s an adequate cinematic babysitter. "
4249,the-hunted-movie,Charles Taylor,10,It's an A-list movie for the most brain-dead elements of the action-movie crowd. 
4250,smurfs-the-lost-village-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"A strictly-for-the-kiddies animated reboot of the seemingly ancient Smurf brand, The Lost Village is so tame it hardly merits a PG rating."
4251,independence-day-resurgence-movie,David Ehrlich,16,An immaculate case-study in how far blockbusters have fallen. 
4252,reindeer-games-movie,Diana Abu-Jaber,8,"While you may like comedies and you make like thrillers, this film does neither of the above with any pizazz."
4253,la-mujer-de-mi-hermano-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"Most of the movie's plot becomes obvious before you even meet the brother, 10 minutes into it. Even the sex scenes turn out to be tasteful and tame. You've seen hotter stuff on Oxygen."
4254,startupcom-movie,Amy Taubin,80,"Has all the hallmarks of a Pennebaker production. The editing is seamless, the drama builds throughout, and the arc of the central character is as shapely as in a Hollywood fiction."
4255,the-promise-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"Pretty much a mess of a movie; the acting is overwrought, the plot is too tangled to play like anything BUT a plot, and although I know you can create terrific special effects at home in the basement on your computer, the CGI work in this movie looks like it was done with a dial-up connection."
4256,the-informers-movie,Peter Travers,0,One of the worst movies of this or any year.
4257,mothers-day-2016-movie,Jesse Hassenger,16,"Aniston is bad here, but she’s not alone. Marshall allows everyone in the movie to either play to their worst instincts or avert their eyes while skipping through the wreckage."
4258,the-worlds-fastest-indian-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,67,"The cockeyed devotion with which writer-director Roger Donaldson dramatizes the story of New Zealand motorcycle legend Burt Munro and his classic 1920 bike in The World's Fastest Indian is in direct proportion to the cockeyed devotion with which Munro himself pursued his lifetime goal of setting a land-speed record at Bonneville Flats, Utah."
4259,nine-12-weeks-movie,Michael Blowen,88,"This rather simple story, played with stunning conviction by Rourke and Basinger, achieves its apex through director Adrian Lyne's steamy direction. Yet, it's not nasty enough. [14 Mar 1986,  p.11]"
4260,chapter-27-movie,Glenn Kenny,0,"Visually ugly, morally non-existent and a complete black hole in the departments of insight and wit, Chapter 27 is quite possibly the most godawful, irredeemable film to yet emerge in the 21st century."
4261,corpse-bride-movie,Tasha Robinson,90,"Like all Burton's best work, it takes place in a distorted, vividly colored, meticulously crafted world where whimsy and gleeful ghoulishness mix freely."
4262,winged-migration-movie,Richard Schickel,90,Intellectually austere but technologically and aesthetically riveting documentary. 
4263,the-story-of-the-weeping-camel-movie,Noel Murray,80,"The family's few lines of dialogue are so integral to advancing the story that they may well have been scripted, but it's not that important whether The Story Of The Weeping Camel is more fiction than objective ethnography. If anything, the contrast between what's real and what may have been faked only adds to the tension between the natural world and encroaching modernism."
4264,a-most-wanted-man-movie,Alonso Duralde,80,"Hoffman doesn't get a lot of flashy, awards-show-clip moments, but he's all the more engrossing for underplaying and revealing volumes with the slightest of reactions and inflections."
4265,tyler-perrys-temptation-movie,Zachary Wigon,30,Temptation’s refusal to find nuance in its didactic worldview ensures that the film will ultimately only succeed for audiences already in agreement with it.
4266,animal-kingdom-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"Don't be fooled: In this unpeaceable kingdom, the den mama is also ready to eat her young. "
4267,the-adventures-of-rocky-bullwinkle-movie,J. Rentilly,0,"Rocky & Bullwinkle is the new millennium's ""Howard the Duck."""
4268,father-of-the-bride-part-ii-movie,Hal Hinson,10,"Father of the Bride, Part II is a virtual avalanche of cheap emotion. Short on comedy but long on maudlin sentiment, this sequel stumps so hard for the traditional values of home, hearth and family that any possible entertainment value is canceled out."
4269,death-of-a-nation-movie,Roger Moore,25,"Throughout Death of a Nation, which has the usual attacks on Clintons and George Soros and the third act “patriotic performances by D’Souza approved singers, even an African American choir, the man finds himself coddling Nazis."
4270,a-prayer-before-dawn-movie,Chuck Wilson,90,"A Prayer Before Dawn feels scarily authentic, and may be too much for some. But there are moments of grace amid the setting’s despair."
4271,youth-without-youth-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,0,"It's merely nutty, a picture that appears to have been made by an individual who has fallen off the edge of reason. Watching it was misery."
4272,dark-horse-2016-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,75,"Americans seem uncommonly uncomfortable discussing our own class struggles. But, boy, do we love to watch the Brits do it. I think that's one reason the inspiring and joyful Dark Horse is such an appealing film."
4273,three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-movie,Ann Hornaday,75,"His (Martin McDonagh) movie fuses naturalism and hysterically pitched theatricality with sometimes uneasy, but bracing results."
4274,a-dogs-purpose-movie,Ariel Scotti,80,"The film is both heartwarming and soul-shattering. Its theme of an unbreakable bond between man and his best friend is reminiscent of ""My Dog Skip,"" ""Homeward Bound"" and ""Old Yeller."""
4275,scouts-vs-zombies-movie,John DeFore,10,"A disregard for the rules established by George Romero (or the alternatives imagined by Danny Boyle) is far from the only problem with Christopher Landon's film, which does prove one thing fairly handily: Even beings deprived of the intellect and spirit granted to living humans can team up to produce a major studio motion picture."
4276,people-like-us-movie,Liam Lacey,0,"This is the sort of movie that ends up awash in sincere revelations, and not a moment of it feels remotely believable."
4277,men-in-black-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"When the plot finally does click in, it slows down the trajectory a little, but not fatally."
4278,jersey-boys-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,"Jersey Boys tells a familiar story, yes — but rarely told this well and with this much heart and soul."
4279,the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-movie,Carrie Rickey,12,Six guys and a gal who flatline on arrival. Easily the lamest action-adventure fantasy since “Wild Wild West.”
4280,peggy-sue-got-married-movie,Dave Kehr,100,"Droll, pungent, and superbly told, Peggy Sue Got Married is more thana return to form for Francis Coppola.  It's a film that reveals a new depth, anew sensitivity and a new sureness of technique for the 47-year-old director,a film that marks Coppola's entry into a rich, mature period."
4281,the-roommate-movie,Peter Travers,12,"Sucks bad, real bad."
4282,hugo-cabret-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Scorsese builds Hugo in the Méliès manner, creating a complete, ravishing Parisian world on a soundstage in England and reveling in the sheer transporting joy of it. Hugo will take your breath away."
4283,the-hunting-ground-movie,Inkoo Kang,85,"A timely, thorough and truly inspiring documentary about the financial and marketing imperatives that lead academic institutions to deny their students safety and justice."
4284,father-of-the-year-movie,Blake Goble,16,"This film is all easy beats, predictive familiarities, and absolutely zero heart, soul, or silliness anywhere to be found."
4285,the-tillman-story-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,"Watching the film, emotions range from sadness, of course, to frustration to outright anger."
4286,va-savoir-who-knows-movie,Charles Taylor,90,"Never less than witty, charming, accomplished."
4287,sollers-point-movie,Nick Allen,38,"One can imagine that Sollers Point might be better if its focus expanded to the area's inhabitants, not just Keith."
4288,papa-hemingway-in-cuba-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"A remarkable treat. It contains information about the writer heretofore unknown, and though it’s a dramatic feature and not a documentary, it claims to tell the truth, without embellishment. Even better, it was written by someone who saw the events depicted firsthand."
4289,butter-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,33,"Self-righteous and smug in its use of heartland stereotypes, the movie backfires by assuming that its intended liberal audience is just as intolerant and condescending as the conservative opposition insists it is."
4290,straight-outta-compton-movie,Kevin C. Johnson,88,"Credit goes to smart casting of unknowns in the leads, who click uniformly; a packed script that manages not to feel overly long and social commentary that is timeless."
4291,the-dead-pool-movie,Peter Stack,38,"The Dead Pool isn't much of a movie. It certainly isn't as fun, nor as compelling as its predecessors, and now and then the forced plot gets so ridiculous that it is certain to try the patience of even the most die-hard viewers. [13 Jul 1988, p.E1]"
4292,pirate-radio-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"If you want to know years in advance what old-age nostalgia is going to look like for Baby Boomers, look no further than Pirate Radio, in which the sun always shines, the music is great and the sex is available, guilt-free and glorious."
4293,i-want-someone-to-eat-cheese-with-movie,G. Allen Johnson,25,"Garlin's directing has little pacing, and many of the borderline gags could have been salvaged with some sharper editing. And there's a shocking amount of jokes and situations that just don't work."
4294,untitled-taken-sequel-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"When Neeson engages in bare-knuckle fisticuffs at the climax of the cartoonish Taken 2, I honestly couldn't figure out if the 60-year-old actor was actually present at all except for the close-ups."
4295,early-man-movie,Anthony Lane,70,"The stage of Early Man, though, is stuffed with men and women — on the Neanderthal spectrum, it’s true, but propelled by needs and greeds much like our own — whereas the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air are reduced to the role of extras. It pains me to say so, but Hognob is not enough."
4296,kill-bill-vol-2-movie,Charles Taylor,80,"There's no doubt that Kill Bill is an epic, and no doubt of the skill that's often apparent. But what it leaves us with is awesomely trivial. "
4297,freddy-got-fingered-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"In a sense, this is a horror film, worse than anything Andy Kaufman could dream up, in which Green tries to outgross himself."
4298,christine-movie,Matt Brennan,25,"It largely fails to animate Christine Chubbuck's inner turmoil, focusing instead on broad, blunt externalities."
4299,two-days-one-night-movie,Ed Gonzalez,75,"The Dardennes believe in human value and social order being rooted in a sense of solidarity, a staggering consciousness of community that brims with a sensitivity to place, movement, and emotion."
4300,hereafter-movie,J. Hoberman,30,"Hereafter is not just a stretch for Eastwood, it's a contortion. The irrationality of the premise is exceeded only by the strategic irrationalities of the plot."
4301,i-love-you-to-death-movie,Peter Travers,38,Kasdan has inexplicably reduced flesh-and-blood characters to cartoons.
4302,the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-the-beginning-movie,Peter Travers,0,"Putridly written, directed and acted."
4303,dark-crimes-movie,Johnny Oleksinski,0,That this exercise in vulgarity was made at all is shameful. Dark Crimes is punishing to watch.
4304,the-last-airbender-movie,Steve Persall,0,The Last Airbender makes the cartoon version with its ratchet-jawed characters and clunky animation seem like a Pixar classic.
4305,the-time-machine-movie,Michael Sragow,38,The movie gives us a time machine that resembles a twin-engined Mixmaster and a script that was tossed together inside one.
4306,valentin-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,One of the many stylistic distinctions of this outwardly modest production is the complex voice that the filmmaker has found for his young hero.
4307,the-kid-movie,Jessica Winter,10,"The Kid's denouement resembles the nightmare that would have transpired had execs foisted a toupee and a happy ending on ""12 Monkeys."""
4308,sleepwalk-with-me-movie,Amy Biancolli,75,"It all adds up to a fine, funny exercise in disheveled self-deprecation: a self-portrait of a guy who can't control a major portion of his life. Which, when you get right down to it, could describe almost any of us."
4309,one-true-thing-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,67,"In the end, One True Thing suggests, families can be healed even in loss. This may not be a true thing, but at least this emotional drama offers up hope, sweet like one of Kate Gulden's tasty cakes."
4310,poetry-movie,Carmen Gray,80,"Devoid of the ultra-violence so often associated with Korean cinema, Poetry is quiet and unhurried, making its portrait of social bleakness all the more impactful."
4311,postcards-from-the-edge-movie,Vincent Canby,80,"Postcards From the Edge seems to have been a terrifically genial collaboration between the writer and the director, Miss Fisher's tale of odd-ball woe being perfect material for Mr. Nichols's particular ability to discover the humane sensibility within the absurd."
4312,paranormal-activity-movie,Dennis Harvey,80,"Paranormal succeeds in staying unnervingly ""real."""
4313,im-not-there-movie,Steven Rea,88,"A loopy, surreal, beguiling collage of a film, the writer-director's meta-biopic embraces its subject."
4314,salvation-boulevard-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"The movie transforms a dim idea - ""Elmer Gantry"" lite - into comedy that's dead in the water and as dull as it is broad."
4315,always-woodstock-movie,Sheri Linden,30,"With its faux small-town values, faux countercultural ethos and faux personal struggles, Rita Merson’s debut feature skews closer to delusion than honesty."
4316,the-sum-of-all-fears-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,A middlebrow hybrid that should satisfy most fans of spy movies without blowing them away.
4317,hoop-dreams-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"By focusing on the personal side of the city game, Hoop Dreams tells us more about what works and what doesn't in our society than the proverbial shelf of sociological studies. And it is thoroughly entertaining in the bargain."
4318,the-tree-of-life-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Glibly put, this challenging time-skipping rumination is the big screen equivalent of watching that ""Tree"" grow."
4319,a-girl-like-her-movie,Thomas Lee,25,"For all its hidden-camera footage and teary confessions, the movie rings as true as an episode of MTV’s “Real World.”"
4320,captain-america-the-winter-soldier-movie,Eric Henderson,38,"Despite one or two moments of Venture Brothers-worthy fancy, the film is as by-the-numbers as any this series has ever offered. "
4321,loosies-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Romantic comedies are often as contrived and irritating as Loosies, but few feature a lead character so lacking in appeal."
4322,mad-dog-and-glory-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"Mad Dog and Glory turns out to be a light-spirited urban fairy tale. Despite occasional flashes of violence, its atmosphere is one of moonstruck romanticism."
4323,the-messenger-movie,Peter Debruge,80,"Nobody plays angry like Ben Foster, but compassion is something new for the actor, who softens his crazy-man shtick to deliver a complex and moving performance in The Messenger."
4324,its-kind-of-a-funny-story-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"The result is both a success and a disappointment. It's Kind of a Funny Story, divided into neat little daylong chapters in Craig's stay, lacks the staying power and bittersweet layering of ""Half Nelson"" and ""Sugar."""
4325,america-imagine-a-world-without-her-movie,David Ehrlich,0,"Graced with a hilariously definitive title, America is astonishingly facile, a film comprised entirely of straw man arguments. "
4326,1408-movie,Scott Bowles,75,"At his best, King's most effective creatures are not the ones behind creaking doors, but inside crooked minds."
4327,take-me-to-the-river-2015-movie,Rodrigo Perez,67,"Sure to baffle some, it’s a weird movie that isn’t actively weird, but what’s striking about the picture is Sobel’s point of view and confidence. While the movie is amorphous and porous, it’s clear this is exactly what the filmmaker is going for, and that’s certainly bold for a first timer."
4328,this-is-where-i-leave-you-movie,Roger Moore,63,"A big, broad dysfunctional family comedy, sort of a “Parenthood” pushed into R-rated “Adulthood” territory."
4329,don-jon-movie,Rodrigo Perez,83,"A beguiling romantic comedy with a heart, soul and pulse that will pleasure you for a full 90 minutes with hardly breaking a sweat."
4330,meeks-cutoff-movie,Rick Groen,88,"En route, what emerges is the kind of film, rich in paradox, that's common to Reichardt but so rare anywhere else – a film ponderously slow in pace yet kinetically charged with insight; starkly realistic yet allegorical too; psychologically astute yet politically resonant. "
4331,four-weddings-and-a-funeral-movie,Richard Corliss,70,A British romantic comedy with not much inside its pretty head but the spinning out of an ancient Hollywood riddle.
4332,the-hunted-movie,Steven Rea,75,"Isn't exactly fraught with psychological depth and nuance, but as a stalker-stalkee suspenser, the pic has some nice things going for it."
4333,now-you-see-me-2-movie,David Ehrlich,16,"We used to watch movies and wonder “How did they do that?” The problem with Now You See Me 2 isn’t that we already know the answer, it’s that we’re not even inspired to ask the question."
4334,final-destination-movie,Tom Cappello,0,"Inane, irresponsible, immature, poorly written."
4335,city-slickers-movie,Joe Pollack,63,"FOR ABOUT HALF its length, City Slickers is a close-to-perfect movie comedy...Crystal, Stern and Kirby are good comedians, but they fall apart when the script does. Only cinematographer Dean Semler (''Dances With Wolves'') has his vision, and the film looks great from start to finish. "
4336,the-boy-in-the-striped-pajamas-movie,Manohla Dargis,0,"See the Holocaust trivialized, glossed over, kitsched up, commercially exploited and hijacked for a tragedy about a Nazi family. Better yet and in all sincerity: don't."
4337,cop-out-movie,Nick Starkey,25,"When your movie is nothing more than a cheap and uninteresting homage, best not to call attention to that fact with a ten minute opening scene to that effect."
4338,hostiles-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"The movie, written for the screen and directed by Scott Cooper (who helmed Jeff Bridges’ Oscar-winning performance in ""Crazy Heart""), is careful not to demonize anyone and make the path to redemption both slow and methodical."
4339,welcome-to-the-rileys-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,12,"""Welcome to the Rileys""? Thanks, but no thanks. "
4340,freedomland-movie,Wesley Morris,38,An overblown urban crime drama that should be a lot better than it is.
4341,rudderless-movie,Keith Uhlich,20,"What really makes Rudderless a full-blown affront is a late-breaking narrative revelation (no spoilers here) that’s meant to add resonant emotional depth, but instead comes off as jaw-droppingly repugnant. That’s appropriate, though, for a movie with no sense of direction."
4342,envy-movie,Keith Phipps,10,"In short, every element suggests Envy ought to be amusing, but the only comparably disastrous movie in recent memory involves Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez, and a rapping retarded man."
4343,only-yesterday-1991-movie,Steven Rea,88,It's transformative.
4344,the-revolution-will-not-be-televised-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"A remarkable documentary by two Irish filmmakers that is playing in theaters on its way to HBO. It is remarkable because the filmmakers, Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain, had access to virtually everything that happened within the palace during the entire episode. "
4345,freedomland-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"The production can best be described by several f-words. It is frenetic, frazzled and febrile. It is also feeble -- almost touchingly so, if you think of what bottomless insecurity must have prompted so much bombast."
4346,mute-movie,Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,25,"Mute has gobs of style to burn, but it’s virtually the textbook definition of sound and fury signifying nothing."
4347,whipped-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,The trouble with Whipped isn't that its characters are dirty mouthed horndog jerks -- it's that they're phony dirty mouthed horndog jerks.
4348,the-beaver-movie,Mike Scott,75,"The Beaver also has a tendency to slip around as it finds its footing. But then the powerful third act comes and Foster, with Gibson's help, hits it home."
4349,author-the-jt-leroy-story-movie,Moira Macdonald,88,Feuerzeig lets us put together the puzzle pieces of Albert’s story. The film’s final five minutes — a punch to the heart — make it all clear.
4350,darkness-falls-movie,Kevin Thomas,10,"Darkness Falls -- with a thud. But it does not go gently into the night, for director Jonathan Liebesman and his large crew cram as much style and energy as they can into a hokey and morbid supernatural thriller plot. It's a downer to see so much effort expended on such junk."
4351,the-imitation-game-movie,Chris Nashawaty,83,The film is anchored by yet another hypnotically complex Cumberbatch performance. He's turning greatness into a habit.
4352,get-hard-movie,Drew Taylor,16,"It's an absolutely horrible, amateurishly assembled comedy that is more offensive than just about anything we've seen lately, a non-stop parade of racist, homophobic bile that would be bad enough from any comedian, but coming out of Ferrell and Hart has the effect of watching a childhood hero committing some horrible act."
4353,the-grand-budapest-hotel-movie,Marc Mohan,91,The Grand Budapest Hotel shows Anderson engaging with the world outside his meticulously composed frames like never before.
4354,pariah-movie,Wesley Morris,75,"This is a movie that feels in all its vividness, specificity, and honesty - and in its amateurish screenwriting, too - like something found from the early- to mid-1990s, when American independent moviemaking encouraged far more conversations about the sexuality of young, brown girls in movies like ""Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.'' and ""I Like It Like That.''"
4355,welcome-to-me-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,100,"This is a tragicomic fable about an all-too-real social predicament rather a wish-fulfillment fantasy, and the tragic result may be that hardly anyone notices how good it is, or the sickest, weirdest, most triumphant performance of Wiig’s career."
4356,about-adam-movie,Sean Axmaker,75,Surprisingly sweet and infectious.
4357,around-the-world-in-80-days-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,38,"Heaven knows what the suits at Disney were thinking, for what they ended up with was a bland Jackie Chan movie and a lifeless travelogue. "
4358,inescapable-movie,Rex Reed,75,"The remarkably expressive Mr. Siddig is sympathetic and true as the tortured father, communicating reams of emotion with his eyes, and Ms. Tomei is totally charismatic as his discarded lover who helps him out of a sense of humanity. "
4359,homicide-movie,Jay Carr,100,"At times Mantegna's character seems little more than his dilemma, but Mamet's stylized dialogue crackles urgently and colorfully, each word landing with a weight you find only in good writing. The dislocation accelerates compellingly into ironic absurdity as Mamet lets his cop swing in the wind in this mordant parable of wrong things done for right reasons. There have been a lot of cop movies, but never one like Homicide. It has a way all its own of raising your consciousness by whacking you in the head. [18 Oct 1991, p.33]"
4360,the-brothers-mcmullen-movie,Elvis Mitchell,90,"This modest, enormously likable film, about love and temptation and ties that bind, is about brotherhood most of all. [9 August 1995, p.C9]"
4361,seraphine-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"It ""explains"" nothing but feels everything. It reminds me of two other films: Bresson's ""Mouchette,"" about a poor girl victimized by a village, and Karen Gehre's ""Begging Naked,"" shown at Ebertfest this year, about a woman whose art is prized even as she lives in Central Park."
4362,inappropriate-comedy-movie,Neil Genzlinger,0,Sometimes a movie is so awful that the word awful is not up to the task of conveying its awfulness. The awful InAPPropriate Comedy is such a movie. It is memorably awful. It is stunningly awful. It is so awful that we are fortunate that “awful” has an adverbial use that means “very” or “extremely.” This movie is awfully awful.
4363,ballistic-ecks-vs-sever-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"You could run this film backward, soundtrack included, and it would make no less sense. --It's almost completely uninvolving, as well as being impenetrable."
4364,four-weddings-and-a-funeral-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,88,"It's a clever, multitiered affair built around the title rituals, frosted with delicious characterizations and tasty repartee. [11 March 1994, Life, p.4D]"
4365,blockers-movie,Peter Travers,75,"Don't get me wrong – the movie lays on the raunch, and there are more gut-busting laughs than you can count. But no one gets objectified or patronized."
4366,how-to-train-your-dragon-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,"Baruchel is outstanding, giving Hiccup just the right amount of confidence buried several layers beneath the shame he feels in not continuing the family business. Butler's a head-banger from way back, so he's convincing. And Ferrera gets the grrl-power vibe just right."
4367,the-beverly-hillbillies-movie,Roger Ebert,12,One of the worst movies of this or any year.
4368,crash-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Crash fools around with chronology in a Tarantinoesque way that brings its story full circle. You could argue that as events, and people, merge, Haggis' spiky screenplay (cowritten with Bobby Moresco) gets to be, quite simply, too much."
4369,the-sea-inside-movie,David Sterritt,75,Bardem is brilliant.
4370,batman-movie,Hal Hinson,100,"The movie fixes you in its gravitational pull. It's an enveloping, walk-in vision... As rich and satisfying a movie as you're likely to see all year."
4371,baby-geniuses-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,"A horrible, horrible film that wears out its welcome before its opening credits."
4372,the-cider-house-rules-movie,Jay Carr,88,"It's filled with vivid characters and action. Beneath its modesty of gesture, it's one of the year's richest, most humane films."
4373,eye-of-the-beholder-movie,Deborah Young,30,"A mixed-genre detective pic, thriller and love story that shifts gears too often and doesn't know when to end."
4374,the-warren-files-movie,Keith Phipps,70,"With The Conjuring, [Wan] once more turns the familiar terrifying, making it easy to fear what’s behind that closed door, or under the bed, or just around the corner, making a creaking noise that doesn’t sound quite right."
4375,romance-movie,Christopher Brandon,0,"The film so strongly fixates on strange, explicit sexual acts that it forgoes any emotional (i.e. romantic) aspects of sex."
4376,sleepover-movie,Connie Ogle,25,"The film is probably not evil incarnate, but it's so irritating you wish it -- and just about everyone in it -- would just shut up and get out of your room."
4377,major-payne-movie,Rick Gershman,25,"Major Payne is tasteless throughout and rarely funny. Mostly it's  embarrassing. And the profanities littered copiously through the film are an  upsetting clash with the level of humor, which seems directed to young teens. [24 March 1995, p.2B]"
4378,rocky-movie,Gene Siskel,75,"A great movie? Hardly. Stallone as the next Brando? You've got to be kidding. A nice little fantasy picture? Maybe. That's the hype and reality of Rocky, the flatout schmaltzy saga of a Philadelphia club boxer who, on New Year's Day of our Bicentennial Year, gets a chance to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world. . . ."
4379,the-taking-of-pelham-1-2-3-movie,Nathan Rabin,25,Tony Scott’s bracingly awful remake/desecration of the classic ‘70s thriller.
4380,the-german-doctor-movie,Bill Stamets,63,"Puenzo’s initial premise is more promising, though, than her sensational tone."
4381,jupiter-ascending-movie,Richard Roeper,0,There’s no defending Jupiter Ascending. There’s no explaining Jupiter Ascending. There’s no way Jupiter Ascending isn’t making an appearance on my list of the Worst Films of 2015.
4382,nutty-professor-ii-the-klumps-movie,David Sterritt,25,"The star's over-the-top energy isn't enough to make this hopelessly vulgar, numbingly repetitious farce worth watching."
4383,47-ronin-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"In the monumentally dull 47 Ronin, Reeves mumbles monosyllabic claptrap between dull action scenes. And it’s a shame: At almost 50 years old, the actor allows this turgid, clanky flick to play to his worst stereotypes."
4384,heaven-can-wait-movie,Roger Ebert,75,Somehow manages to combine the sweetness and innocence of the original with a satirical bite all its own.
4385,the-astronauts-wife-movie,Marc Savlov,30,The finished product is as predictably dull as a newborn's soft spot.
4386,charlie-st-cloud-movie,A.O. Scott,20,"You are not, in a movie like this, supposed to think too much; you are supposed to be transported beyond skepticism on a wave of pure, tacky feeling. Instead, in this case, you drown in sentimental, ghoulish nonsense."
4387,darkness-falls-movie,Scott Tobias,10,"Powered by dim bulbs on both sides of the camera, Darkness Falls barrels ahead with unrelenting stupidity, forsaking many of its own rules in search of the next cheap shock."
4388,untitled-judd-apatow-project-movie,Jesse Cataldo,38,"It certainly suffers from the staleness of its off-the-cuff, improv-inspired mode of comedy, which prizes free-form riffing over organically constructed comedic scenarios."
4389,winter-solstice-movie,Tasha Robinson,10,"The result is a numbing void, and a long, frustrating wait for something to happen."
4390,the-hottie-the-nottie-movie,Connie Ogle,0,The most astounding thing about this abysmal comedy -- aside from the fact the studio actually allowed critics within a mile of it -- is that it's so ghastly it is beneath even the meager dignity of Paris Hilton.
4391,the-brass-teapot-movie,Roger Moore,63,"The Brass Teapot stumbles into tedium, a parable that never quite resolves itself into the moral lesson it so desperately wants to convey."
4392,stardust-movie,Wesley Morris,38,Stardust certainly could have gone somewhere fun. But the magic and zip you need to get a blimp like this off the ground is scarce.
4393,youve-got-mail-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,"Takes almost two self-infatuated, smarmy, condescending, cringe-inducingly sentimental hours to reach its pre-ordained conclusion."
4394,sorority-boys-movie,David Ehrenstein,10,"Not only unfunny, but downright repellent."
4395,lethal-weapon-4-movie,Stephen Thompson,10,It's a dead end to a franchise that should have been put to rest two movies ago. 
4396,dont-be-afraid-of-the-dark-movie,Matthew Hays,75,"This is still a seriously entertaining horror movie, one that will please newcomers as well as fans of the original oddity. But by the end of the film, I was wishing the filmmakers had left us wondering about precisely who and what these critters were just a little bit longer. "
4397,big-mommas-house-movie,Jonathan Foreman,38,"Intermittently funny, often vulgar."
4398,robin-hood-prince-of-thieves-movie,Marah Eakin,30,"Black powder and Christian Slater are cool and all, but real dramatic successes come when a film has both heart and a slate of talented actors who aren’t just leaning on their oversized patchwork capes to tell the story."
4399,whiplash-movie,Mike Scott,100,"Whiplash is, at its core, about jazz -- that smoothest, mellowest of American art forms. But don't let that fool you. Writer-director Damien Chazelle's impressive sophomore effort is about as rock 'n' roll as a movie about jazz can possibly be."
4400,teen-titans-go!-to-the-movies-movie,Brian Tallerico,75,"It’s an infectiously goofy film, but also deceptively smart about why we love comic book heroes and the amount of stupidity we’re willing to accept within the genre."
4401,thats-my-boy-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,12,That's My Boy is radical only in its extreme laziness. 
4402,far-and-away-movie,Hal Hinson,10,"Far and Away is such a doddering, bloated bit of corn, and its characters and situations so obviously hackneyed, that we can't give in to the story and allow ourselves to be swept away."
4403,predestination-movie,Mike McCahill,80,"Considering these characters are bounced round like pinballs, it’s amazing Hawke and the hitherto unknown Snook gain the emotional traction they do: even those struggling to keep up can’t fail to notice how these two are burnt, figuratively and literally, by their experiences. "
4404,the-dukes-of-hazzard-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"A lame-brained, outdated wheeze about a couple of good ol' boys who roar around the back roads of the South in the General Lee, their beloved 1969 Dodge Charger."
4405,the-purge-election-year-movie,Simon Abrams,25,"There's nothing specific, thoughtful or emotionally involving about Election Night beyond a basic need to push buttons, and get a rise out of viewers. The good guys are actually bad, and the bad guys are too indistinct to be hateful. Vote with your wallets, and go see something else."
4406,dead-man-down-movie,Nathan Rabin,33,"Dead Man Down exerts an unconscionable level of effort for minimal reward: It aspires to exquisite world-weariness, but just ends up feeling exhausted by its frenzied yet fruitless exertions."
4407,enemy-movie,Peter Debruge,70,"Ultimately, the enigmatic surface conflict — in which a man must contend with his own carbon copy as rival — proves to be the film’s own worst enemy, for its dark, David Lynchian allure proves almost too compelling, obscuring the material’s deeper themes."
4408,the-secret-in-their-eyes-movie,Steve Persall,100,"The movie grabbed me and wouldn't let go during a bravura set piece at a soccer game when Campanella's camera glides into the stadium, finds Benjamin's face in the crowd and doesn't stop moving (with only a couple of edits) for six breathtaking minutes."
4409,the-tuxedo-movie,Ray Conlogue,25,"It's a comic-book idea that might have been fun. But it's beyond the reach of first-time feature director Kevin Donovan, who squanders his main asset, Jackie Chan, and fumbles the vital action sequences."
4410,dead-man-down-movie,Peter Bradshaw,20,"Director Niels Arden Orpev was in charge of the original ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" starring Rapace, but fails to create a revenge thriller with anything like the same focus."
4411,charlies-angels-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"It's a movie without a brain. Charlie's Angels is like the trailer for a video game movie, lacking only the video game, and the movie."
4412,the-clapper-movie,Gary Goldstein,10,"Writer-director Dito Montiel, adapting his novel, takes an ill-conceived premise and drives it into the ground with a painful, tone-deaf approach to both social satire and romantic comedy."
4413,three-movie,Roger Ebert,63,The most that can be said for the characters here is they all seem mighty pleased.
4414,the-bourne-supremacy-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,Close to perfect example of an expertly designed and executed thriller. 
4415,bird-people-movie,Robert Abele,90,"Ferran's eccentricity is an acquired taste, but the light, emotional artfulness of Bird People — a cry for the senses in a world that so often dulls — is welcome."
4416,de-lovely-movie,Peter Travers,75,"At its best, De-Lovely evokes a time, a place and a sound with stylish wit and sophistication. "
4417,hot-pursuit-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"Hot Pursuit gets cold quickly. That’s certainly not the fault of stars Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara, who work to keep this blessedly brief action-comedy shaking and cruising to an unthrilling end. The blame lies with a dopey script, director Anne Fletcher and a lazy Hollywood assumption that female buddy flicks should be as half-assed as their male counterparts."
4418,mr-deeds-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,The remake stumbles from a ragged start into a child's garden of worses -- worse than the original in more ways than you could imagine.
4419,to-be-or-not-to-be-1983-movie,Liam Lacey,88,"Though Brooks is tasteless as usual in To Be Or Not To Be, his remake of Ernest Lubitsch's 1942 comedy of the same name may be his best work since his debut film, The Producers. [19 Dec 1983]"
4420,avenue-montaigne-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,67,"For Yank color in her soap-bubbly movie, director Daniele Thompson has her pal Sydney Pollack appear as...a famous director."
4421,blade-runner-2049-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"As a contrast to Gosling's deliberately deadened, emotionally zoned-out turn, Ford almost single-handedly amps up a film otherwise intentionally drained of character vitality."
4422,please-give-movie,Rex Reed,25,"At a time when every penny counts, where do they come up with the money to finance a movie this boring?"
4423,lie-movie,Steven Rea,75,A disturbing and provocative study of adolescence and isolation.
4424,dark-blue-world-movie,Derek Elley,80,"Sverak's sheer technical finesse, and ability to spin on a dime between comedy and tragedy, the personal and the historical, makes Dark Blue World succeed where other similarly themed movies, from ""Battle of Britain"" to ""The Blue Max,"" seem heavy-handed by comparison."
4425,new-best-friend-movie,Scott Tobias,10,"A lurid, unsavory mix of Reefer Madness hysteria, drive-in sleaze, and the queasy morality of '80s slasher film."
4426,silence-movie,Richard Roeper,100,What beauty. What brutality. What madness.
4427,battle-of-the-year-movie,Simon Abrams,12,"To put in Clichénese, the only language Battle of the Year knows: the creator's hearts just weren't in this thing. "
4428,birdman-or-the-unexpected-virtue-of-ignorance-movie,Scott Tobias,30,"Alejandro González Iñárritu is a pretentious fraud, but it’s taken some time to understand the precise nature of his fraudulence."
4429,the-pledge-movie,Ken Fox,70,"Short on action but heavy on ambiance, and the cumulative effect packs a whopper if you're willing to stop and think about it. Penn, never one to opt for action over thought, clearly expects that his audience will."
4430,guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-movie,Alonso Duralde,75,"There is wit and there are explosions, and while none of them represent a step above “Guardians of the Galaxy,” neither do they impugn the memory of one of the freshest and most fun of the Marvel movies."
4431,splice-movie,Steve Persall,91,It's a refreshing change from run-of-the-kill horror. Nothing in Splice feels done merely for the moment -- it's to creep you out later.
4432,beautiful-creatures-2012-movie,Lawrence Toppman,63,"Whether or not you think of this as a knockoff, it has a ripeness “Twilight” never did."
4433,death-race-2000-movie,Roger Ebert,0,I was torn between walking out immediately and staying to witness a spectacle more dismaying than anything on the screen: the way small children were digging gratuitous bloodshed.
4434,broken-embraces-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"Many of the characters go by two different names. So best advice for optimum viewing is, see Broken Embraces...twice."
4435,hot-tub-time-machine-2-movie,John DeFore,10,A flop-sweaty cash grab that gives a bad name to sequels in which key talent has jumped ship... Viewers who expected nothing from the first but were pleasantly surprised will get burned badly here.
4436,blindspotting-movie,Richard Whittaker,100,"Funny, vibrant, insightful, tragic, achingly timely, and yet with an underlying message about empathy that is timeless, Blindspotting may be the summer's most essential movie. "
4437,together-2001-movie,Jay Carr,75,"The best thing about Together, apart from the way some of its characters grow on you even as others put you off, is the way it snatches idealism back from the brink of life-smothering orthodoxy."
4438,hidden-figures-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"This bracing movie...gets off to a spirited start and rarely lets up, sharing with viewers a little-known chapter of history as inspiring as it is intriguing."
4439,the-human-race-movie,Gabe Toro,0,"This is a laughably bad movie, but an amazing drinking game waiting to happen."
4440,the-dressmaker-movie,Kyle Smith,0,"""The Titanic"" is now the second-biggest disaster Kate Winslet has ever been associated with. Her new one, The Dressmaker, is like some hellborn alloy of film noir, campy melodrama, “High Plains Drifter” and the Darwin Awards for people who die in moronic accidents."
4441,girls-trip-movie,Gary Thompson,75,"It’s possible, even given Lee’s jaunty structure, that he could have given Girls Trip a more disciplined edit — the movie runs more than two hours, devotes generous time to less interesting characters, and makes room for the movie’s long roster of performance cameos — in addition to Hart, there’s P. Diddy, Common, Ne-Yo, Mariah Carey, Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, and many others."
4442,olympus-has-fallen-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Olympus Has Fallen is no fun at all. To the contrary, it soon grows tedious, odious and oppressive. "
4443,smurfs-the-lost-village-movie,Alonso Duralde,70,"Lots of little lessons are interspersed throughout Smurfs: The Lost Village, but the film itself is an example that even the big, powerful, well-paid grown-ups who run movie studios can learn a thing or two."
4444,adam-movie,Kimberley Jones,30,"This is the kind of movie in which every other line of dialogue feels like a metaphor – and from there on, the film seesaws between the uncomfortable extremes of glum and twee: an overwrought dirge keyed to a xylophonic ping."
4445,eragon-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,30,"In a time of darkness, under the evil reign of John Malkovich -- who sits upon a throne in a different sound stage from the rest of the cast -- a hero shall rise. But lo, there will be little rejoicing, for this dragon rider (newcomer Edward Speleers) is but a nancy boy, about as imposing as Lance Bass, and somehow in possession of the only soap and clean clothes in all the land."
4446,gloria-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"A classic like this deserves to be unearthed! After all, this picture is likely to command a pedestal of its own at the local video store. Just check for shelves marked either ""Sharon Stone"" or ""Staff's Worst Picks of 1999."""
4447,tyler-perrys-a-madea-christmas-movie,Richard Corliss,10,This eighth Madea movie is pretty lame even by Perry’s slapdash standards.
4448,the-cobbler-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,A painfully earnest and totally unfunny magic-realist fable set on the Lower East Side that works in no way whatsoever.
4449,i-am-love-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"An amazing film. It is deep, rich, human. It is not about rich and poor, but about old and new. It is about the ancient war between tradition and feeling."
4450,whipped-movie,Nick Rutigliano,10,"If all-out headache-nausea-braindeath is what you crave, Whipped's available."
4451,paranoia-movie,Nick Schager,20,"The fact that Hemsworth is severely lacking in leading-man charisma also doesn’t help the pervasive overall incompetence of the film, which fixates on the perils and panic of our modern surveillance culture while itself proving to be borderline unwatchable."
4452,fair-game-movie,Jay Carr,12,"The buzz was that Fair Game reshot its ending. They should have reshot its painfully fabricated beginning and middle, too. [03 Nov 1995]"
4453,swat-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,Looks like the deformed spawn of a development process gone awry.

4455,garden-state-movie,Ella Taylor,70,"Braff is bright and has a quick ear for vernacular dialogue, and he's caught the look and the sound of his blitzed, prematurely disillusioned generation, which has had to live with more lack of definition than most. "
4456,tag-movie,Glenn Kenny,38,"It’s a lazy, vulgar celebration of White Male American Dumbness—one that only put an African American in the cast to camouflage just how much of a celebration of White Male American Dumbness it is. "
4457,haywire-movie,Justin Chang,80,"Paring down narrative and character concerns in favor of a breathtaking application of pure thriller technique, Soderbergh's latest picture is a lean, efficient exercise tossed off with his customary sangfroid and wickedly dry sense of humor."
4458,bride-wars-movie,Claudia Puig,25,Bride Wars is about as funny as a cringingly awkward wedding toast.
4459,platoon-movie,Pat Graham,70,"He makes a good job of it, though the wider aspirations to contemporary relevance seem dubious. Stone seeks large lessons in the experiences of ordinary men in battle, but it isn't clear Vietnam has anything new to offer: war is hell and somebody inevitably gets shafted, but the uniqueness of this conflict lies away from the military arena: in politics, psychology, and history. For all the purported naturalism, the film seems resolutely schematic, and the attitudes shaping the drama are far from open-ended. "

4461,mission-impossible-iii-movie,Steve Persall,75,"The IMF workings are still complex, but without Brian DePalma's artistic indulgences (Part 1) and John Woo's poetic distractions (Part 2).

4466,leave-no-trace-movie,Chuck Bowen,88,"In Leave No Trace, director Debra Granik continues to refine a style of tranquil intensity. The film's images have a rapt and pared-down power, with emphases that are never quite where you expect them to be."
4467,stealing-beauty-movie,Peter Travers,75,"In contrasting the sexuality and rebellion of Lucy's generation with his own, Bertolucci clearly yearns to rekindle his creative spirit."
4468,lost-in-la-mancha-movie,David Sterritt,100,This is a sad and funny true-life tale that speaks volumes about the difficulties of independent filmmaking.
4469,beautiful-movie,Sara Wildberger,25,"The trouble starts with the script, and it doesn't end there."
4470,the-other-boleyn-girl-movie,Marc Savlov,67,"Works both as an engagingly sordid meditation on protofeminism and contemporized sisterhood set in a time and a place where either/or were grounds for, at the very least, defenestration."

4474,goodbye-to-language-3d-movie,Oliver Lyttelton,75,"Godard's full length take on 3D is bold, brilliant and exactly what the format needed — a iconoclast taking it and making his own, and almost every time he frames a shot in three dimensions, from opening credits to the final moments, there's something attention-grabbing going on."

4479,rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,"“Star Wars” movies have been dazzling, infuriating, heartbreaking, silly, witty, convoluted, gripping and overblown. But until Rogue One: A Star Wars story, I don’t think “dull” was the most appropriate adjective."
4480,battleship-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"Battleship is a board game for children, so it stands to reason a film adaptation would also be aimed at kids. But did they have to gear it to really dumb kids?"
4481,bronson-movie,Peter Travers,75,This movie and Hardy's electrifying performance will knock you for a loop.
4482,hell-or-high-water-movie,Peter Rainer,91,"A lean, efficient modern Western that is so satisfyingly constructed I’m tempted to say it’s just about perfect. There’s a special pleasure in watching a movie that knows exactly what it’s after and then, in scene after scene, gets it."
4483,jack-ryan-shadow-recruit-movie,Kimberley Jones,20,"Branagh might as well have opened a can and dumped it on a plate, the ridges of a factory-line production still perfectly hatched on a gelatinous cylinder of crud."

4494,american-reunion-movie,M. E. Russell,8,"Scenes will wander from gross-out gag to sentimental schmaltz to pervy leer to cheap nostalgia within a 30-second span, utterly free of clear directorial guidance. Even worse, very little of it is remotely funny."
4495,rollerball-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"It has no moments of athletic grace amid the chaos, no apparent sense of strategy. It's basically just mayhem set to rock music."
4496,the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,You don’t often hear the adjective “uncomfortable” used as a compliment. But you’re seldom going to come across a movie that makes you as uncomfortable as The Diary of a Teenage Girl yet seems as true to life.

4502,grumpier-old-men-movie,Walter Addiego,12,"Grumpier Old Men certainly isn't relying on its mawkish and hokey story to put warm bodies in the seats. There's no reason to see the picture - a sequel to their 1993 hit, “Grumpy Old Men"" - other than to relish the talents of these two veterans, plus Sophia Loren, a newcomer to the series."
4503,the-gallows-movie,Drew McWeeny,0,"It is a singularly unpleasant experience, not because it is scary or extreme or even interesting. It is unpleasant because it is a dull story filled with characters that are so poorly drawn as to be forgettable even while you're watching them."

4505,death-wish-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,38,"The new Death Wish is a vigilante film that's also about vigilante film cliches, when it remembers to think about such things, which is only occasionally. Most of its attempts to subvert or freshen up familiar elements aren't well developed, and they're certainly never strong enough to counter the bloodlust and gun worship that's invariably going to power this kind of project."

4509,kicking-screaming-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Not only not funny, it's unfunny. It kills humor. Sit in a room by yourself, look at a blank screen for 90 minutes, and you'll have more of a chance of laughing at your own thoughts than you will at this movie."
4510,2-days-in-new-york-movie,Rick Groen,25,"2 Days in New York plays like 2 years in Attica. You don't watch this movie so much as serve it out, a light comedy doled out as a heavy sentence."

4516,sirens-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,"Sirens is a brazen, luscious Australian sex comedy full of nature and nudity, flesh, food and fantasy. With its theme of erotic awakening on a painter's sunny Blue Mountains estate, and its frequent scenes of lush female models scampering around naked, it's often a pretty silly film. But it's also an immensely enjoyable one: a fairy tale in which everything-fashions, scenery, badinage, music, even moments of angst-becomes a kind of goofy aphrodisiac. [11 March 1994, p.C2]"
4517,open-water-movie,Andrea Gronvall,80,Superlative chiller. 
4518,rebel-without-a-cause-movie,David Parkinson,100,"The red-jacketed, Method-pouting James Dean steals every scene, but the ensemble playing is nothing short of exemplary."

4521,the-italian-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"It's a carefully and almost classically balanced combination of ingredients, blending dirty-faced realism (so much more damning because it judges and condemns no one) with mystical fable of quest and homecoming."
4522,the-school-of-rock-movie,David Ansen,100,"It's a bravura, all-stops-out, inexhaustibly inventive performance. I don't know how much was improvised, and how much comes from White's sharp screenplay, but Black may never again get a part that displays his mad-dog comic ferocity to such brilliant effect. He, and the movie, kick ass."
4523,big-fat-liar-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,"Loud and unfunny, this cheesy-looking farce is mostly an excuse for a series of plugs."
4524,9-songs-movie,Neva Chonin,25,"This disappointing new film from director Michael Winterbottom (""24 Hour Party People"") suffers from a similar malaise: It's poetic and pretty, strives for profundity without attaining it, and finally ends up saying nothing."
4525,repo!-the-genetic-opera-movie,John Anderson,20,"So over-the-top it's purple. At the same time, it's not too many lengths of intestine beyond some mainstream movies, ""Sweeney Todd"" being the most obvious comparison."
4526,twilight-zone-the-movie-movie,Michael Blowen,12,"The original tv series was sometimes frightening, sometimes enlightening, and sometimes a bit too allegorical, but it was almost always entertaining. Serling gave us more in 25 minutes than Spielberg & Co. give us in nearly two hours. [24 Jun 1983, p.1]"
4527,kadosh-movie,Sean Axmaker,83,"An alternately angry and sad portrait, passionate in its presentation and moving in its portrayal of individuals who sacrifice their love for the tenets of their religion."

4534,personal-shopper-movie,Richard Roeper,100,"It’s a brilliant character study, a devilishly confounding murder mystery, a legitimately haunting psychological thriller, a hell of a ghost story — and one of the most memorable viewing experiences I’ve had in the last few years."

4542,baby-geniuses-movie,Sandra Contreras,30,Formulaic and deeply unfunny.
4543,the-princess-and-the-frog-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"The Princess and the Frog invite viewers to see the world as a lively, mixed-up, even confounding place, to recognize essential parts of ourselves in what we see, and to say: This is what we look like."
4544,x-men-apocalypse-movie,Lawrence Toppman,63,"When we have to spend time with Beast and Angel and Nightcrawler and Cyclops and Psylocke and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence, still strong), the movie too often becomes a parade of cameos.

4547,midnight-run-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Whoever cast De Niro and Grodin must have had a sixth sense for the chemistry they would have; they work together so smoothly, and with such an evident sense of fun, that even their silences are intriguing."
4548,magic-mike-xxl-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"What saves it all from being sordid is the open desire of the director, Gregory Jacobs, and his writer, Reid Carolin, to make sure the women in the film, not the male dancers, are ultimately the ones who are celebrated."
4549,i-am-sam-movie,Charles Taylor,0,Penn's portrayal strikes me as equally insensitive. It's the nightmare performance of 2001.
4550,mike-boy-movie,Noel Murray,10,"None of this makes a lick of sense, but it’s fascinatingly asinine. It feels wrong to encourage this kind of misbegotten DIY project, but if you’re a fan of the likes of “The Room” or “Birdemic,” honestly, you can’t miss “Mike Boy.”"
4551,riddick-movie,Adam Nayman,75,"The quickest and easiest way to humanize an unlikeable movie character is to give him a lovable dog, and so it goes with Riddick."
4552,bruno-movie,Nathan Rabin,83,"Cohen no longer has freshness and novelty on his side, but he’s retained the power to shock, offend, provoke, unsettle, and most importantly, entertain a jaded, desensitized public."

4557,friend-request-movie,Josh Kupecki,11,"The whole thing reeks of a spooky Halloween episode of Law & Order that will have your parents shaking their heads in acknowledgment, and you dear reader, shaking your head in disbelief."
4558,mothers-day-2016-movie,Justin Chang,10,"From awkward start to merciful finish, Mother's Day is a grim, listless affair that may leave you pining for the relative pep and coherence of its predecessors (both of which were scripted by Katherine Fugate), or at least a few of their incidental pleasures. "
4559,diablo-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,25,"Directed to resemble rather than act, Eastwood comes across as stiff and unemotive, though Diablo doesn’t even have the sense to let its star get upstaged by the overqualified supporting cast."

4561,a-united-kingdom-movie,Sarah Kurchak,75,A United Kingdom hits all of the necessary emotional notes and political intrigue of a solid historical figure drama.
4562,the-purge-election-year-movie,John Semley,25,The problem with the Purge films is they feel like they’re made for people who would actually take part in the purge.
4563,now-you-see-me-2-movie,Owen Gleiberman,80,"Now You See Me 2 is more like a giddy piece of cheese from the ’80s, a chance to spend two more hours with characters we like, doing variations on the things that made us like them in the first place. The revisit, in this case, is well-earned."
4564,how-do-you-know-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"No need to belabor the awfulness of this film, a romantic comedy devoid of romance - instead of chemistry there's the flow of reverse magnetism - and lacking in comic timing, let alone comic content."
4565,rock-star-movie,Michael Sragow,38,"Rock Star neither touches a raw nerve nor garners any resonance as a period piece. You'd be better off renting ""This is Spinal Tap."""
4566,dogville-movie,Sean Axmaker,25,"But as an artist, von Trier's contempt for humanity is becoming harder to hide with stylistic flourish. He doesn't even try here, and his arrogance is topped only by his misanthropy."
4567,corpse-bride-movie,Wesley Morris,88,"Burton, who directed the film with animator Mike Johnson, has rarely been in brisker, friskier form."
4568,you-dont-mess-with-the-zohan-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,30,"In truth, there's not much point to reviewing Adam Sandler comedies. They're almost always widely panned, and yet still manage to earn well over $100 million domestically. Don’' Mess with the Zohan looks to continue both trends, even if exaggerated Yiddish accents and sex with the elderly only take one so far."
4569,despicable-me-3-movie,Soren Andersen,63,"It’s a standard kiddie cartoon: noisy, colorful and forgettable."
4570,che-part-two-movie,J. Hoberman,80,"Every Bolivian sequence has its Cuban parallel, which is why Che's two parts are best seen together. Guerrilla may be the more realized of the two--and could certainly stand on its own--but it is only comprehensible in the light of The Argentine. Elevating Guerrilla to tragedy, The Argentine puts some hope in hopelessness--and even in history."

4572,men-women-children-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"With Men, Women & Children and the equally laborious “Labor Day,” Reitman has gotten trapped amid the crumbling edifice of Hollywood. It’s turning him old before his time."

4574,london-movie,Phil Hall,0,London is the independent film world's equivalent of a fiasco.
4575,norm-of-the-north-movie,Glenn Kenny,10,"Its plotline, involving Norm’s trek to New York to foil a condos-in-the-Arctic scheme, is inane even by the standards of animated funny animal comedy. Its gag set pieces run the gamut from uninspired to incoherent."
4576,x-men-origins-wolverine-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"""Wolverine"" is silly and typical, not in spite of but because it bonds an undeveloped family feud onto the main character's renegade story."
4577,kingsman-the-golden-circle-movie,Richard Roeper,38,"If you liked the original, the best way to preserve that memory is to stay away from this sequel."
4578,24-hour-party-people-movie,Robert Wilonsky,90,"The film is a whirlwind blur, a kinetic thrill ride through the industrial backwater that was one of punk and post-punk's most fertile Promised Lands: Manchester."
4579,ps-movie,James Berardinelli,75,An intriguing and satisfying romance that may hold some appeal even for those who normally do not like films about affairs of the heart.

4581,hoodwinked-too!-hood-vs-evil-movie,Liam Lacey,25,It's outstandingly obnoxious.
4582,the-low-down-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"Gets better the more attention you pay. To say ""nothing happens"" is to be blind to everyday life, during which we wage titanic struggles with our programming."
4583,the-children-of-the-century-movie,Jack Mathews,63,"Inexplicable human bondage is a literary staple of film as well as literature, but Kurys (""Entre Nous""), usually so sure-handed with her actors, has trouble making this bond compelling."
4584,mifune-the-last-samurai-movie,James Greenberg,80,"The real accomplishment of Mifune: The Last Samurai, and perhaps of any successful documentary about cinema history, is that it makes you want to run out and see the movies all over again."
4585,the-girl-next-door-2004-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"This is a dishonest, quease-inducing ""comedy"" that had me feeling uneasy and then unclean. Who in the world read this script and thought it was acceptable?"
4586,my-favorite-martian-movie,Nathan Rabin,16,"With its mixture of whimsy and special-effects-driven humor, My Favorite Martian aims to blend E.T. and Men In Black, but in its sad, mercenary shamelessness, it ends up recalling Mac And Me instead."
4587,a-christmas-carol-movie,Roger Ebert,100,An exhilarating visual experience and proves for the third time he's (Zemeck) is one of the few directors who knows what he's doing with 3-D.
4588,excuse-me-for-living-movie,Simon Abrams,10,"No strand of Excuse Me for Living's frantic, unfunny, and pseudo-thoughtful narrative is well conceived."
4589,the-tuxedo-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"The result isn't merely ludicrous, it's something far worse. It's drab. It's uninteresting. It squanders Chan's uniqueness; it could even be said to squander Jennifer Love Hewitt!"

4593,death-race-2000-movie,Zack Handlen,91,"It’s all ridiculous and occasionally surreal, but Bartel never loses sight of the unpleasantness; when these cartoons explode, they don’t get to place any more orders with the Acme company. They just die."
4594,the-princess-of-france-movie,Eric Kohn,91,"While not aspiring to the heights of the texts underscoring his work, Piñero displays a daring formalism that transcends its many inspirations to find its own unique rhythms. "
4595,predators-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"It's solidly entertaining for what it is and, while it does little to truly rejuvenate the franchise, at least it lessens the pain caused by two gimmicky cross-over pictures that sucked too much juice out of what was one of the 1980s' most surprisingly tense sci-fi action pictures."
4596,the-stepford-wives-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"A pitiful shambles of a remake, The Stepford Wives might have qualified as a rethinking of the 1975 original if there were any trace of coherent thought in the finished product."
4597,buffalo-soldiers-movie,David Sterritt,75,At its best it's as refreshing as it is daring. Superbly acted.
4598,the-happening-movie,Nathan Rabin,33,"Shyamalan still has an abundance of personality and ambition, and there are scattered moments of craft throughout, but the gulf between his lofty aspirations and feeble accomplishments has seldom been wider or more chuckle-inducing."
4599,whale-rider-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"Caro gives the fablesque story -- based on a 1,000-year-old Maori legend -- both a contemporary and timeless quality, anchored by newcomer Castle-Hughes' powerful and haunting performance. "
4600,alpha-and-omega-movie,Scott Bowles,38,Alpha and Omega is one of those rarities in the modern era of Hollywood animation: bad.
4601,quills-movie,Stephen Hunter,90,"Profane, sacrilegious, pornographic, sadistic and Sade-istic, titillating and the most honorable movie of the year."
4602,masked-and-anonymous-movie,Keith Phipps,20,"Dylan's performance doesn't offer any clues. He's an icon and he delivers an icon's performance, literally: He could easily have been replaced by piece of wood with his face painted on it. That distance also means he remains more or less untouched by the embarrassment going on around him, even though it's largely his own creation. "
4603,skyfall-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Skyfall triumphantly reinvents 007 in one of the best Bonds ever. This is a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon, with Daniel Craig taking full possession of a role he previously played unconvincingly. I don't know what I expected in Bond No. 23, but certainly not an experience this invigorating."
4604,double-take-2001-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,38,"As buddy pics go, this is pretty much not even worth a single look, let alone a double take."
4605,die-hard-with-a-vengeance-movie,Desson Thomson,70,"Cutting to the chase: In terms of summer movie thrills, director John McTiernan's return to the ""Die Hard"" genre (he made the first one) is a triumph."
4606,detective-dee-and-the-mystery-of-the-phantom-flame-movie,Justin Chang,70,"An inventive marriage of ancient China and Agatha Christie, Detective Dee and the Mystery of Phantom Flame is a lavishly overwrought historical whodunit. "
4607,thomas-and-the-magic-railroad-movie,Shawn Levy,0,An ugly and insipid film.
4608,teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1990-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0," When a kids’ flick has nothing to offer but cute special effects, it’s easy to think the filmmakers are patting themselves on the backs for their technical ingenuity. That’s not comic fantasy — that’s marketing."
4609,repo-men-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Basically a soulless slasher flick, and one that demeans its gifted performers."
4610,do-you-trust-this-computer-movie,John DeFore,70,"Though it shows some strain in containing the topic's inherent sprawl, the doc is more thoughtful than some of its predecessors, and benefits from interviews with newsmakers like Elon Musk and, even better, Westworld co-creator Jonathan Nolan."
4611,now-in-the-wings-on-a-world-stage-movie,Stephanie Merry,88,"The film serves an effective marketing tool after all, with some lively footage and funny interviews. It’s just too bad viewers can’t see the actual play."
4612,cousin-jules-movie,Zachary Wigon,80,"Thoroughly transporting, the peacefulness and clarity of Cousin Jules can't help but reveal, by contrast, the restlessness and agitation too common to life today."
4613,ratatouille-movie,Michael Sragow,100,"Ratatouille is a sublime dish of a movie, and the company's piece de resistance."
4614,mrs-henderson-presents-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,One of the wittiest comedies to come our way in a very long time.
4615,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,A.A. Dowd ,83,"By the rousing final act, Johnson has brought an apocalyptic grandeur to the lightsaber duels and airborne combat. His often-stirring addition to the saga finally lands on an affecting point about the importance of preserving essential cultural tradition without clinging too strictly to the dogma—and the texts—of the old way."
4616,son-of-the-mask-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"At its least intolerable, the movie is a fatherhood freak-out."
4617,i-am-another-you-movie,Jared Mobarak,75,"Addiction, mental illness, and religion become more than just color — they become real motivating factors that cause us to reevaluate everything we thought we knew. What’s great about this transition is that Wang isn’t merely a guide leading us through. She’s experiencing this shift too."
4618,the-golden-bowl-movie,Jonathan Foreman,75,"But it is Thurman who stands out, with a marvelous, full-blooded performance, her best in some time, as tragic Charlotte."
4619,the-squid-and-the-whale-movie,Michael Sragow,91,"Bitterly funny about divorce, it's even sharper and more original about intellectuals and their discontent."
4620,after-dark-my-sweet-movie,Jay Scott,100,"This is a miniature classic, a pulp tragedy. [29 Sep 1990]"
4621,the-girl-who-played-with-fire-movie,Steven Rea,75,"This is no-nonsense, let's-get-to-it business, and will probably be less satisfying, and less clear, to viewers unfamiliar with the source material."
4622,fargo-movie,Arnold Wayne Jones,100,"Fargo is a concert performance--an illuminating amalgam of emotion and thought. It glimpses into the heart of man and unearths a blackly comic nature, hellishly mercurial and selfish, yet strangely innocent. If it weren't so funny, it would be unbearably disturbing."
4623,across-the-universe-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Here is a bold, beautiful, visually enchanting musical where we walk INTO the theater humming the songs."
4624,the-joy-luck-club-movie,Peter Travers,88,Hits hardest when it bypasses sentiment to ponder the inextricable mix of love and pain that comes with the ties that bind.
4625,russian-ark-movie,Marta Barber,88,"Even in its most tedious scenes, Russian Ark is mesmerizing. "
4626,taken-3-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"Even Liam Neeson seems bored by the imbecilic, repetitive “Taken 3,” an action movie no one was clamoring for and no one will enjoy."
4627,tropic-thunder-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,100,"It's raunchy, outspoken -- and also a smart and agile dissection of art, fame, and the chutzpah of big-budget productions."
4628,signs-wonders-movie,David Sterritt,75,Unusual and imaginative drama.
4629,merry-christmas-movie,Nathan Rabin,67,"Though a painless time-passer, Joyeux Noël ultimately contributes little to the venerable anti-war genre beyond its curious message that to some degree, war is hell because it prevents soldiers from making really neat friends and pen-pals from different counties."
4630,the-assassin-movie,Mark Jenkins,88,"This mesmerizingly beautiful drama ponders themes of duty, patience, isolation and compassion."
4631,jefferson-in-paris-movie,Eve Zibart,20,"Jefferson in Paris is nevertheless a disaster, intellectually infuriating and thoughtlessly racist."
4632,sicko-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Sicko is likely Moore's most important, most impressive, most provocative film, and it's different from his others in significant ways."
4633,live-free-or-die-hard-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"This fourth iteration of a series that first burst upon the world in 1988 turns out to be terrific entertainment, and startlingly shrewd in the bargain, a combination of minimalist performances -- interestingly minimalist -- and maximalist stunts that make you laugh, as you gape, at their thunderous extravagance."
4634,walking-with-dinosaurs-3d-movie,Geoff Pevere,38,"Unfortunately, the only thing that dies harder in the movies than natural selection is careworn cliché, and Barry Cook and Neil Nightingale’s movie about a plucky, lovestruck pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi subjects our long defunct earthly ancestors to a fate arguably worse than extinction: a life lived in a world of cheese."
4635,blood-the-last-vampire-movie,V.A. Musetto,0,"Not only isn't the new effort up to the standards of the anime, it's bloody awful by any standard."
4636,the-whistleblower-movie,Peter Travers,63,"The film swings from melodrama to sermonizing, both blunting the human drama that needs to come to the fore."
4637,just-my-luck-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,An appallingly unfunny and unromantic romantic comedy.
4638,the-us-vs-john-lennon-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"One of the best-known cultural figures of the past half-century, leaves the movie with little to do but add its sometimes sanctimonious voice to the chorus of praise and admiration."
4639,justin-bieber-never-say-never-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"If this is what it sounds like when a new millennium goes pop, I'll take it. "
4640,clueless-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"A smart and funny movie, and the characters are in on the joke."
4641,on-her-majestys-secret-service-movie,Gerardo Valero,63,"A rather uneven Bond, one with a great story but a few too many problems, belonging somewhere in the middle section of the series' canon."
4642,new-in-town-movie,Connie Ogle,38,"The ghastly first half of this romantic comedy -- is as close to unwatchable as any moment in ""Bride Wars."" The fact that it stars Renée Zellweger just makes it harder to bear."
4643,the-honeymooners-movie,Jami Bernard,38,"Cedric is certainly the bright spot in this movie - personable, silly and lovable, with just enough of Gleason's girth, timing and humanity to make you wish he'd driven Ralph Kramden's bus onto the lot of a different movie."
4644,righteous-kill-movie,Michael Sragow,38,"Under the guidance of Jon Avnet, they're (De Niro/Pacino) both playing New York police detectives - partners, no less - in the cop-and-serial-killer tale Righteous Kill, and they're thunderously mediocre."
4645,capturing-the-friedmans-movie,David Sterritt,100,A compulsively watchable movie that's also a provocative inquiry into the ability of the criminal-justice system to determine culpability and truth.
4646,the-jungle-book-2-movie,Laura Sinagra,10,"The new tunes sound like Buster Poindexter mainlining Sweet 'n Low, and at a critically song-starved moment, John Goodman's Baloo admits, ""King Louie? He split!"" Before the third defibrillation of ""Bare Necessities,"" you and your kids might too."
4647,the-diving-bell-and-the-butterfly-movie,David Denby,100,"Schnabel’s movie, based on the calm and exquisite little book that Bauby wrote in the hospital, is a gloriously unlocked experience, with some of the freest and most creative uses of the camera and some of the most daring, cruel, and heartbreaking emotional explorations that have appeared in recent movies."
4648,action-point-movie,David Ehrlich,16,"For most of its interminable runtime, Action Point feels like a porno that deliberately ruins the sex scenes in order to stop you from fast-forwarding through the plot."
4649,yoo-hoo-mrs-goldberg-movie,Andrea Gronvall,70,"It is only in the sequence about Berg's popular costar Philip Loeb that Aviva Kempner's documentary resonates. Loeb, an ardent union activist who was blacklisted during the McCarthy hearings, comes across as more identifiably human than the workaholic Berg, for all her fictional character's warmth and her many admirers' tributes."
4650,phone-booth-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,Provides a reminder of the power of unadorned drama and language -- whole torrents of eloquent words -- in the service of a nifty idea.
4651,body-of-lies-movie,William Arnold,75,"As good as it is in pieces, its protagonists are distancing, its story is tangled, its film-noir cynicism is oppressive and unglamorous, and it just doesn't leave us with the satisfying unity of the kind of great movie it wants to be."
4652,abattoir-movie,Brian Tallerico,12,The dialogue isn’t just awkward and unbelievable — it’s as if it was written by a teenager raised on only bad horror movies. 
4653,my-soul-to-take-movie,Adam Markovitz,16,"Wes Craven's first new movie in five years is a brainless, joyless, and yes, you might even say, soulless teen slasher."
4654,the-adventures-of-pluto-nash-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,A headache-inducing mess without direction or purpose.
4655,creed-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"Many of the boxing genre’s conventions are observed in the screenplay by Mr. Coogler and Aaron Covington, and the fight sequences are brutally effective.... But the film is full of life and loose humor...and Creed often transcends the genre by playing with movie mythology."
4656,i-spy-movie,Marc Savlov,20,"Just plain dismal, an inexplicable mining of old, mid-level programming that has all the raging excitement of continental drift."
4657,alex-emma-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"Emma writes everything down and then offers helpful suggestions, although she fails to supply the most useful observation of all, which would be to observe that the entire novel is complete crap."
4658,burn-after-reading-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"Beneath its movie star clowning, its awful-but-relatable heroine and its lightweight gags, Burn After Reading poses an implicit challenge to its viewers: Can you figure out why this comedy isn't very funny? Could that be because its central proposition is that the people in the theater are just as stupid, just as gullible, just as eager to be deceived as the people on the screen?"
4659,8-heads-in-a-duffel-bag-movie,Ruthe Stein,0,Exactly what the title implies: mindless.
4660,paranormal-activity-3-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"The bottom line, for me, is this: I don't scare easily at horror films, but I watched Paranormal Activity 3 in a state of high anxiety."
4661,passione-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"Actor John Turturro follows his charming and colorful travel documentary ""Rehearsal for a Sicilian Tragedy"" (2009) with this assured and freewheeling look at the music of Naples (2010). "
4662,mccanick-movie,Justin Lowe,30,"Cory Monteith in one of his last screen roles may be the best thing going for McCanick, a tired cop drama that recycles predictable narrative elements almost to the point of meaninglessness and then substitutes wildly improbable developments in place of actual originality."
4663,dead-man-on-campus-movie,Ron Stringer,20,"The fault lies mostly with the writers, who consistently come up short on wit and imagination enough to finish, let alone flesh out or polish, a joke."
4664,rocky-movie,Janet Maslin,80,"Rocky isn't really a movie about sports, but it works on the visceral level of a good sports event, generating blissfully uncomplicated excitement. [29 Nov 1976, p.113]"
4665,manderlay-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Hate is too strong an emotion to spend on such a clumsy, bloodless broadside against human foibles in general and American follies in particular."
4666,osama-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,70,Ends up being of greater historical significance than of any lasting artistic merit.
4667,stuck-on-you-movie,Jack Mathews,88,"A two-hour, one-joke comedy that never gets old, Stuck on You is the most mature, consistently funny and satisfyingly sweet movie in the rollicking careers of brother filmmakers Bobby and Peter Farrelly."
4668,spring-break-movie,Bill Cosford,25,"Implausibly, irretrievably boring -- an affront to its undemanding genre. [28 March 1983, p.C6]"
4669,riding-in-cars-with-boys-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"An overlong compendium of Oprah moments meant to move and inspire, even if, by the end, it's too exhausted with itself to offer up a single authentic tear or revelation."
4670,maria-full-of-grace-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,100,Unfolds with a simplicity that's as breathtaking as its inevitability is harrowing.
4671,over-her-dead-body-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"Over Her Dead Body is to romantic comedy what Spam is to meat. But at least with Spam, you get cool packaging."
4672,behaving-badly-movie,Gary Goldstein,0,Behaving Badly is a dreadful sex comedy that gets worse and worse as its dopey story snowballs into relative incoherence.
4673,fifty-shades-freed-movie,Josh Kupecki,11,The biggest takeaway from the film is that the American foster-care system has failed us all. And that’s super sexy.
4674,starred-up-movie,Ann Hornaday,63,"For all its savagery and hopelessness, Starred Up manages to be sympathetic, not only because of O’Connell’s galvanizing turn, but also Asser and director David Mackenzie’s unwavering commitment to portraying his character with as much compassion as brutal honesty."
4675,whipped-movie,Rita Kempley,10,Puerile bluster.
4676,the-neon-demon-movie,James Berardinelli,0,Horror fans will be so bored by the first 90 minutes that they will have either walked out or fallen into a coma by the time the blood starts flowing. 
4677,in-a-world-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,80,"Bell captures the insularity of certain professional pockets of Hollywood, with all their petty rivalries and backstabbing. But she's sharpest in her exploration of what makes women desire success, and what prevents them from getting it."
4678,our-lady-of-the-assassins-movie,Stephen Hunter,90,"It's sad, funny, shocking and completely unlike any movie in a dozen years."
4679,im-in-love-with-a-church-girl-movie,Miriam Bale,30,This is a message film with the narrative sophistication of a recruiting pamphlet.
4680,cats-dogs-movie,Jane Horwitz,80,Surprisingly witty and sophisticated spy movie spoof that will tickle adult pet lovers and still capture kids 6 and older with its boy-and-his-dog love story and pet slapstick.
4681,grown-ups-2-movie,Mark Olsen,20,Grown Ups 2 looks like it was a lot of fun to make. And the last laugh is on us.
4682,drowning-mona-movie,Gemma Files,20,"An endlessly contrived exercise in self-referential ""black comedy"", can't help but strike me as no kind of triumph of anything over anything."
4683,machuca-movie,Keith Phipps,70,"Though Machuca ultimately doesn't shy away from taking sides, it wisely keeps the focus on the human element. The politics take place in the background until they demand the foreground."
4684,borat-cultural-learnings-of-america-for-make-benefit-glorious-nation-of-kazakhstan-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Very nice. I like Borat very much. I think it is, as everybody has been saying, the funniest movie in years."
4685,gods-and-generals-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"Shot with the TV-movie blahs, the film itself is nothing more than an elaborate reenactment, perfectly mating box-of-rocks acting (bring rotten fruit for Mia Dillon's Southern matriarch) and repetitious dialogue so scripturally florid Maxwell might qualify for a Comedy Screenplay Golden Globe next January."
4686,the-waterboy-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"Sandler is making a tactical error when he creates a character whose manner and voice has the effect of fingernails on a blackboard, and then expects us to hang in there for a whole movie."
4687,kick-ass-2-balls-to-the-wall-movie,Ali Arikan,0,One of the year's worst films.
4688,crush-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,0,"The most depressing movie I've seen all year; in fact, I'm hard-pressed to name a movie aimed specifically at women that has ever made me feel as insulted and disgusted."
4689,12-angry-men-movie,William Thomas,100,"Sidney Lumet's dazzling debut, based on Reginald Rose's teleplay, delivers a masterclass in the pure dynamism of acting, as Henry Fonda's reasonable doubt gradually sways the 11 other jurors from their various prejudices. "
4690,mysteries-of-lisbon-movie,Eric Kohn,75,"A four-and-a-half hour period piece littered with interconnected events spread across many years, it moves forward with fits of intrigue, interspersed with casual developments that deaden its momentum and call into question its monumental running time. "
4691,despicable-me-movie,Carrie Rickey,63,"Short, sweet-and-sour, and amusing rather than funny, Despicable Me can't help but be likable."
4692,the-circle-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,Panahi's simplicity accentuates the movie's power: its sense of life caught unobserved.
4693,stephanie-daley-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,"With a calmness that bespeaks confidence, this small, spellbinding second feature by Hilary Brougher brings together two women, trapped in separate states of denial and distress, who manage to end each other's entrapment."
4694,underclassman-movie,Nick Sylvester,10,"British bliss czars, the doughnut-loving LAPD, and bitchin'-hot Spanish profs, no matter how many, how fat, or how bitchin' hot, can't make up for easy double entendres and zero character development."
4695,rosetta-movie,Ken Fox,70,A psychologically acute profile of one teenaged girl obsessed with leading what she thinks of as normal life.
4696,the-thomas-crown-affair-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,A romp of romantic larceny built out of spare parts we've seen in countless other films.
4697,norman-movie,Bill Weber,38,"Alternately maudlin and snarky, Norman just doesn't risk enough, and can be consigned to the status of what the school drama geek would call ""some contemporary, obscure, teen-angst thing."""
4698,something-in-the-air-movie,Oliver Lyttelton,75,"There’s so much to like about the film, and it’s a mark of Assayas’ skill that it's a hugely engaging watch despite the blankness of the characters. "
4699,house-of-wax-movie,Peter Travers,25,"Purists, be warned: This scare-flick quickie has as much relation to the 1953 Vincent Price classic with the same title as Paris Hilton does to acting."
4700,not-another-teen-movie-movie,Jonathan Foreman,38,"Toomuch of the humor in Not Another Teen Movie is either lame (the school in the movie is called ""John Hughes High"") or lamely disgusting."
4701,the-spectacular-now-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"James Ponsoldt, who directed from a script by Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter, is a bit too glib to do justice to this material, but the young actors, especially Woodley, are quite fine. "
4702,the-green-hornet-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Overblown, interminable and unfunny."
4703,town-country-movie,Jay Carr,75,"Starts out as a somewhat weary farce of infidelity, but turns into something a lot more gratifying, namely a comedy of mercy."
4704,sex-the-annabel-chong-story-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,Vacuous filmmaking of a very familiar kind.
4705,the-silence-of-the-lambs-movie,Staff [Not Credited],90,"Hopkins plays the cannibalistic doctor with a quiet, controlled erudition, lacing his performance with moments of black humor. His Lecter is a sort of satanic Sherlock Holmes whose spasms of violence are all the more terrifying because they erupt from beneath such an intelligent and refined mask."
4706,no-such-thing-movie,Derek Elley,10,"Deadly dull in stretches, and just plain embarrassing in others."
4707,shanghai-calling-movie,Matt Singer,20,"Through it all, Henney is an appealing screen presence, but he’s trapped in a movie that puts regurgitated sitcom shtick and regional economic boosterism ahead of character and humor."
4708,the-last-samurai-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,30,"Cruise pedals hard through The Last Samurai, and the exertion shows. In fact, the whole picture is belabored and lumbering."
4709,the-last-face-movie,Rory O'Connor,0,"The nonsense really is rampant throughout, but the writing is on the wall (quite literally) from the opening introductory paragraph."
4710,the-party-movie,Ty Burr,63,"The new film is a lightly poisoned amuse-bouche that’s made with tasty high-end ingredients, but at 71 minutes it leaves you hungry for more."
4711,shaft-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Shaft has everything --smart writing, shrewd direction and a handful of performances that are first-rate by any standard."
4712,monkeybone-movie,Robert Wilonsky,30,"Like a half-remembered dream, the movie's often so overwhelming that even its dull, dead moments (of which there are many, unfortunately) leave you wondering what you're missing and what you've just forgotten."
4713,secret-window-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"The tricky plot has an interesting payoff, but it's a slow and bumpy ride getting there, and Koepp fares better with special effects than with generating either suspense or interest in the characters."
4714,donnie-brasco-movie,David Ansen,90,"This is Depp's coming-of-age role, and he's terrific. Pacino, who's shown more flash than substance recently, reminds us how great he can be when he loses himself inside a character. The bond between these two makes the film sing."
4715,summer-catch-movie,Chris Hewitt,0,"Apparently, you can lead a Prinze to a movie, but you can't make him act."
4716,vacation-2015-movie,Stephanie Merry,12,"For the most part, Vacation is a sad, cynical rip-off of writer John Hughes’s source material. No one expects originality, but the new movie may end up making history: It’s already looking like the worst movie of the year."
4717,lucie-aubrac-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"Lucie Aubrac has it all: a tender romance, acute suspense, terrific acting, and a camera style and and score that are beautiful yet understated...a major work, possessing breadth, depth and passion."
4718,the-clay-bird-movie,David Rooney,70,"Accomplished, emotionally involving film."
4719,the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn---part-1-movie,Mark Jenkins,38,"The ""Twilight Saga"" hasn't matured along with its heroine. In fact, the latest movie regresses a bit, delivering more filler, less feeling and crummier CGI than last year's ""Eclipse."""
4720,the-amazing-spider-man-movie,Ann Hornaday,63,"The good news is that Garfield and Stone whip up a warm, convincing froth as two teenagers caught up in a beguiling case of puppy love. The not-so-great news is that by ""reboot,"" the studio means taking audiences once again through every step of Peter's transformation into Spider-Man."
4721,the-do-over-movie,David Ehrlich,16,"The Do-Over is atrocious, but it's atrocious in different ways than any of Adam Sandler's previous comedies."
4722,my-father-the-hero-movie,Jackie Potts,63,"My Father, the Hero is an entertaining coming-of-age comedy. [4 Feb 1994, p.G4]"
4723,game-night-movie,Gary Thompson,75,"Game Night is not the greatest comedy in the world, but it has a great grasp of the ingredient that makes comedy work, identified centuries ago as brevity."
4724,space-chimps-movie,Ty Burr,38,"Short, cheap, weird, and passably diverting."
4725,kazaam-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,"It's full of special effects that are big on smoke and noise, but short on logic and payoff."
4726,the-lone-ranger-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,38,"The movie, of course, barrels toward climax upon climax, and while possibly better photographed, the crashes, bangs, and booms are no less numbing than anything else you've seen in this summer of garbage blockbusters."
4727,her-alibi-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"Endless, pointless and ridiculous, right up to the final shot of the knife going through the cockroach. This movie is desperately bankrupt of imagination and wit, and Tom Selleck looks adrift in it."
4728,marfa-girl-movie,Odie Henderson,12,"It’s tedious at best, almost unwatchable at worst."
4729,the-hunger-games-catching-fire-movie,Claudia Puig,63,"Crowd-pleasing and compelling, most of all because of its fiery, charismatic heroine."
4730,evita-movie,Richard Harrington,70,"Evita is a busy movie with an often noisy soundtrack that can get tedious and monotonous (particularly in the second half), but it's just as likely to sweep one away with its musical, emotional and historical momentum."
4731,the-ledge-movie,Jesse Cataldo,12,"There's nothing wrong with establishing a field of unlikable characters, but The Ledge not only relies on paper-thin stereotypes, it keeps its allegiances clear from the beginning."
4732,set-it-up-movie,Kate Erbland,83,"Set It Up is a classic rom-com brought to life by a pair of wonderfully well-matched stars who seem to revel in the genre. This is cinematic comfort food, the kind we’ve been starving for."
4733,the-adventures-of-sharkboy-and-lavagirl-3-d-movie,Richard Corliss,30,"Pretty lame.  Sharkboy has an especially frantic, amateur atmosphere, with a mostly maladroit cast."
4734,scary-movie-movie,Kevin Maynard,68,"A raunchy, scattershot, but often hilarious spoof."
4735,the-invisible-circus-movie,Lisa Alspector,30,"In nearly every scene of her dangerously underwritten role, Diaz has a mouthful of cliches."
4736,casino-jack-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,25,"That's the problem with the whole movie, which lies halfway between poker-face documentary and broad farce."
4737,a-ghost-story-movie,Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,100,"A Ghost Story is filmmaking that challenges and exhilarates, a potent reminder of how many new places film can still be taken even after a century of people working in the medium."
4738,gods-of-egypt-movie,Steve Davis,0,Avoid it like the plagues.
4739,billy-elliot-movie,Peter Brunette,80,"You'll feel moved and uplifted after watching this well-written, funny movie."
4740,argo-movie,Dana Stevens,70,"Argo isn't quite on the level of the Sidney Lumet classics to which Affleck pays stylistic homage - smart and taut as it is, it lacks the broader political vision of a film like ""Dog Day Afternoon."" But Lumet lite still goes down pretty smooth."
4741,caves-of-forgotten-dreams-movie,Joe Neumaier,100,Director Werner Herzog's latest cinematic mind trip blows you away with its beauty.
4742,the-love-guru-movie,A.O. Scott,0,"The Love Guru is downright antifunny, an experience that makes you wonder if you will ever laugh again."
4743,chappaquiddick-movie,Roger Moore,63,Wandering into the unknowns doesn’t serve history or the film well enough to make Chappaquiddick anything more than cinematic escape for folks who don’t like the current history they’d rather avoid thinking about by going to the movies.
4744,crimson-gold-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,90,"An extraordinary film in many ways, the least of which is its unorthodox casting. "
4745,island-of-lemurs-madagascar-movie,Joe Morgenstern,70,"The music is shamelessly entertaining, and the warmth of Morgan Freeman's narration conveys the possibility that, for all the imminent peril, the lemurs of this enchanted forest still have a fighting chance."
4746,speed-racer-movie,Kyle Smith,12,This adventurously awful film is awful in many ways at once.
4747,the-loft-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"All the men's wives are shrews, prigs or doormats; all the conquests doe-eyed blonds with sucked-in cheeks. All the dialogue is as witty as this exchange: ""You're a sick f---!"" ""No, you're a sick f---!"" They're all sick f---s, frankly, and the actors are dreadful while playing them."
4748,coffee-and-cigarettes-movie,Glenn Kenny,88,"By the end the movie has pretty much ceased taking itself at all seriously, devolving into a nonchalant giggliness of the stoned variety that's completely apropos."
4749,fury-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"At its best, Fury examines the psychological experience of warfare. "
4750,sugar-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"The film's style is so ''objective'' it's a bit subdued, yet this is a sports drama of total originality, as well as the most authentic inside view of the immigrant experience the movies have given us in quite a while."
4751,man-on-wire-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,Engrossing and exhilarating documentary.
4752,ricki-and-the-flash-movie,Leah Greenblatt,67,"Director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Diablo Cody, both Oscar winners, have made far better films. Still, Ricki raises smart questions about why a mother’s musical ambitions are so much more selfish than, say, seven-time dad Mick Jagger’s."
4753,i-wish-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"The brothers Maeda are pure gold; the film captures what feels like effortless joy in their lives, and it is never something they seem to be reaching for. "
4754,ballistic-ecks-vs-sever-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"This movie pulls out so many bad-action-movie cliches, you wonder if this is a how-not-to primer."
4755,swamp-thing-movie,Dave Kehr,20,"Craven seems to have set out to make a bad movie, and he's succeeded."
4756,poetic-justice-movie,Mike Clark,63,John Singleton's bizarre but viewable Boyz N the Hood follow-up is surprisingly gooey going. [23 Jul 1993]
4757,28-days-movie,Charles Taylor,10,Not even court-ordered rehab could save this stumbling drunk of a picture.
4758,the-edge-of-heaven-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,Mr. Akin's film is so full of life that it leaves you breathless.
4759,3-ninjas-kick-back-movie,Jeff Shannon,38,Although it is as harmless as its predecessor - and harmless should not be mistaken for a compliment - there is only one sad conclusion to be drawn from this kind of profiteering kiddie fodder: We owe our children better than this.
4760,eye-in-the-sky-movie,Joe Morgenstern,70,"Eye in the Sky is literally all over the map in its depiction of drone warfare, and right on target, if flagrantly contrived, in examining the ethics of killing by remote control."
4761,the-meyerowitz-stories-new-and-selected-movie,Bilge Ebiri,90,"The Meyerowitz Stories doesn’t quite have the drive and stylistic panache of other recent Baumbach efforts, but it makes up for that with sincerity, as well as moments of subtle satirical genius."
4762,zoolander-2-movie,David Edelstein,10,"How bad is Zoolander 2? It’s ""Batman and Robin"" bad. It’s so bad that it makes you feel sorry for the scores (literally) of celebrities who show up in cameos, even the ones (Anna Wintour, Tommy Hilfiger, Susan Sarandon, Ariana Grande, Kimye ...) who actively resist your sympathy, whom you maybe want to see taken down a peg."
4763,pitch-perfect-3-movie,Katie Walsh,63,"Pitch Perfect 3 is so breezy it's completely weightless, but it manages to deliver just enough of the goods."
4764,hot-pursuit-movie,Betsy Sharkey,10,This is an equal-opportunity fiasco.
4765,me-myself-irene-movie,David Ansen,30,"This is a farfetched premise, and the movie pays a price for it."
4766,sweet-and-lowdown-movie,Roger Ebert,88,Sean Penn('s) performances are master classes in the art of character development.
4767,harrisons-flowers-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,"It's part travelogue in Hell, part ineffectual weepie."
4768,freedomland-movie,Michael Phillips,63,"First-rate actors bail out second-rate directors all the time, and Freedomland serves as the latest example."
4769,pulp-fiction-movie,Anthony Lane,90,"The architecture of Pulp Fiction may look skewed and strained, but the decoration is a lot of fun. [10 Oct 1994, p.95]"
4770,bridge-of-spies-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Using a screenplay polished and honed by the Coen Brothers, Spielberg dips into John le Carré territory (you can't help but think of The Spy Who Came in From the Cold when Donovan looks onto the newly erected Berlin Wall, in the searchlights, in the snow)."
4771,carlos-movie,Liam Lacey,100,"A preening terrorist for the Me generation, his primary drive was vanity and his main professional asset an absence of empathy. "
4772,waking-up-in-reno-movie,Chris Hewitt,25,It's never a good sign when a movie's credits include: ''Tony Orlando as himself.'' But the crooner is the highlight of the dreadful Waking Up in Reno.
4773,backstage-2000-movie,Wesley Morris,12,Mildly satisfying.
4774,love-is-all-you-need-movie,Rick Groen,75,"As the title more than hints, Love Is All You Need is no stranger to formulaic clichés, but it’s still a Bier film. There’s a sprinkling of vinegar in the treacle, a bit of ballast in fancy’s lightweight flight, and, of course, the triumph of optimism that can seem unearned in her dramas is made to measure in a comedy."
4775,best-man-down-movie,Tomas Hachard,25,"While it tries to relate a story about the sloppiness of life, the way best-laid plans can go wrong in an instant, its script is neatly and tidily structured."
4776,primal-fear-movie,Andrew Ross,10,"It should have been sent straight to video. As a courtroom drama, it stumbles from one ludicrous howler to another. Were the movie's ""legal technical advisers"" on another planet while the  rest of the world was learning about legal procedure courtesy of the O.J. trial?"
4777,intact-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,Convoluted.
4778,pollock-movie,Shawn Levy,83,The resulting film is a labor of love with all the strengths and weaknesses you might expect from such a designation.
4779,madeas-big-happy-family-movie,A. A. Dowd,20,"Epitomizing the shrill franchise's schizophrenic tonal shifts, Madea metes out Christian life lessons with one hand-and righteously bitch-slaps with the other."
4780,the-green-hornet-movie,Kenneth Turan,0,May not be the most tedious superhero movie ever - the competition is admittedly tough - but it is certainly in the running.
4781,dom-hemingway-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,20,"When you name your movie Dom Hemingway and then require the titular antihero to repeatedly declare, “I am Dom Hemingway!” the filmmakers must be very confident that there is something special about their character. Too bad there isn’t."
4782,mars-attacks!-movie,Rick Groen,75,"A flashy nineties flick with a campy fifties feel -- it's playful, naive, clever, silly, often inventive, occasionally uneven and, compared to studio offerings to date, the best present under this year's cinematic tree."
4783,red-dawn-movie,David Ehrlich,10,"And so, nearly four years since it rolled cameras, the sun rises on another Red Dawn, which supplements the irresponsibility of the original with an incompetency all its own."
4784,lion-movie,Clint Worthington,75,"If you’re looking for a reinvention of the biopic formula, there are plenty of films this season to set you up. If you think there’s still room for the traditional ‘true-story’ drama, Lion proves these stories still have a little life left in them."
4785,marmaduke-movie,Amy Biancolli,25,It's harmless.
4786,the-green-butchers-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,Neither funny nor outrageous nor horrifying nor conventionally affecting.
4787,8-heads-in-a-duffel-bag-movie,Bruce Fretts,0,"Aims for dark farce but ends up playing more like Weekend at Bernie's Part VIII. [25 Apr 1997, p. 50]"
4788,jawbreaker-movie,Lisa Alspector,0,"This derivative concept movie is tiresomely slick as well as shamefully sloppy, and someone should issue a restraining order requiring writer-director Darren Stein to stay at least 100 yards away from irony."
4789,waking-sleeping-beauty-movie,Tasha Robinson,91,A surprisingly intimate behind-the-scenes documentary.
4790,blind-spot-hitlers-secretary-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,Riveting.
4791,the-english-teacher-movie,Jordan Hoffman,20,Despite a lead performance by the always welcome Julianne Moore it is rudderless in its presentation and outright stupid in its central conceits.
4792,hoodwinked-too!-hood-vs-evil-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Parents should take their children to Hoodwinked Too! Hood Vs. Evil, if only because kids are never too young to learn the important and liberating skill of walking out of a movie and demanding a refund."
4793,knockaround-guys-movie,Gene Seymour,30,"Certainly, Malkovich's portrayal of mob lieutenant Teddy Deserve (!) and his lacquered swagger represent the only thing here that you haven't seen a hundred times before."
4794,baby-geniuses-movie,Peter Stack,0,A stupid comedy with toddlers talking like hip '90s grown-ups.
4795,snow-day-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,38,"Unless you have a craving to watch a sluggish Ski-Doo race or want to admire Chase dressed as a hula dancer, consider this the cinematic equivalent of yellow snow."
4796,riddick-movie,Bilge Ebiri,30,"As a result, we get relatively little insight into the other characters as they react to Riddick. Without an unknown force to spark our own imaginations, the result is mostly dead air. "
4797,jigsaw-movie,Emily Yoshida,10,"Watching Jigsaw go about his torture business is about as interesting as watching a child burn ants — a dumb and ugly waste of energy, resources and time."
4798,halloween-the-curse-of-michael-myers-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"Easily the most inept episode of the Halloween series, The Curse of Michael Myers, which opened yesterday, is so busy cramming half-baked supernatural rigmarole into its formula that it has forgotten how to be suspenseful. "
4799,grace-unplugged-movie,Andy Webster,30,Feels like a religious tract more than a movie.
4800,company-man-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,20,"A frenetic spoof of 1961's disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, Company Man is likely to be forgotten quickly by audiences."
4801,frankenweenie-movie,Liam Lacey,75,"You have to feel pleased just for the existence of a film like Tim Burton's Frankenweenie. A 3-D, black-and-white, stop-motion animated film, it's a one-man blow for cinematic biodiversity. "
4802,savages-movie,Steve Persall,25,An amoral mosaic of carnage and carnality.
4803,a-beautiful-mind-movie,Edward Guthmann,100,"Inspiring and largely unsentimental, this is as much a love story as a tale of courage."
4804,deepwater-horizon-movie,Roger Moore,75,"Berg reminds us that even in the worst disaster, people can be selfless, heroic, and in the case of Aaron Dale Burkeen, professional even if those who gamble with their fates are not."
4805,silver-city-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,"Silver City may be the mustiest political-conspiracy tale ever filmed; it's like ""Chinatown"" rewritten by Ralph Nader."
4806,the-big-hit-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"Though R-rated, its real target audience is under 18 -- either in years or IQ points."
4807,inception-movie,Ann Hornaday,88,"Inception is that rare film that can be enjoyed on superficial and progressively deeper levels, a feat that uncannily mimics the mind-bending journey its protagonist takes."
4808,the-woman-on-the-6th-floor-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"There are few reasons you must see this movie, but absolutely none that you should not. "
4809,coyote-ugly-movie,A.O. Scott,10,Looks like a big-budget version of a Miller's Genuine Draft commercial.
4810,suddenly-movie,Allison Benedikt,75,"At first look, it's a stark and thin story of misguided youth. But give it a week. The girls stay with you, the small moments echo, and you realize that, though this movie doesn't lend itself to a punchy summary, it lends itself to the screen. "
4811,harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-movie,Michael Atkinson,70,"A mild upkick in pacing and texture can be credited to director Alfonso Cuarón (more Little Princess than Y Tu Mamá), who avoids Chris Columbus's mastodon-like setups and knows a bit more about whipping up atmospherics."
4812,the-vanishing-of-sidney-hall-movie,Kate Erbland,16,"Initially it seems as if Sidney Hall will just be another film about lone geniuses trapped in worlds where they’re misunderstood or undervalued, but the film then unspools into nearly two hours of baffling narrative choices, weak character development, and so many offensive cliches that it would be funny if it wasn’t so, well, offensive."
4813,paradise-road-movie,Emanuel Levy,70,"Though carefully rendered from a historical perspective, this powerful account of female friendship and bonding under the most cruel conditions lacks the narrative focus and dramatic shapeliness to generate emotional excitement."
4814,mudbound-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"A vividly acted, dramatically rich depiction, harsh and beautiful, of life and death in 1940s Mississippi, following two families of intertwined destinies."
4815,answers-to-nothing-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,30,"You know it's not working when you don't care about any of them. Sadly, that's the case with Answers to Nothing, Matthew Leutwyler's dud about a revolving cast of characters in Los Angeles."
4816,the-monster-movie,Roger Moore,38,"The Monster is as dull and predictable as its title, a creature feature in which the melodramatic flashbacks are the only bits with bite."
4817,hello-i-must-be-going-movie,Andrew Schenker,75,"Thanks to Melanie Lynskey's performance, the movie feels like a believably worked-out, sympathetically presented study in thirtysomething uncertainty."
4818,meet-joe-black-movie,Jack Kroll,0,Every once in a while a film comes along that's so inexplicably ghastly that there's just no point in making nice about it. 
4819,gloria-movie,Godrey Cheshire ,10,"A travesty trying to be a Sharon Stone vehicle, this wooden crime yarn easily qualifies as the most tired, unexciting mob movie in recent memory."
4820,hot-tub-time-machine-2-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,This version of the time machine is more powerful — it’s made me go back and hate the original.
4821,the-island-movie,Peter Travers,38,"A borrowed idea -- hello, ""Blade Runner,"" hi there, ""Matrix"" -- but an idea nonetheless."
4822,the-medallion-movie,Roger Moore,38,"The supernatural stuff is ho-hum, the dubbing is sloppy and the action will only make you pine for the younger, hungrier and more injury-prone Jackie."
4823,the-master-movie,Xan Brooks,100,"The themes may be contentious, but the handling is perfect. If there were ever a movie to cause the lame to walk and the blind to see, The Master may just be it."
4824,12-strong-movie,Keith Watson,25,"As Nicolai Fuglsig doesn't allow any complicated thoughts about war, colonization, and mortality to hover around his characters, 12 Strong inevitably proceeds as a jaunty imperial adventure through the wilds of northern Afghanistan."
4825,deepwater-horizon-movie,Bob Mondello,85,"An action flick entertaining enough to justify the more than $100 million it took to make it come alive on-screen. And come alive, Deepwater Horizon does, in 107 minutes of terse, tight storytelling, a good 95 of which are white-knuckle tense."
4826,weekend-movie,Alison Willmore,100,"Bittersweet, achingly authentic, and so intimate it almost feels invasive."
4827,leatherface-texas-chainsaw-massacre-iii-movie,John Hartl,25,"The Museum of Modern Art has committed Tobe Hooper's original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) to its permanent collection. This spin-off, which has none of that film's brutal energy, won't be joining it. The state of Texas ought to sue the makers of Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III for defamation of character. [13 Jan 1990, p.C5]"
4828,gun-shy-2017-movie,John DeFore,10,A giant thud of a film that makes one doubt the fact that West ever directed a proper Hollywood movie.
4829,spartacus-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"Much as it owes to Kubrick, Spartacus owes even more to its script, which Scenarist Trumbo has adorned with humor, eloquence, sophistication and a corrosive irony. Above all, despite his personal predilection for the 20th century's most crushing political orthodoxy, Trumbo has imparted to Spartacus a passion for freedom and the men who live and die for it —a passion that transcends all politics and persons in the fearful, final image of the dying gladiator, the revolutionary on the cross."
4830,kings-queen-movie,Kyle Smith,88,"A long, messy cinematic novel full of hate, love, murder, ghosts, madness, poetry and Catherine Deneuve."
4831,agent-cody-banks-movie,Megan Lehmann,12,"The cheap-looking special effects, embarrassingly clunky attempts at humor and one-dimensional characters are bad enough, but the PG-rated movie's most offensive crime is its uncomfortably lewd interactions between adults and kids."
4832,knockaround-guys-movie,Ed Park,10,The only drama is in waiting to hear how John Malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line.
4833,sils-maria-movie,Eric Kohn,91,The typically great Binoche conveys a tantalizing mixture of confidence and unease as she considers her glamorous past and undetermined future.
4834,beast-movie,Chuck Bowen,63,"The narrative has a gambit that steers Beast into the terrain of a horror film, offsetting the sentimentality of the audience-flattering romance."
4835,wonder-woman-movie,Kate Erbland,91,"Wonder Woman is as much about a superhero rising as it is about a world deserving of her, and Diana’s hard-won insistence on battling for humanity (no matter how frequently they disappoint) adds the kind of gravitas and emotion that establishes it as the very best film the DCEU has made yet. There’s only one word for it: wonderful."
4836,six-degrees-of-separation-movie,Jay Carr,88,"It's got sharp wit and a wise heart, and as good as it was onstage, it's even better as a movie. [22 Dec 1993, p.33]"
4837,fun-with-dick-and-jane-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,The material has been dumbed down for contemporary tastes and Carrey's frantic comic style.
4838,fletch-movie,Gene Siskel,88,"Fletch is more than funny; it's funny and exciting.[31 May 1985, p.A]"
4839,the-memory-of-a-killer-movie,Kenneth Turan,80,"This is one terrific thriller with several wicked tricks up its sleeve, each more satisfying than the last."
4840,we-are-the-best!-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Funny, passionate, full of compassion for its just-pubescent protagonists, We Are the Best! is a total charmer."
4841,the-ladykillers-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"Done with an enticing mixture of lacerating comedy, lush Roger Deakins cinematography, robust acting and juicy lines, the Coens' Ladykillers is often glorious fun to watch. It won't please everyone, of course. "
4842,it-might-get-loud-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,An empty exercise.
4843,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Guaranteed to inspire many more belly laughs than it does actual shivers. Boo, scary? I think not."
4844,the-last-witch-hunter-movie,Andy Webster,20,"A smorgasbord of empty calories, the Vin Diesel vehicle The Last Witch Hunter, for all its overstuffed visuals, leaves you hungry. But not for more."
4845,dead-man-on-campus-movie,Liam Lacey,0,"The product of a first-time director and writers who have no sense of scene structure or shape, or even a discernible sense of humour. "
4846,war-dogs-movie,Eric Henderson,25,"The film is unrepentantly cynical when it comes to the global business of warmongering, but proves unsurprisingly earnest when it comes to the lure of the American dream."
4847,the-grand-budapest-hotel-movie,Eric Kohn,91,"While it has many familiar ingredients — from the atmosphere to the ensemble of Anderson regulars in nearly every role — in its allegiance to Anderson's vision, everything about The Grand Budapest Hotel is a welcome dose of originality."
4848,bullet-to-the-head-movie,Ann Hornaday,25,"Hill and Stallone seem determined simply to prove that, even in their golden years, they're still tough enough to rumble with all comers. Bullet to the Head exposes that bravado for the pose that it is, and it's not a good look."
4849,strange-magic-movie,Ed Gonzalez,12,"As juvenile and frivolous a wish-fulfillment fantasy as one might expect from the visionary behind the lightsaber and Princess Leia hogtied to Jabba the Hut, Strange Magic depicts war as a series of scarcely muddied binary oppositions: between good and evil, the beautiful and the ugly, and singing and death by karaoke."
4850,dudley-do-right-movie,Michael Atkinson,26,"You'd think creating confusion during something as woodenly simpleminded as Dudley Do-Right is no easy task, but you'd be wrong."
4851,dallas-buyers-club-movie,David Edelstein,80,"Despite its downbeat context (a plague at its height), the movie is a crowd-­pleaser — graceful and funny enough to distract you from its gaps and elisions."
4852,money-monster-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"A stodgy, moribund plodder loaded with stock characters that wouldn’t have felt edgy in 1983 and has about the same contemporary urgency as your average late-night rerun of “CSI: NY.”"
4853,butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid-movie,Nathan Rabin,91,"Though Hall's stunning vistas and gorgeous exploration of wide-open spaces hearken back to John Ford, Butch Cassidy otherwise radiates the youthful energy, manic pop playfulness, and antic clowning of the French New Wave. "
4854,fifty-shades-darker-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,30,This is a horrible movie. Which makes it not a lot different from the first film.
4855,lebanon-movie,Walter Addiego,75,"As good as the film is in conveying the feeling of the walls closing in, it has to be said that the script won't win any prizes for subtlety - the director seems to relish ham-fisted ironies."
4856,peter-pan-movie,Sean Axmaker,100,"Like the schoolkids in this adventure, from the opening images to the closing credits, I do, I do, I do believe in fairy tales."
4857,john-dies-at-the-end-movie,Nick Pinkerton,10,"John Dies at the End is a product of a parallel universe where slacker flippancy never got old-and, oh, it is terrible."
4858,in-the-land-of-blood-and-honey-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"Danijel, who cares for Ajla while at the same time carrying out his mission of ethnic cleansing, is the least fully explored character in the movie, which leaves a big blur at its core. Still, this is an impressive piece of work that doesn't flinch from the atrocities that no doubt motivated Jolie to make the film in the first place. "
4859,jupiter-ascending-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Heaping derision on such a woeful debut may be tantamount to shooting fossils in a tar pit. Yet this lumbering industrial enterprise, which was written and directed by the Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana, is bad enough to be granted landmark status."
4860,the-girl-2012-movie,Rodrigo Perez,67,"Anyone who finds this conclusion a humanistic or socially reprehensible dealbreaker can hardly be faulted. Before these questionable issues come to a head and then falter in the finale, there is a lot of value in The Girl."
4861,sleeping-with-other-people-movie,Kate Erbland,83,"Headland doesn’t entirely subvert the romantic comedy genre here, but she certainly has fun twisting up some of its most obvious tropes for a little added pizzazz and some major laughs."
4862,magnus-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,70,The loneliness of the long-distance chess grandmaster is affectingly conveyed in Magnus.
4863,16-blocks-movie,Shawn Levy,67,"Has a sweaty, weary, often intimate feel, with the human aspect dominating the mechanistic. Donner can't help but push it over the top now and again, like a bodybuilder flexing his muscles when he spots a potential mate. But he contents himself with aiming for small virtues more often than grand impact."
4864,seven-psychopaths-movie,Marc Mohan,83,"Consistently surprising, Seven Psychopaths ultimately plays like a combination of Quentin Tarantino's self-aware, savvy ultraviolence and Charlie Kaufman's reflexive head trips. And that potentially awkward combo goes down like a chocolate-vanilla swirl cone, only with more guns. "
4865,good-luck-chuck-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Good Luck Chuck, a fungal little sex comedy, doesn't need a review. It needs a tube of ointment and a shot of penicillin."
4866,super-fly-movie,Staff (Not Credited),80,This interesting feature is one of the few Hollywood films that takes an honest look at the lives of African-Americans in the ghetto. 
4867,darling-companion-movie,Ty Burr,63,"Darling Companion would be instantly forgettable if not for Keaton, who imbues Beth with a sorrow, warmth, wisdom, and rage that feel earned."
4868,ghost-movie,Peter Travers,38,"Though saddled with hoary jokes, Goldberg at least pumps some funky life into the bland proceedings."
4869,safe-haven-movie,Peter Travers,0,I hate Safe Haven. It's a terrible thing to do to your Valentine.
4870,august-rush-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"This is the sort of movie that requires you not only to suspend disbelief, but to check your sanity at the ticket counter."
4871,queen-and-country-movie,Godfrey Cheshire,88,"Given its loose-knit narrative, the film doesn’t have anything like a conventional structure. Yet it’s steadily engrossing due to Boorman’s surpassing skills as both a storyteller and a director."
4872,everything-is-illuminated-movie,Liam Lacey,63,"Schreiber has one major casting coup in Eugene Hutz, the New York-based Ukrainian/Gypsy/Punk musician who plays Alex."
4873,i-am-love-movie,Mark Jenkins,65,"Despite the contrived climax, I Am Love has emotional power. The contrast between duty and passion is well-drawn, and Swinton's transition from winter matriarch to springtime lover is compelling, even if the circumstances are implausible."
4874,x-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,It bored me clean out of my wits.
4875,summer-hours-movie,J.R. Jones,100,Extraordinary 2008 French drama.
4876,extreme-ops-movie,Bruce Fretts,16,Less a movie than a 93-minute Mountain Dew commercial.
4877,the-trip-2011-movie,J. Hoberman,80,"The verbal jousts are droll and the countryside is splendid, although the food - an endless succession of fussy little presentations - may be an acquired taste."
4878,the-women-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,It's not every movie that makes you wish Vin Diesel would run in and start blowing up stuff.
4879,dan-in-real-life-movie,Michael Phillips,88,As a director Hedges is smart enough to allow his actors to share the frame and interact and let the material breathe.
4880,north-by-northwest-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"Smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining, North by Northwest wears its implausibilities lightly, bobs swiftly past colored picture postcard backgrounds from Madison Avenue to South Dakota's Mount Rushmore, the U.N. Secretariat to George Washington's wattles."
4881,capturing-the-friedmans-movie,Sean Axmaker,100,"What's most devastating in Capturing the Friedmans is how Jarecki puts the sureness of justice into doubt as he shows Truth (with a capital T) at the mercy of perspective and perception, context and emotion."
4882,a-knights-tale-movie,Michael Sragow,38,The result is as flat as a year-old beer commercial.
4883,the-water-diviner-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,"The story takes some unexpected turns, which Crowe handles well, without overplaying them. Overall, The Water Diviner is a solid effort, a good, old-fashioned movie when it's not delving into soap opera."
4884,cedar-rapids-movie,Nick de Semlyen,80,One of those sunny-natured indie comedies that comes out of nowhere to put a smile on your face. 
4885,captain-phillips-movie,Steve Persall,100,"At this point in his celebrated career, there shouldn't be much new that Hanks can show us. But there is, as the actor reaches deep inside to express the relief of dodging death as I've never seen it played before. He's in shock; we're awed."
4886,the-informant!-movie,Michael Sragow,75,"It wouldn't stick in the memory were it not for Matt Damon's audacious, baggy-pants portrayal of corporate whistle-blower Mark Whitacre, the antihero of this reality-based farce."
4887,the-house-i-live-in-movie,Manohla Dargis,80,"It's easy to take issue with a documentary like The House I Live In, which tackles too much in too brief a time and glosses over complexities, yet this is also a model of the ambitious, vitalizing activist work that exists to stir the sleeping to wake. "
4888,all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane-movie,Kyle Smith,25,Drifts awkwardly between popcorn entertainment and angsty mood piece.
4889,wild-hogs-movie,Peter Rainer,0,The subculture of weekend warrior bikers is such rich comic material that the ineptitude of Wild Hogs is doubly offensive.

4891,my-mother-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,10,Involves such a disturbing blend of unhealthy mother-son affection and physical pain that it gives new meaning to the term child -- not to mention audience -- abuse.
4892,adore-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,25,"So deadly serious and yet so goofily unbound that, in some scenes, incest truly seems like it's on the scandalous menu."
4893,paranormal-activity-the-ghost-dimension-movie,Peter Sobczynski,12,The sixth time is not the charm with this load of hooey that tries to make up for its lack of legitimate scares or basic narrative clarity by adding the alleged miracle of 3-D into the mix.
4894,spring-breakers-movie,Xan Brooks,80,"Full credit to Korine, who sustains this act of creative vandalism right through to the finish. Spring Breakers unfolds as a fever dream of teenage kicks, a high-concept heist movie with mescal in the fuel tank."
4895,the-replacements-movie,Wesley Morris,12,Like two hours of outtakes in search of a studio audience.
4896,premonition-movie,William Arnold,25,"This is a much dumber movie than ""The Lake House."" In fact, the script is an ungainly mess and ultimately a shaggy-dog story."
4897,jurassic-park-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Colossal entertainment -- the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year."
4898,untitled-sam-raimi-horror-project-movie,Chris Cabin,12,Remarkable only in how brazenly it embraces the tired yet proven formula that these modern ghost tales deal in.
4899,the-young-victoria-movie,Phil Hall,30,Emily Blunt’s Victoria and Rupert Friend’s Albert come across like museum mannequins – utterly devoid of any genuine passion.
4900,ted-movie,Nathan Rabin,75,"Ted is never stronger than when Wahlberg and MacFarlane's Ted hang out, riff, and luxuriate in an easy friendship, but as it lurches to a conclusion, Ted unwisely devotes far too much of its time to a plot it would be better off ignoring. "

4902,what-lies-beneath-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"As it unwinds, What Lies becomes both masterful and preposterous."
4903,gone-girl-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,70,"The movie, while entertaining and extremely well crafted, is too self-conscious about its depravity to be either truly disturbing or disturbingly funny. Ticking along with metronome-like efficiency, it's more slick than sick."
4904,bruno-movie,Claudia Puig,75,Brüno offers more shock value for your moviegoing dollar than any other movie this year.
4905,four-weddings-and-a-funeral-movie,Todd McCarthy,90,Truly beguiling romantic comedy.
4906,enders-game-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"Ender’s Game, the book, may have a special place in pop-lit. The movie, however, is as special as a migraine."
4907,three-identical-strangers-movie,Roger Moore,88,"There have been better documentaries this year, but none of them are the roller-coaster ride that Three Identical Strangers turns out to be."
4908,walle-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"Daring and traditional, groundbreaking and familiar, apocalyptic and sentimental, Wall-E gains strength from embracing contradictions that would destroy other films."
4909,the-late-bloomer-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"Lead actor Johnny Simmons fits his role perfectly, his baby face giving him the suitable appearance of an overgrown adolescent. But the smutty, tired material with which he has to work is surprisingly devoid of laughs."
4910,another-48-hrs-movie,Richard Schickel,10,"Judged purely by what director Walter Hill has put on the screen, Another 48 Hrs. is a movie mainly about the several pretty ways that glass shatters when bullets or bodies are propelled through it. [25 June 1990, p.77]"
4911,crash-1997-movie,Michael Sragow,0,"Cult auteur David Cronenberg crashes and burns--his talent, that is--in Crash, a vain attempt at a techno-age Persona."
4912,the-station-agent-movie,Lawrence Toppman,88,"His height didn't stop independent writer-director Thomas McCarthy from casting his friend in The Station Agent, scoring a triumph for both. "
4913,genius-within-the-inner-life-of-glenn-gould-movie,Mark Jenkins,70,"A fine overview, with enough new material to please Gould buffs. But the film fails to demonstrate that conventional biography is the best path to its subject's inner life. "
4914,jurassic-world-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Jurassic World is an intelligent action movie that’s saying something simple but true: Yes, people are that stupid."
4915,crazy-eyes-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,An appreciation that the pain is personal doesn't compensate for the picture's self-absorbed need to alienate.
4916,echoes-of-war-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Echoes of War needs prettier visuals and bigger ideas, because the dialogue is too formulaic and the violence to come is entirely too predictable to hold our interest for 100 minutes."
4917,13-going-on-30-movie,Connie Ogle,63,"Garner may be a study in butt-kicking intensity on TV's Alias, but here, she's an engaging comic performer who more than carries her share of what is essentially an unoriginal, mostly average film. "
4918,michael-collins-movie,Alison Macor,67,"Neeson's performance as the legendary Irishman reminds us of how large a presence the actor is: He fills up the frame with his voice, his hands, and his gestures."
4919,young-adult-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"A fat streak of melancholy courses throughout Young Adult - who would have guessed the sight of a Kentaco Hut, one of those one-stop conglomerations of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, could be this depressing?"
4920,the-jacket-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"The Jacket is doing nothing but sampling elements of ""Jacob's Ladder,"" ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Memento"" without offering more than hackneyed solutions, including a rather cheesy conclusion."
4921,everything-everything-movie,Sheri Linden,70,"Jolts of humor and fantasy bring welcome texture to the romance-novel sleekness, as do the leads, who both have an uncommon, idiosyncratic allure."
4922,an-officer-and-a-gentleman-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"An Officer and a Gentleman deserves a 21-gun salute, maybe 42. Rarely does a film come along with so many finely-drawn characters to care about."
4923,basic-instinct-2-movie,William Arnold,25,"In a better movie, this grand-dame performance might have been fun, but it's surrounded here by an impossibly dull and unsatisfying whodunit plot, unintentionally funny dialogue and such absurdities as having Catherine stay up late one night and whip out an entire novel."
4924,the-betrayal---nerakhoon-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"The result is imperfect, but its roughness is entirely consistent with the way the filmmakers understand the traumatic experiences of displacement, loss and deprivation."
4925,journey-2-the-mysterious-island-movie,John DeFore,0,The movie's flexibility with its own rules would be less noticeable if it were busy thrilling us.
4926,imaginary-heroes-movie,Owen Gleiberman,16,"Nothing in Imaginary Heroes rings true, least of all a plot that lightly combines domestic abuse, adulterous pregnancy, teen bisexuality, job abandonment, and a possible case of Mysterious Movie Disease. These are not ordinary people. Or real ones."
4927,daddys-home-2-movie,Soren Andersen,25,A colossal waste of time and the moviegoer’s dollars. That’s the bottom line of Daddy’s Home 2.

4929,cop-out-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,Repeatedly shoots for laughs -- but ends up mostly firing blanks.
4930,kitchen-stories-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"There's nothing casual about the way this film has been put together, yet that painstaking care leads to laughter that is completely unrestrained."
4931,mc5-a-true-testimonial-movie,A.O. Scott,80,"The proto-punk warriors known as the MC5 left a dent that outlasts their mostly negligible record sales, and the director's curiosity is piqued by the group's sociological impact."
4932,white-bird-in-a-blizzard-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Whatever its intent, White Bird in a Blizzard misuses most everybody involved, especially the dazzling young star of “The Descendants,””The Fault in Our Stars” and “Divergent.”"
4933,true-romance-movie,Kenneth Turan,10,"It is hard to say what is more dispiriting about True Romance the movie itself or the fact that someone somewhere is sure to applaud its hollow, dime-store nihilism and smug pseudo-hip posturing as a bright new day in American cinema. [10 Sept 1993]"
4934,enough-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"In one respect at least, the film's idiocy works for Lopez: Every diva needs at least one camp classic on her résumé, and with Enough, she's scored a howler on the level of ""Mommie Dearest."""
4935,hudson-hawk-movie,Janet Maslin,10,A colossally sour and ill-conceived misfire.
4936,trouble-every-day-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,33,"A demented, orgiastically gory vampire/sex parable."
4937,ouija-movie,Robert Abele,30,"The ghost scenario that this boring, CW-ready, ""Scooby-Doo"" gang uncovers isn't nearly as shocking as the blasé attitude they have toward friends dying off."
4938,michael-jordan-to-the-max-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"For any of you who've ever daydreamed of playing hoops with Jordan, Michael Jordan to the Max is almost certainly the closest you'll ever get."
4939,barbershop-the-next-cut-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Overlong, polished but drab civics lesson of a comedy. This “Barbershop” is in sore need of a trim, and not just a little off the top, either."
4940,in-the-land-of-blood-and-honey-movie,Karina Longworth,10,The denouement that sorts it all out moves from predictable tragedy to ludicrous redemption; closing titles confirm that the motivating intent in making In the Land of Blood and Honey was activist rather than artistic.
4941,seven-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,This homicide thriller has a tantalizingly morbid atmosphere of unease.
4942,bullet-head-movie,Rex Reed,0,Vile.
4943,jawbreaker-movie,Mark Caro,38,"It's not particularly funny or trenchant, and its portrayal of noxious high school cliques never amounts to more than was shown in ""Heathers."" [19 Feb 1999]"
4944,uptown-girls-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,20,"None of it is handled with any emotional believability or grace. Well-worn phrases and plot developments are repeated here as though the world had never heard of ""Cinderella."""
4945,nico-and-dani-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,80,"Touching, funny, unflinching and true."
4946,enron-the-smartest-guys-in-the-room-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,80,"It's a story of jaw-dropping chutzpah, grim, mostly hindsight-based humor and more stomach-churning drama than you could find in 10 screenplays."
4947,bedazzled-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,The opposite of memorable.
4948,il-postino-the-postman-movie,James Berardinelli,100,A charming piece of cinema that takes several comfortable formulas and expands upon them in ingenious and emotionally-satisfying ways.
4949,callas-forever-movie,Phil Hall,30,An Italian-British-French-Spanish-Romanian co-production. A better argument against multinational cooperation cannot be imagined.
4950,manchester-by-the-sea-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,100,"It's the kind of movie you'll want to see a second time with someone who hasn't seen it yet, to remember what it was like to watch it for the first time."
4951,reach-me-movie,Jesse Hassenger,25,"There are great L.A. ensembles, like ""Short Cuts"" ""Magnolia,"" or ""Jackie Brown,"" but writer-director John Herzfeld is an expert in the bad kind, having made ""2 Days In The Valley."" "
4952,cold-weather-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"The result is pretty entertaining, though most of that entertainment derives from Katz's skillful exploitation of gumshoe formula."
4953,the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-movie,Rene Rodriguez,38,"This new, presumably improved Chainsaw is just as humorless as the original, but it's also slicker, glossier and resoundingly artificial."
4954,the-aristocrats-movie,Allison Benedikt,75,"But though you'll laugh your head off, the whole film kind of morphs into a blur, with one poop/sex/abuse joke after another. It's exhausting, really. And save for the very best tellings, you do start to wonder: What's so funny?"
4955,bless-the-child-movie,Kevin Thomas,10,Lapses into an exercise in foolishness.
4956,juno-movie,Desson Thomson,90,"Not only gives us a superb new cast of believable characters, it transcends its own genre. Only superficially a teen comedy, the movie redounds with postmodern -- but emotionally genuine -- gravitas."
4957,point-break-2015-movie,Noel Murray,30,"The newly released Point Break remake is tedious and overblown — as though the filmmakers were so preoccupied with ""updating"" the material that they forgot what made it so popular in the first place."
4958,whipped-movie,Lisa Alspector,20,"This gross sex farce actually has a point, though about half the population won't like what it is."

4960,funny-games-2008-movie,Rick Kisonak,80,"By and large, reviewers have conceded that the picture is exceptionally gripping and suspenseful while deriding its moral subtext as a crock. The only explanation possible for such fuming pettiness, in my opinion, is the fact that Michael Haneke isn’t one of us."
4961,fifty-shades-darker-movie,Allison Shoemaker,16,"Dull at best, damaging at worst, and not worth a moment of your time."

4969,thanks-for-sharing-movie,David Edelstein,70,Thanks for Sharing is never quite crazy or funny enough to transcend its “disease-of-month” template. The title turns out to not be ironic — a mixed blessing.

4972,red-riding-hood-movie,Mary Pols,10,Was Red Riding Hood masterminded by a cadre of particularly silly 11-year-olds undergoing withdrawal from Twilight? That's the only excuse for a movie this dopey.
4973,immortals-movie,Todd Gilchrist,80,"Spectacle and spectacular are often confused for one another in stories of epic adventure, but Immortals is the rare film where they are one and the same. "
4974,black-snake-moan-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,70,"A wild and sweet little picture about sex, redemption and music, though perhaps not necessarily in that order."
4975,imagine-that-movie,Scott Tobias,25,"Though he commits to a lot of embarrassing silliness, Murphy projects so little genuine warmth that his transformation barely registers."
4976,the-revenant-2015-movie,Richard Roeper,100,"The Revenant is a visceral sensation, filled with unforgettable visuals and memorable set pieces."
4977,shoot-em-up-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,20,"The picture is just a catalog of strained camera moves and preprogrammed gags, with no wit or style."
4978,murder-by-numbers-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,20,"This premise could, just maybe, make for a decent thriller, but everything about Murder by Numbers is so flavorless and rote, so devoid of real suspense and human interest, that you never suspect for a moment that the answers are likely to be engaging."
4979,the-tale-of-despereaux-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,30,The lesson learned from The Tale of Despereaux is that an overabundance of vocal talent does not a good cartoon make.
4980,the-wilde-wedding-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,10,"The soullessness of the enterprise is staggering. Making clichéd, cynical gestures toward romance, Mr. Harris (whose last feature was almost a decade ago) tortured me for a full 96 minutes."
4981,never-let-me-go-movie,Peter Travers,88,"The melancholy attached to the impermanence of life and love suffuses this film, making it memorably haunting and hypnotic."

4988,american-mary-movie,Rex Reed,0,The acting is uniformly dreadful. The level of incompetence in both writing and direction is a scream.

4990,the-fast-runner-atanarjuat-movie,J. Hoberman,100,"So elemental in its means yet so cosmic in its drama, it could herald a rebirth of cinema."
4991,the-gatekeepers-movie,Scott Tobias,91,"The six men have different personalities that suggest varying styles of leadership, but what's remarkable about The Gatekeepers is how they speak in one voice about the moral complexities of their former jobs and their extreme pessimism about the future."

4993,seraphine-movie,Frank Scheck,80,Moving historical drama brings a fascinating chapter of art history to life.
4994,the-wedding-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"To say that Justin Zackham’s farce The Big Wedding takes the low road doesn’t begin to do justice to the sheer awfulness of this star-stuffed, potty-mouthed fiasco."
4995,the-nice-guys-movie,Rex Reed,0,"This one, by the jarringly untalented writer-director Shane Black, is merely violent, vulgar and stupid."
4996,dirty-grandpa-movie,Glenn Kenny,0,"The movie is so incredibly consistent in failing to land an honest laugh that about an hour into it, its not being funny becomes laughable."
4997,vicky-cristina-barcelona-movie,Michael Phillips,75,I enjoyed it as much as any Allen film of the last 20 years.
4998,the-swamp-movie,Stephen Holden,90,"As La Ciénaga perspires from the screen, it creates a vision of social malaise that feels paradoxically familiar and new."
4999,parkland-movie,Oliver Lyttelton,16,"There's a pleasing egalitarianism to the film's history-through-the-eyes-of-the-ordinary-man concept, but the script rarely makes the case that their versions are compelling enough to warrant a film."
5000,dont-worry-he-wont-get-far-on-foot-movie,Gary Thompson,75,"The cast is uniformly fine, although Rooney Mara is stuck playing a composite of various women that feels, well, like a composite of various women."
5001,the-man-nobody-knew-in-search-of-my-father-cia-spymaster-william-colby-movie,Steven Rea,88,"At once a deeply personal film and an important historical document, The Man Nobody Knew leaves us with an incomplete portrait of a man. Did Colby have a moral core? Did he know what was truth, and what was a lie? Did he sanction assassination plots? Did he love his family? Was he even capable of love?"
5002,contact-movie,David Sterritt,75,"Its discussions don't go very deep, and moviegoers with strong religious values may wonder why it comes down for humanism over spirituality."
5003,jason-goes-to-hell-the-final-friday-movie,Avis L. Weatherbee,12,"Not that anyone expected logic, but no one expected the series to so completely abandon much of what was familiar to the audience and become an amalgam of countless other horror-fantasies and pop culture media. [16 Aug 1993, p.24]"
5004,the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl-movie,Ty Burr,100,"The heroine’s voice-overs, delivered into the microphone of a Bell & Howell tape recorder in Minnie’s bedroom, are the movie’s motor. They’re proud and insecure, profanely comic, dripping with adolescent wisdom and self-absorption."
5005,saving-silverman-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,0,"In one rotten production -- all involved have managed to create the most unlikable, man hating, woman hating, unfunny idiots since ''Whipped'' ended up on worst movie lists last year."
5006,the-last-airbender-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"A dull, boring, poorly acted, limply written and thoroughly unappealing fantasy, featuring bland characters locked in a struggle of no interest."
5007,land-of-mine-movie,Brad Wheeler,75,"Writer-director Zandvliet has crafted a handsome, affecting and questioning film about post-war revenge and forgiveness. On a tough field to navigate, he makes it to the other side, commendably."
5008,me-without-you-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Though it boasts excellent performances by Anna Friel and Michelle Williams as bosom buddies whose lives meander over three decades, it plods on with a wearying predictability and some truly terrible dialogue."
5009,fair-game-movie,David Lyman,0,"Surely, they couldn't be true. Surely, supermodel Cindy Crawford's Fair Game - her debut as a feature film star - couldn't be as bad as the gossip suggested. [03 Nov 1995]"

5021,vanilla-sky-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"Overblown and idiotic, this new ""erotic thriller"" is neither erotic nor thrilling; it's long, boring and self-indulgent."
5022,intolerable-cruelty-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"The movie has many scenes of delicious comedy, Clooney and Zeta-Jones play their characters perfectly in an imperfect screenplay."
5023,bless-the-child-movie,Sara Wildberger,12,The whole thing's grotesque as a gargoyle and ugly as sin.
5024,warcraft-movie,Blake Goble,33,"Jones slaves to make something of the material, and to his credit, or rather his profoundly large cast and crew’s credit, the craft is certainly visible in Warcraft. It feels rude not to compliment the hard work of the makeup, costume, production design, and visual effects teams. "
5025,charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,"Like Roald Dahl's book, Tim Burton's splendidly imaginative and visually stunning - and often very dark and creepy - new version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is squarely aimed more at children than their parents."
5026,jason-x-movie,Gene Seymour,10,"Like a dinner-theater version of the ""Alien"" movies without the good grooming."

5028,sorry-to-bother-you-movie,Ed Gonzalez,63,"For a spell, Boots Riley's cultural ire is so cool-headed that Sorry to Bother You easily distinguishes itself from Mike Judge's similarly themed Idiocracy, but along the way it, too, settles for swinging for the fences—so much so that the target of its satire is no longer in its crosshairs."
5029,we-the-animals-movie,Brent McKnight,88,"Dreamy and impressionistic, interspersed with fantastic bursts of animation, We the Animals plays like a gauzy, mesmerizing, half-remembered experience from childhood."
5030,the-aviator-movie,Joe Morgenstern,70,"Watching the actors and gorgeous trappings is an adventure in cognitive dissonance. I didn't believe a single minute in almost three hours, but enjoyed being there all the same."
5031,amy-2015-movie,Peter Bradshaw,100,"It is an overwhelming story, and despite everyone knowing the ending, it is as gripping as a thriller: Kapadia has fashioned and shaped it with masterly flair."
5032,ghost-ship-movie,Nathan Rabin,30,Likely to appeal only to undiscriminating nudity-- and gore -- starved adolescents.
5033,auto-focus-movie,Ken Fox,70,This ultra-stylish film is far more interested in exploring its own central image -- the camera -- than the forensic minutia of the mystery.
5034,the-village-movie,David Edelstein,30,The photography is excellent! the music is striking! the movie is a stinker!
5035,sketches-of-frank-gehry-movie,Scott Foundas,90,"Sketches was produced for PBS's American Masters series, but it's in theaters now and deserves to be seen on the largest possible screen."
5036,the-aviator-movie,William Arnold,91,"It's not his (Scorsese) best film, but it's his most accessible and most thoroughly entertaining."

5040,the-cook-the-thief-his-wife-her-lover-movie,John Hartl,88,"Greenaway keeps his wits about him. His vision of human evil is as droll as it is unrelenting. Trained as a painter, he can't help making this particular hell look gorgeous. ""The Cook, the Thief, etc."" is, paradoxically, a beautiful, drily witty film about monstrous vulgarity and ugliness. [6 Apr 1990, p.22]"
5041,christmas-with-the-kranks-movie,Peter Debruge,25,Kranks is the type of grim holiday movie that reminds you of all that is noxious and insincere about the Christmas season and then chases it down with a sickly-sweet reversal 
5042,argo-movie,David Edelstein,80,"A marvel of cunning, an irresistible blend of cool realism and Hollywood hokum. "
5043,school-for-scoundrels-movie,Toddy Burton,30,"School for Scoundrels varies between taking itself seriously and not, leaving the viewer alternately confused and disappointed."
5044,trixie-movie,Jonathan Foreman,12,It's so painful to sit through you eventually stop feeling sorry for the floundering cast.
5045,insomnia-movie,Shawn Levy,100,About as good a movie as you could have hoped for. Really good. Hole-in-one good.
5046,the-beat-that-my-heart-skipped-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,30,"Contrivances accrue so thickly that the source seems to be not 1978 Toback, but 1930s Warner Brothers. The film sweats to be up-to-date with ultra-hectic editing, pace, elision, and sangfroid, but they can't verify the pasteboard base."
5047,eye-of-the-beholder-movie,Curtis Morgan,0,"Pretentious, perplexing and plain rock-dumb movie."
5048,the-fantastic-four-movie,Bilge Ebiri,0,"Given the level of talent involved both in front of and behind the camera, nobody should feel much joy — no anti-tentpole schadenfreude or blockbuster-busting righteousness — to discover that the latest Fantastic Four film is a catastrophe"
5049,are-you-here-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,20,"The compelling Draper’s the creation of “Mad Men” mastermind Matthew Weiner, the writer-director of Are You Here. Which begs the question: how could Weiner make, as his debut comedy, a movie as amateurish and off-putting as this one?"
5050,dont-worry-he-wont-get-far-on-foot-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,"It could be a really showy role, but Phoenix is patient, letting the character, and the audience, come to him. It's a journey worth taking."
5051,lucy-movie,Richard Roeper,12,"Besson has always demonstrated the ability to chuckle at the madness of his own material, and he provides some solid laughs from time to time. But these winks do nothing to erase the reality of a plot that becomes unintentionally hilarious."
5052,the-best-of-youth-movie,Michael Fox,80,"Eminently watchable, The Best of Youth nonetheless lacks the devastating emotional gut punch of its obvious inspiration, Visconti's ""Rocco and His Brothers."""

5054,faust-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,100,"It manages to convey a desire for power in abstract terms, divorced from material gain or a need to be admired. What’s more, it manages to do it with energy and a good deal of weird humor."
5055,mrs-parker-and-the-vicious-circle-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is so incredible that witnessing it is reason enough to take a look at this movie.
5056,oceans-movie,Joe Williams,88,"An evolutionary leap forward, a visually exquisite film that doesn't ignore the truths of pollution and predatory survival."

5060,boxing-helena-movie,Kevin Thomas,0,It was probably worth every costly cent for Kim Basinger to get out of doing the dreadful Boxing Helena -- but you have to wonder whatever there was about it that persuaded her to do it in the first place. [3 Sept 1993]
5061,winters-tale-movie,Drew Taylor,0,"The entire movie feels belabored, lumbering from one awful, over-dressed set piece to another. It's wrongheaded, it's horrendous, it's filled with lines of dialogue that are utter howlers, and yet, it's the type of movie that feels so confident that it really is something. It is, in fact, not."
5062,before-night-falls-movie,Peter Brunette,100,"With Before Night Falls, Schnabel has moved to an entirely new plane of cinematic achievement."
5063,about-schmidt-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"A seriously good movie, a challenge to viewers, a rebuke of the way many Americans live their lives."
5064,here-on-earth-movie,Lisa Alspector,10,Neither the love nor the loss in this tear-jerking romance contains much drama.
5065,the-kid-stays-in-the-picture-movie,Jami Bernard,63,"The best part is during the closing credits. Dustin Hoffman does a brilliant, dead-on impression of Evans that captures the essence of the man more than all the self-serving grandiosity that preceded it."
5066,la-la-land-movie,Kimberley Jones,100,"It’s almost criminal to have to stay in your seat when the contact high of La La Land is goosing you to grand jeté in the aisle. The heart, at least, is at liberty to swell to bursting."
5067,south-of-the-border-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Yes, Stone gets cozy with Hugo Chávez, soft-pedaling the Venezuelan president's crackdown tendencies, but he also captures South America in a paradigm shift, wrenching itself free of centuries of colonial control. The film is rose-colored agitprop, but it catches a current of history."
5068,four-brothers-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Four Brothers? Ringling Brothers is more like it, because John Singleton's latest stinks like something the elephants left behind. It's not clear what the film is trying to do, but it seems safe to guess that it's doing it wrong."
5069,frozen-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,Relies far too much on an overdose of gore and a pack of hungry wolves to deliver its chills.
5070,primer-movie,Dennis Lim,100,Primer unites physics and metaphysics in an ingenious guerrilla reinvention of cinematic science fiction.
5071,thirteen-movie,Mike Clark,100,"The most powerful of all recent wayward-youth sagas; indeed, it's tough to recall the last such drama that packed as much emotional clout."
5072,in-this-world-movie,Michael Sragow,88,"Without proclaiming itself a wake-up call for the West, In This World cries out for some new method of achieving international trust. "
5073,a-single-man-movie,Michael Phillips,100,"Some films aren't revelations, exactly, but they burrow so deeply into old truths about love and loss and the mess and thrill of life, they seem new anyway. A Single Man is one such film, one of the best of 2009"
5074,bloody-sunday-movie,Mark Caro,100,"By re-imagining a pivotal, terrible 24 hours, Greengrass has made a must-see film that is timely - and timeless."
5075,zama-movie,Richard Brody,90,The dramatic fusion of physical and administrative power captures nothing less than the bloody forging of modernity.
5076,kung-fu-panda-movie,Tasha Robinson,91,"Yet another celebrity-voiced animal adventure, but it stands out from the crowd of similar films with its lightning wit and whirlwind brio."
5077,state-of-play-movie,Kyle Smith,0,State of Play is bordered by the states of absurdity and cliché.
5078,dracula-pages-from-a-virgins-diary-movie,Wesley Morris,100,"Guy Maddin is a scholar, poet, prankster, and ferociously devoted classicist who likes to resurrect dead cinemas and deader directors and make them vital all over again. "
5079,sex-and-the-city-2-movie,Dana Stevens,10,"And it's true that this movie's absolute tone-deafness, its complete disconnection from our current economic and geopolitical reality, by moments achieves a perverse Warholian profundity."
5080,a-life-less-ordinary-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"The real problem is the movie itself. The plot, with its interlocking contrivances, is like a machine that keeps trapping the actors in its gears. Since they aren't allowed to relate to each other on a simple human level, the spangly back-and-forth chemistry on which a romantic comedy depends is nowhere in sight."
5081,the-odd-life-of-timothy-green-movie,Amy Biancolli,75,"The kid is a charmer, the message is heartfelt - love your kids while you can - and, OK, the ending might jerk a few tears, even from a crank like me. OK, it did."
5082,daughters-of-the-dust-movie,Rita Kempley,100,"In the hands of director Julie Dash and photographer Arthur Jafa, this nonlinear film becomes visual poetry, a wedding of imagery and rhythm that connects oral tradition with the music video. It is an astonishing, vivid portrait not only of a time and place, but of an era's spirit."
5083,searching-for-sugar-man-movie,Peter Hartlaub,100,"""Searching"" has emotional valleys and zeniths, and gasp-inducing turns, as old friends, fans and Rodriguez's grown daughters are interviewed. "

5086,the-great-silence-1968-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,"While the film's masterful imagery — this might be the coldest, snowiest western ever — and inventive Ennio Morricone score are spectacular, less audience friendly is a nihilistic, revisionist denouement that apocalyptically subverts the genre's norms."
5087,left-behind-2014-movie,Gary Goldstein,0,"Cheesy visual effects, flat shooting, slack directing and pacing, risible dialogue and characterization, lots of crummy acting, plus a painfully dull first act make this anything but a rapturous experience."
5088,lost-in-space-movie,John Krewson,10,"Dream up a plot incorporating time travel, genetic mutation, cyberjargon, and saving the Earth -- all the worst and most boring elements of science fiction. Finally, type up a list of bad jokes, space-talk, and semi-tough tag lines; label it ""script."""
5089,the-black-stallion-returns-movie,Staff (Not Credited),10,"The Black Stallion Returns is little more than a contrived, cornball story that most audiences will find to be an interminable bore."

5091,lost-in-la-mancha-movie,Michael Atkinson,30,The movie neither inspires us to pine for what might've been nor makes Gilliam-style filmmaking seem like a noble pursuit.
5092,drop-dead-gorgeous-movie,Ted Gideonse,10,The crude humor in Drop Dead Gorgeous does not have a moral point to it. It's just crude.
5093,the-towering-inferno-movie,David Fear,75,"The story is stock, but thanks to the behind-the-scene fire wranglers, you can practically feel the heat. "
5094,slumdog-millionaire-movie,Michael Sragow,100,Slumdog Millionaire dives headfirst into something greater than a subculture - the enormous unchronicled culture of India's mega-slums - and achieves even more sweeping impact.
5095,the-lucky-ones-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"Cheap, ignorant, tone-deaf and condescending, but what's strangest about it is that it actually thinks it's pro-soldier even as it portrays vets home on leave as foolish (Rachel McAdams), desperate (Tim Robbins) and dishonorable (Michael Pena) while playing all three situations for laughs."
5096,jurassic-world-movie,Ty Burr,63,"Jurassic World is a roadworthy retread, a summer blockbuster that has more than its share of absurdities and bald patches but gets by anyway because dinosaurs."
5097,cheaper-by-the-dozen-2-movie,Rick Groen,25,"Sure ain't a movie. Nope, it's a product, pure and very simple and carefully tested to sell to the widest possible market."
5098,black-knight-movie,Mark Holcomb,10,Suited only for unwitting under-twelvers (though even they may not outlast the midpoint evaporation of Lawrence's shtick).
5099,we-need-to-talk-about-kevin-movie,Ed Gonzalez,38,"The purpose of Lynne Ramsay's hodgepodge approach is to distract us from the flimsiness of a story that suggests a snide art-house take on ""The Omen."""
5100,the-constant-gardener-movie,Anthony Lane,70,"Think about it a day later, though, and its hectic swoop from romance to thriller to campaign manifesto leaves oddly little afterglow. The gardener is the only constant here; so much else burns up and blows away."
5101,a-perfect-getaway-movie,Cliff Doerksen,70,Writer-director David Twohy (Pitch Black) serves up mechanical thrills culminating in a bogus twist ending.
5102,cartel-land-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"If the ambiguity of these stories may frustrate some viewers – we long to be clearly told which of these people are good, if any, and which bad – that is the ambiguity of the world, the ambiguity addressed by Heineman’s Michoacán friend with the bandana and the AK-47."
5103,fast-five-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,It's a movie for audiences who think exuberance in movies is more important than sense or logic and who can laugh at a movie and like it at the same time.
5104,love-the-coopers-movie,Nick Schager,30,"Decked out in the usual tinsel-and-mistletoe trappings, the film lurches awkwardly between gloominess and giddiness, never hitting the boisterously bittersweet groove it seeks."
5105,surviving-picasso-movie,Janet Maslin,80,"Freed from the slavishness of most authorized biography, the film makers try bold strokes."
5106,deepwater-horizon-movie,Leah Greenblatt,83,What works almost disturbingly well is the way Berg calibrates his delivery of the disaster while still holding on to the human scale of it.

5110,the-pick-up-artist-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"This is an appallingly silly movie, from its juvenile comic overture to its dreadfully sincere conclusion."
5111,the-generals-daughter-movie,Rick Groen,38,"To divulge the plot would spoil the experience -- you'll be shocked to discover, and maybe even surprised to learn, just how lame the damn thing really is."
5112,before-sunset-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,100,This is one of the most wildly romantic movies in ages.
5113,love-is-strange-movie,Betsy Sharkey,100,"In the hands of two of the craft's best, the most ordinary of moments become illuminating, penetrating."
5114,the-whole-nine-yards-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,"A convoluted ''dweeb meets the Mob'' farce in which everyone is trying to kill everyone else, but it's the movie that's the real corpse -- albeit a busy, twitching one."
5115,polisse-movie,Scott Tobias,75,"The best moments of Maïwenn's Polisse, about the dedicated members of a Child Protection Unit in northern Paris, have the same quality, a fly-on-the-wall docu-realism that feels eerily like the real thing. "
5116,poetry-movie,Maggie Lee,70,"Not everyone will wax lyrical about this enigmatic and troubling film, which is also Chan-dong's most slow-moving one. But those with an eye for reading between the lines can find layers of meaning."
5117,paddington-movie,Peter Travers,75,"It's funny. So is Nicole Kidman, very Cruella De Vil as Millicent Clyde, a taxidermist with an eye on adding Paddington to her stuffed collection. It's an excuse for some chase scenes and physical comedy (Paddington gets his head stuck in a toilet bowl) that manage to suggest both the Marx brothers and Wes Anderson. I mean that as a good thing."
5118,carnage-2011-movie,Ty Burr,88,"The film's an even four-hander, with awful behavior spread evenly among the characters and spellbinding performances by the quartet of co-leads. "
5119,grosse-pointe-blank-movie,Rita Kempley,90,A hilarious new addition to the wonderfully warped Generation X-Files.
5120,perfect-stranger-movie,Claudia Puig,25,"Superficial and lurid, Perfect Stranger is the cinematic equivalent of spam and should, like those trashy messages, be avoided."
5121,as-i-lay-dying-movie,Wes Greene,63,"James Franco's readiness in approaching famously abstract source material certainly doesn't translate well into his directorial formalism, or, more appropriately, lack of formalism."
5122,jason-goes-to-hell-the-final-friday-movie,Debbie Barra,25,"I admit, I jumped a couple of times in the beginning, but as the movie progressed, it lost its horror and picked up its stupidity. [20 Aug 1993, p.21]"
5123,virtuosity-movie,Michael Wilmington,25,"The usual bad movie sometimes gives a few chuckles, amuses audiences by making them feel superior. But young director Leonard makes a different kind of bomb. Fascinated with technology, Leonard makes cutting-edge techno-turkeys, with wildly elaborate visuals and ridiculous plots. [4 Aug 1995, pg. I]"
5124,vice-2015-movie,Brian Tallerico,25,"Some will dismiss it by saying it’s so ineffective as to never really aggravate critical faculties, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a complete waste of time and talent as well."
5125,guarding-tess-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,"All this is supposed to be as cute as bugs and chock-full of worldly wisdom, but even with lead actors as likable and as resourceful as these, the material made me alternately want to gag and nod off."
5126,city-of-god-movie,Stephen Hunter,100,"It's a trip to Hell and back, and testimony for embittered cynics of all that a movie can be."
5127,kids-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"Ostensibly about the banality of youthful evil, Kids is simply about its own banality. At best, it's a misplaced aesthetic experiment. At worst, it's glossy exploitation—with enough controversy to launch a thousand trite radio and television talk shows."
5128,the-thin-red-line-movie,Norman Green,80,"The Thin Red Line attempts to soar much nearer to the sun than ""Ryan.""  Its imagery aims at our souls. It wrestles with complexity, speaks to us in poetry, weaves multiple narrative strands into a tapestry, opens the festering wounds of war and gazes inside without blinking."
5129,greedy-lying-bastards-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"There was a time when the climate-change alarmist movement was like a guy with a megaphone at your ear, but now it’s more like a squirrel at your shoelaces. "
5130,last-vegas-movie,Peter Keough,25,"Somewhere between John Cassavetes’s “Husbands” (1970) and “The Hangover” (2009) you will find Last Vegas. Not necessarily a bad place to be, except the film unfortunately has the madcap hilarity of the former and the emotional intensity of the latter."
5131,the-polar-express-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"A movie for more than one season; it will become a perennial, shared by the generations. It has a haunting, magical quality because it has imagined its world freshly and played true to it, "
5132,gett-the-trial-of-viviane-amsalem-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,"Remarkably, the film is composed entirely of point-of-view shots. Although she’s in the room, Viviane is not even part of the image during the early minutes of the film."
5133,kumiko-the-treasure-hunter-movie,Josh Larsen,63,"Given Kikuchi’s purposefully distanced performance, Zellner’s tendency to give scenes four lungs full of breathing space, and the often jarring musical choices, it’s almost as if the movie is daring you not to like it."
5134,cop-out-movie,Marc Mohan,0,"Cop Out wouldn't be as disappointing if it hadn't been made by Smith, but for those who dig the vulgar wit of his early, funny films, it's not just stupid, it's sad. At least the worst film of the year also bears its most forgettable title."
5135,a-bigger-splash-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Everything in this movie is so ripe and voluptuous that watching it doesn't seem enough, you want to take a bite out of it."
5136,the-lobster-movie,Michael Nordine,90,"Lanthimos's consistently hilarious, borderline anti-humor slowly gives way to a romantic streak of surprising warmth. "
5137,penguins-of-madagascar-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,"A lazy, noisy ADHD-addled collection of animated clichés guaranteed to give anyone older than 5 a headache, even if you don’t see it in optional 3-D."
5138,like-mike-movie,Michael Dequina,10,There's no excuse to come within a hundred feet of a screen playing this monstrosity of a movie.
5139,black-knight-movie,Shawn Levy,25,"It's fitting that Black Knight, the new time-travel movie with Martin Lawrence, should arrive at the start of the Christmas season, because the season gives us the perfect word to describe it: humbug."
5140,les-cowboys-movie,Christopher Kompanek,88,"Bidegain and cinematographer Arnaud Potier speak multitudes with wide-angle, slow-panning shots that immerse us in a post-9/11 quagmire that’s never less than utterly personal."
5141,trespass-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Cage and director Joel Schumacher, who has fallen so far from the A-list that he provokes a demand for new letters of the alphabet after Z, have each found their cinematic soulmates."

5143,in-the-mood-for-love-movie,Ed Gonzalez,100,In the Mood For Love is ravishing beyond mortal words.
5144,blindspotting-movie,Liam Lacey,83,"Blindspotting is a first film, a busy jumble of thoughts and urgent feelings: The humour is sometimes corny, the surreal fantasies strained and the dramatization of racial privilege unsubtle. Yet the level of ambition here, the commitment to try to say so much, is fresh and exciting."
5145,seraphine-movie,Andrea Gronvall,90,"Provost and cowriter Marc Abdelnour explore the mutable boundaries between spirituality, naivete, genius, and madness, showing how the two outsiders and polar opposites cultivated a mutual understanding."
5146,paterson-movie,Richard Roeper,88,"Paterson is a fable, brimming with symbolism and inside literary references and nods to playwrights and authors from decades and centuries gone by — but it’s also authentic and plausible, in its own weird way."
5147,the-spectacular-now-movie,Matthew Kassel,75,"Thankfully, refreshingly, The Spectacular Now never once feels like a cautionary tale. "
5148,casino-movie,Staff (Not credited),100,Possesses a stylistic boldness and verisimilitude that is virtually matchless.
5149,i-am-michael-movie,Robert Abele,80,"Kelly, who is credited with Stacey Miller for the screenplay, is shrewd enough to keep the movie from being a dramatized op-ed piece about betrayal, instead making roiling uncertainty, loneliness and melancholy the marquee emotions."
5150,o-brother-where-art-thou-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,Why would filmmakers with this much talent work this hard to thumb their noses at everything they put on screen?
5151,the-host-movie,V.A. Musetto,88,A fantastical genre-buster.
5152,the-diabolical-movie,Gary Goldstein,30,"The Diabolical is a tepid horror-thriller that never manages to sell, much less clarify, its potentially ambitious concept. "
5153,ant-man-and-the-wasp-movie,Tasha Robinson,81,"Given how much of the film is spent on watching tiny items grow to improbable size, and huge objects shrink down to the scale of toys, it seems only appropriate that Ant-Man and the Wasp neatly balances its big, serious concerns with its little petty ones. It’s a movie that understands all the variances of scale, and takes the audience along for the ride as they constantly change."
5154,butterfly-kiss-movie,Staff (Not Credited),38,Plummer's fearlessness is awesome -- just try to imagine another actress willing to bare so much bony flesh wrapped in clanking chains -- but her character is nevertheless a ranting bore.
5155,beast-movie,Guy Lodge,80,"Upgrading a sleeping-with-the-enemy premise familiar from countless B-thrillers with a faintly mythic aura and cool psychosexual shading, Beast also sustains a fresh, frank feminine perspective through Jessie Buckley’s remarkable lead performance."
5156,the-station-agent-movie,Megan Lehmann,88,[McCarthy] marries beautifully spare compositions with comically abbreviated dialogue to craft something magnificent from a vaguely precious premise that could easily be the foundation for a parody. 
5157,every-secret-thing-movie,Katherine Pushkar,20,"Diane Lane has about 15 minutes of underwritten screen time as Helen, Alice’s tart, art-teacher mother. A wooden Elizabeth Banks is the detective who cracked the original case and now heads up the new one. She thought she could handle it. She can’t."
5158,masked-and-anonymous-movie,Peter Rainer,10,Here’s a good rule of thumb: Any movie featuring a quote in its ad from the poet laureate of Great Britain—“Deeply engaging!” -- is in trouble.
5159,dirty-grandpa-movie,Nick Schager,0,"This contemptible fiasco is not only comfortable courting laughs through ugly mockery of minorities, but also doesn’t even have the courage of its own crass-as-I-wannabe convictions."
5160,the-bounty-hunter-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,20,This synthetic comedy is instantly grating.
5161,the-battle-of-shaker-heights-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"Brain-numbingly innocuous, cliche-soused melodrama."

5165,space-chimps-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"And then there is the most annoying animated sidekick in a long time: a bulb-headed, trying-to-be-cute glow creature called Kilowatt (Kristen Chenoweth), who sings an ear-piercing, high-pitched note when it's scared, which is often."
5166,a-midsummer-nights-dream-movie,Peter Stack,75,"A playful, sexy piece of work -- just what the Bard might have conjured up for a movie adaptation of his beloved spring-fever comedy."
5167,the-merchant-of-venice-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,Pacino shows you what is only subliminally in the text: that Shylock's heart of stone is really a wall of wounded pride.
5168,beasts-of-no-nation-movie,Ty Burr,88,"The idea that there may be life after war and murder, even for the murderers, and what that might look like — what burdens you might be allowed to put down and what you’ll carry forward forever. The movie’s too wise, and too weary, to have a moral beyond that."
5169,insomnia-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"With Insomnia, his third feature, Nolan, 32, has proven himself a precocious master of the thriller, unsettling the audience with a brief image of blood seeping through fabric."
5170,notes-on-a-scandal-movie,Ruthe Stein,100,"Notes on a Scandal won't be everyone's cup of tea. But if you like your films strong, this one is not to be missed."
5171,the-last-picture-show-movie,Tim Grierson,88,"It's a snapshot of a small Texas town in the 1950s that's ostensibly filled with bighearted, god-fearing real Americans. But this exceedingly sad film spits in the eye of such homespun niceties: This is an Eisenhower-era world riddled with directionless teens, bored housewives and disenfranchised citizens who can't escape the futility around them."
5172,now-in-the-wings-on-a-world-stage-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,"Vanity, thy name is Kevin Spacey."
5173,the-cat-in-the-hat-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"They've taken a classic and they've battered it senseless and, boy, does it stink. It’s so bad it’s amazing it's being released, and box office-goers might soon end up fleeced. And annoyed and bewildered, perhaps even creeped-out by this cacophonous mess which is awful throughout."
5174,millions-movie,Steven Rea,88,Leaves you feeling rich - and richly satisfied.
5175,collateral-beauty-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,0,"Maybe you'll be at a dinner. Maybe nobody will believe you. Or maybe they will, and someone will say, ""Hollywood is terrible at making movies about trauma.”"
5176,titan-ae-movie,Roger Ebert,88,Pure slam-bam space opera.
5177,mystic-river-movie,Glenn Kenny,100,"Perhaps the greatest, most affecting articulation of the theme Eastwood has been exploring since 1990's ""White Hunter Black Heart"": how violence--real violence, not movie violence--perpetrated and experienced, can erode and/or obliterate the human soul."
5178,bel-ami-movie,Eric Kohn,25,Pattinson portrays the monotonous Georges Duroy in two equally dry modes: scowls and smirks.
5179,thelma-louise-movie,Desson Thomson,90,"Unabashed, streamlined entertainment, and you won't hate yourself in the morning for liking it."
5180,legends-of-oz-dorothys-return-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"James Franco, all is forgiven. His woebegotten “Oz: The Great and Powerful’’ is practically a masterpiece compared to this eyeball-gougingly ugly, charm-free animated musical sequel."
5181,winter-passing-movie,Steven Rea,75,"A mopey meditation on family and its dysfunctions, Winter Passing is in fact of more than passing interest."
5182,personal-velocity-three-portraits-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,"A no-frills docu-Dogma plainness, yet Miller lingers on invisible, nearly psychic nuances, leaping into digressions of memory and desire. She boxes these women's souls right open for us."
5183,the-unknown-woman-movie,Ella Taylor,20,Repellent piece of garbage.
5184,upgrade-movie,Barry Hertz,75,"Leigh Whannell’s new film is exactly the kind of pure trash that feels suited to spaces that are dirty, neglected, a little bit worse for wear. But this is no insult. "
5185,taxi-movie,Megan Lehmann,12,This witless action comedy begins to insult the audience's intelligence from the opening scene.
5186,henry-poole-is-here-movie,Ty Burr,25,Manages a fairly rare trick: It's a movie that's both deeply felt and completely phony.
5187,arthur-movie,David Edelstein,0,"In Arthur, the spectacularly grating remake of Steve Gordon's 1981 P. G. Wodehouse simulation (this time, Peter Baynham miswrote, Jason Winer misdirected), Russell Brand gives a career-killing performance."
5188,two-for-the-money-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"Two for the Money, which was written by Dan Gilroy (Freejack, Chasers), is so badly constructed and illogical that its inanities manage to drown the actor (Pacino) out."
5189,maxed-out-hard-times-easy-credit-and-the-era-of-predatory-lenders-movie,Kevin Crust,80,Scurlock does well to counter the more dire aspects of the film with a razor-sharp sense of humor.
5190,company-man-movie,J. Hoberman,10,Bracingly unfunny.
5191,cloverfield-movie,Steven Rea,63,"Much scampering, yelling, quaking and crying is required of the actors, and they acquit themselves well enough, even with oozing fake wounds and prop rebars piercing their shoulder blades."
5192,uss-indianapolis-men-of-courage-movie,Neil Genzlinger,30,"The film, directed by Mario Van Peebles, brays the story in broad strokes and clichés as if the horror of it didn’t speak for itself, which it most certainly does."
5193,dumb-and-dumber-to-movie,Claudia Puig,25,"If there was any doubt that most things in society have been dumbed down in the last couple of decades, Dumb and Dumber To could be exhibit A."
5194,bowfinger-movie,Carrie Rickey,100,Spoofy and sweet... endearingly old-fashioned.
5195,girl-interrupted-movie,Sarah Raskin,80,"Despite uneven pacing -- Girl, Interrupted deftly collapses then and now to create a very personal film filled with heart-tugs and surprisingly funny moments."
5196,bad-education-movie,Phil Hall,10,Such garbage that taking a shower at the Bates Motel is a more appealing alternative.
5197,loser-movie,John Hartl,20,In short: Don't expect a lot of laughs.
5198,mighty-morphin-power-rangers-the-movie-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"There's an appeal here, for sure, but if you're not 8 years old you may never figure it out."
5199,girl-most-likely-movie,Claudia Puig,38,A failure from start to finish.
5200,annie-2014-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,"The worst Hollywood musical so far this century, it’s another misstep for Sony Pictures, which also sponsored the abortive ‘‘The Interview.’’"
5201,rebound-movie,Ann Hornaday,10,"Why -- when there are so many funnier, smarter, more gifted performers who can't get arrested in Hollywood -- why, for the love of all that's good and holy, does Martin Lawrence get to keep making movies?"
5202,company-man-movie,Cody Clark,20,"If Company Man were a wreck on the interstate, it would involve multiple cars and at least one jackknifed tanker truck, and traffic would be backed up for miles as passing motorists slow to gawk."
5203,trollhunter-movie,Chris Cabin,38,"Injecting some down time to intimate a vast internal life is one thing, but needlessly approximating patches of wasted time is another, and Trollhunter's dully drawn characters suggest that the latter is closer to what André Øvredal came up with."
5204,that-thing-you-do!-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"That Thing You Do! is neither overly sentimental nor overly cynical. It looks at the invention of our pop-rock mythology, and the bands that fed it until they were consumed by it, just as you'd expect Tom Hanks to: with open eyes (and a raised eyebrow)."
5205,untitled-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"The movie (Untitled) is a tinny satire destined to go ""(Unwatched)"" because it is ""(Uninteresting)."""
5206,ant-man-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"I wish the film had gone even further into loopiness. Like Ant-Man, the film, directed by Peyton Reed, comes in two sizes  – it’s sometimes big on laughs but often small on risk-taking."
5207,norbit-movie,Luke Sader,20,"Racially insensitive, politically incorrect and beyond crude."
5208,van-wilder-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,10,The movie is really just an elaborate excuse to show repeated close-ups of an elephantine dog scrotum.
5209,jaws-the-revenge-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"There's more suspense in On Golden Pond. And when the predictable ending comes, it has none of the titanic man-versus-beast struggle of the original. It all happens so quickly, you wonder if you've missed something. But, no you haven't, because there it is -- the familiar calm sea . . . of credits."
5210,midnight-express-movie,Gary Arnold,30,"Midnight Express is an outrageously sensationalistic movie version of a non-fiction cautionary tale, Billy Hays' account of his imprisonment in Turkey after being convicted for drug smuggling. Parker has upset the book's delicate sense of balance. He uses Hays' dilemma as a springboard for sensationalism, especially sustained depictions of brutality and hysteria. Midnight Express sets a new standard in shamelessness. [28 Oct 1978, p.B6]"
5211,red-hill-movie,Robert Abele,70,Commendably entertaining. 
5212,ace-ventura-pet-detective-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"I found the movie a long, unfunny slog through an impenetrable plot. Kids might like it."
5213,the-counselor-movie,Bill Weber,63,"The film doesn't temper enough of Cormac McCarthy's excesses, but Ridley Scott and his ensemble find enough meat in his scenario to make for diverting, bloody pleasure."
5214,welcome-to-mooseport-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,"Set against ""Mooseport's"" backdrop of ramped-up whimsy -- and not the kind that charms, either, but the kind that gets old faster than uncovered cheese -- Romano just kind of disappears. "
5215,the-naked-gun-from-the-files-of-police-squad!-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"Crass, broad, irreverent, wacky fun - and absolutely hilarious from beginning to end."
5216,scary-movie-5-movie,Leah Churner,0,"SM5 tanked opening weekend, which may toll the knell for this property."
5217,gembaku-no-ko-movie,V.A. Musetto,88,"With Japan facing a new nuclear crisis, this beautifully composed and acted heart-wrencher -- couldn't be more timely."
5218,snow-angels-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"Frankly, Snow Angels is a downer. This isn't inherently a negative - after all, some of the cinema's most powerful motion pictures are downbeat. However, in this case, there's no emotional force behind all the gloom - just a sense that something's missing."
5219,land-of-the-dead-movie,David Edelstein,90,"As the ghouls evolve toward humanity and the humans toward ghouldom, we can appreciate Romero for using horror to show us How We Live Now, and How We're Living Dead now, too."
5220,uptown-girls-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,"A creepy, depressing and leering ""comedy"" that's a virtual collection of ""What were they thinking?"" moments."
5221,the-seventh-son-movie,Drew McWeeny,0,"It is a staggeringly bad film, made up of lots of faulty pieces. "
5222,the-hero-of-color-city-movie,Ed Gonzalez,12,No cartoon has ever conveyed the struggle for self-actualization with such an inexpressive sense of imagination as this cheap and glorified babysitter.
5223,planet-51-movie,Ty Burr,38,Young children and adults with high pain thresholds will enjoy the movie during its brief pause on the way to your On Demand menu.
5224,the-secret-of-the-grain-movie,Wesley Morris,100,"Takes one man, his children, their spouses and babies, his ex-wife, his girlfriend, her daughter, and his friends and turns it all into a masterpiece about the strange power of food - to heal, unite, exasperate."
5225,the-nomi-song-movie,Marc Savlov,78,"Thankfully, The Nomi Song should go a long way toward re-cementing this striking creature's legendary status."
5226,twelve-years-a-slave-movie,David Denby,100,12 Years a Slave is easily the greatest feature film ever made about American slavery. 
5227,crude-movie,Mike Scott,75,"Part eco-doc,  part legal-doc,  it is a troubling,  real story  --  and a well-told one at that  --  that is inspiring and infuriating all at once."
5228,the-princess-diaries-2-royal-engagement-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,There's not enough story in it to fill a shoebox.
5229,marci-x-movie,Joe Leydon,30,Plays like an overextended variety-show sketch. 
5230,vicky-cristina-barcelona-movie,Dan Zak,80,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona is beautiful because Allen is now decidedly in control of this phase of his career, which blends the sharpness of his older dramas with a newly acquired expatriate hipness."
5231,saving-mr-banks-movie,David Edelstein,30,"A fair number of people have responded with tears and laughs to Saving Mr. Banks, but I found it interminable. "
5232,pixels-movie,Roy Graham,0,"As a bad movie, Pixels is extremely dismissible. The ways in which it is bad are hardly fun to pick apart, a la ""The Room;"" instead, they're just banal — the deeply predictable plot, the unfunny jokes, the constant low-level sexism and occasional spikes of racism that permeate the story."
5233,who-framed-roger-rabbit-movie,Desson Thomson,100,"If you don’t like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, have your pulse checked... You'll forget yourself right through to the end when Porky Pig, dressed as a cop, says ""M-move along, there's n-nothing more to s-see folks.""  [24 June 1988]"
5234,body-double-movie,Robbie Collin,90,"Body Double isn’t trash, misogynistic or otherwise. It’s unrepentantly trashy – not the kind of film you watch while your parents or kids are in the house, or with your curtains open. But it’s also a complex, provocative suspense thriller that bears comparison with the three immaculate Hitchcock classics – Vertigo, Psycho and Rear Window – it gleefully drags through the sludge. "
5235,everly-movie,Amy Nicholson,70,"Everly has the heaving, bloody bosoms of an exploitation flick, yet Hayek gives the character powerful dignity. She's no victim, nor an off-the-shelf ""strong woman."""
5236,zoolander-2-movie,Steve Davis,20,The movie is as lifeless as a mannequin until Ferrell appears near the end as the absurdly coiffed villain Jacobim Mugatu.
5237,van-helsing-movie,David Sterritt,25,"In sum, Van Helsing is yet another video game disguised as a wide-screen epic. Here's hoping the box office drives a firm wooden stake through its hokey Hollywood heart."
5238,killing-gunther-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"Unfortunately, Schwarzenegger doesn’t show up until more than an hour into this relentlessly unfunny comedy and by then viewers may have tuned out long before."
5239,paprika-movie,John Anderson,90,Kon's best work yet.
5240,lost-souls-movie,Wesley Morris,0,"Another ""Exorcist"" bastard -- one with a chick-flick pedigree."
5241,happythankyoumoreplease-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Isn't quite insipid, although if it were a little better, it could be."
5242,hannah-montana-the-movie-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"Cyrus, as always, is a professional charmer (it's hard to resist when she leads a hip-hop hoedown), and the crusty folkiness of Billy Ray Cyrus as her real-life dad is as welcome as ever."
5243,gigli-movie,Kevin Carr,10,It’s just a mess.
5244,the-crew-movie,Chuck Wilson,20,There are moments that suggest the comedy that could have been.
5245,you-will-meet-a-tall-dark-stranger-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,38,"It's a highbrow romantic farce, without the laughs."
5246,the-beatles-eight-days-a-week---the-touring-years-movie,Peter Travers,75,The documentary rightly keeps coming back to the music and the band's delight in making it. Good move. It truly is a joy forever.
5247,caddyshack-movie,Judy Stone,0,"Unreconstructed fans of Chevy Chas, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight or Bill Murray might find something to guffaw at in this lamebrained movie that purports to be a satire on country club life but makes everybody look like slobs. Except - perhaps - a little Irish wench named Sarah Holcomb and the gopher who tears up the golf course. Should have put the gopher to work on the script."
5248,kung-fu-hustle-movie,Andrew Sun,100,"With a delirious mix of the sublime and the silly, Hong Kong comedy king Stephen Chow Sing-chi has taken the kung fu comedy genre to new heights of chop-socky hilarity."
5249,elektra-movie,Kim Morgan,30,"When a movie makes you wish you were watching Halle Berry in ""Catwoman,"" something is most definitely wrong."
5250,grizzly-man-movie,Allison Benedikt,75,"The movie here is Treadwell's footage--some of it beautiful, much of it difficult to watch."
5251,defiance-movie,Gene Newman,88,"The perfect antidote to the post-holiday blues. It's exciting, well-acted, touching, and genuine."
5252,to-die-for-movie,Kathy Fennessey,90,"Van Sant and crew appear to have had a blast making this film, and I had a blast watching it. The subject matter is very dark and yet it is handled with a very light touch."
5253,horrible-bosses-2-movie,Tom Russo,63,A new misadventure whose negligibly refined formula somehow ends up being more consistently entertaining.
5254,before-sunrise-movie,James Berardinelli,100,"Before Sunrise speaks as much to the mind as to the heart, and much of what it says is likely to strike a responsive chord -- a rare and special accomplishment for any motion picture."
5255,a-bigger-splash-movie,Zhuo-Ning Su,83,"Realized with extraordinary craft and verve even if insufficiently contextualized, A Bigger Splash might not have achieved the desired impact, but the wicked spell it casts remains a bona-fide stunner."
5256,streets-of-fire-movie,Bill Cosford,63,"What goes on in Streets of Fire is not quite stupid -- it's saved from that by the remarkable love for style of its director, Walter Hill -- but the film doesn't show an intelligence to match its style, either. [04 June 1984, p.C6]"
5257,hot-pursuit-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,80,"Hot Pursuit is a quiet triumph of tone and timing. Nearly every scene is cut at just the right point, often topped off with a fantastic kicker of dialogue. "
5258,star-wars-episode-v---the-empire-strikes-back-movie,Gene Siskel,100,"It balances bloodshed with charm, spectacle with childlike glee. It's a near flawless movie of its kind."
5259,into-the-forest-movie,Peter Travers,63,Rozema's minimalist approach pays dividends until a final third hobbled by overdone effects and a thrashing musical score. Too bad. The story being told on the faces of Page and Wood had eloquence and power enough to hold us rapt. 
5260,assassins-creed-movie,Michael Phillips,25,"It's just a mediocre action movie, poorly edited and larded with a terrible musical score, based on a video game. Nothing new there."
5261,meet-the-robinsons-movie,Peter Debruge,38,"The characters, starting with Lewis himself, are downright obnoxious. Not counting those singing frogs or the time-traveling T. rex (with its big head and little arms), only Lewis' sad-sack roommate ''Goob'' is remotely sympathetic."
5262,the-second-mother-movie,Stephanie Merry,88,The Second Mother feels lovingly handcrafted. All the elements of the story fit impeccably together for a humorous and occasionally wrenching examination of relationships.
5263,iron-man-3-movie,Joe Neumaier,80,It sharply fuses the humor and heart of the earlier films with a satisfyingly heavy-metal strength — and a darkness that’s more than earned.
5264,the-roommate-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,It's only February but I can already name the year's winner of Most Thoughtless Gay Stereotype in Film award. The dubious honor goes to The Roommate.
5265,youth-movie,Jake Cole,38,"As ever, Paolo Sorrentino ironically cuts the legs out from under his protagonists' wistfulness with grotesquerie.  "
5266,micmacs-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Highly visual but cold. It's undeniably inventive, but also relentlessly fey and self-consciously zany and, in terms of story, it moves with audacious slowness."
5267,the-big-bounce-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"Go in with lowered expectations, and expect to have them dashed."
5268,the-woman-in-black-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"The production company is Hammer Films, a venerable name in British horror. Responsible for some of the best monster movies of the '50s and '60s, when Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee were a favorite team, Hammer has endured over the years. Now, as then, the Hammer name is an assurance that terror, not soulless special effects, lies at the heart of the production. The Woman in Black bears this out. "
5269,the-city-of-lost-children-movie,Staff (Not Credited),88,You may end up wishing for a little less show and a lot more substance.
5270,the-ringer-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,The surprise of The Ringer is that the movie is pretty damn funny.
5271,borat-cultural-learnings-of-america-for-make-benefit-glorious-nation-of-kazakhstan-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"Not since the halcyon days of Archie Bunker and ""All in the Family"" has so sharp a wit punctured so many balloons."
5272,the-idiots-movie,Dana Stevens,10,"Has nothing on its mind besides the squirming discomfort of its audience, the achievement of which it holds up as a brave political accomplishment."
5273,the-warren-files-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"An uncommonly intense and frightening experience, The Conjuring is the first genuinely scary release in ages by a major studio that features practically no violence and spills only a bit of blood. "
5274,devils-due-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,30,Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett direct with competence but a dispiriting lack of originality.
5275,paddington-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"There are so many terrific things going on in the film – rapid-fire wordplay, split-second visual gags, and some veddy, veddy British punning – that, frankly, Paddington deserves more than one viewing. Huzzah Paddington, and marmalade forever!"
5276,letters-from-iwo-jima-movie,Michael Phillips,100,"The word masterpiece costs nothing to write and means less than nothing in an age when every third picture and each new Clint Eastwood project is proclaimed as such. After two viewings, however, Letters From Iwo Jima strikes me as the peak achievement in Eastwood's hallowed career."
5277,groove-movie,A.O. Scott,70,The film's seductive lack of pretension will make a fan of you.
5278,mystic-river-movie,Jami Bernard,88,"The white-knuckle center of the movie is Sean Penn, who gives an utterly raw performance as Jimmy, father of the dead girl. It's one of the few times that a parent's grief has felt real on the screen through all its ugly permutations."
5279,the-rocketeer-movie,Marc Savlov,78,The Rocketeer is a gung-ho all-American summer flick with the guts not to try and be anything else.
5280,the-night-before-movie,Brian Tallerico,63,"The Night Before is a well-intentioned comedy with some big laughs and some big misfires, but it ultimately works because Rogen and his well-cast buddies ground it in a way that makes them likable. A killer Michael Shannon supporting performance never hurts either."
5281,the-producers-movie,Richard Schickel,70,There's no attempt to address the show's endemic weak spots--a slow start and a contrived end. Mostly Stroman just lets it rip. But in some respects the movie is an improvement on the show.
5282,abduction-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Actual abduction may be preferable to the movie of the same name, but only if your kidnappers don't torture you by forcing you to watch it."
5283,vampires-suck-movie,Nick Pinkerton,10,Smart money says Friedberg and Seltzer never sit through these movies in entirety.
5284,the-astronaut-farmer-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,A piece of mythmaking stupidity.
5285,the-lego-batman-movie-movie,Alonso Duralde,85,"The Lego Batman Movie, for the most part, very skillfully keeps the wackiness from overwhelming the plot and vice versa. And while the various Bat-vehicles take us through vertiginous zooms on land or through the air, McKay keeps the action rousing but never jumbled."
5286,lethal-weapon-3-movie,Jeff Shannon,75,"This colossus may be mechanized, but it's gloriously efficient. The stakes get higher with each installment, and Donner knows how to corral the show-stopping mayhem into a polished, antiseptically entertaining package. [15 May 1992, p.3]"
5287,black-butterfly-movie,Derek Smith,12,Its incoherent turn of events attempts to stupefy us into mistaking its deeply flawed internal logic for ingenuity.
5288,nacho-libre-movie,Manohla Dargis,80,Endearingly ridiculous.
5289,my-kid-could-paint-that-movie,Shawn Levy,83,The result is a true conundrum: You can't say for sure if a scam is in play or if a genuine genius is being smeared. And the brilliance of the film is that it doesn't let you feel secure in choosing either side.
5290,all-the-queens-men-movie,A.O. Scott,20,Rarely has a movie worked so hard to be so inconsequential.
5291,house-of-d-movie,Allison Benedikt,12,"The fatal flaw in David Duchovny's big-screen directorial debut, House of D, is not Robin Williams as a retarded janitor. It's David Duchovny, the man who chose to cast Robin Williams as a retarded janitor."
5292,darkness-falls-movie,Alex Pappademas ,10,This is horror-flick boo-ya at its most rote.
5293,come-early-morning-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"Adams has a good camera eye and a fine feeling for the regional mores of the South, where she's from. Judd, who for a change isn't being terrorized in a thriller, is more nuanced and intense than she's ever been."
5294,stomp-the-yard-movie,Wesley Morris,63,"For his part, Short, another pop choreographer, sounds like Vin Diesel, but he moves like a bee. When he dances, he makes sure every girl in the theater goes home stung."
5295,get-shorty-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"With Get Shorty, Sonnenfeld has shown that broad appeal doesn't necessarily equate with stupidity. That's a lesson Hollywood should learn."
5296,home-sweet-hell-movie,Jon Frosch,10,"The kind of blithely confident, creatively impoverished dud that leaves you slightly stunned someone greenlit it, the movie has the distinction of feeling like a bad idea from its very first frames."
5297,pitch-black-movie,Bob Graham,0,"This half-baked sci-fi horror film, filled with jerky, washed-out, highlighted, blurred and toned imagery, is a tiresome experience."
5298,just-married-movie,Laura Sinagra,10,"Unlike Reese Wither-your-spoon, stagy Murphy actually does deserve her own ""Philadelphia Story,"" or ""Singin' in the Rain."" She's obviously a camp genius (see ""Clueless,"" not ""8 Mile""), but this dopey script, topped with too-pretty Kutcher's rote 70's Show blowups, ain't it."
5299,gabrielle-2014-movie,Jamie S. Rich,83,"Gabrielle borders on the manipulative, but Archambault’s refusal to shy away from the tougher questions the narrative raises keeps it from being swallowed by its own sentimentality."
5300,fuck-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,70,"If you're wondering how Steve Anderson managed to make a 93-minute documentary about the ultimate four-letter word, which uses the epithet over 800 times, you're underestimating his capacity to entertain and educate in roughly equal doses."
5301,urban-legends-final-cut-movie,David Chute,20,Has promising raw material to burn--and that's pretty much what's been done.
5302,ratatouille-movie,Scott Foundas,90,Ratatouille is as much a feast for the senses as it is food for thought.
5303,the-identical-movie,Alonso Duralde,0,"Credit must be given: run-of-the-mill mediocrities come and go, but The Identical is the most woozily misguided flop to grace the screen since the “Oogieloves” movie. Connoisseurs of the most wonderfully terrible cinema need to run out and catch this one early and often."
5304,the-hunt-movie,Jessica Kiang,91,"For anyone with even a halfway developed sense of justice The Hunt may prove stressful, frustrating, even enraging, but it’s also an unbelievably effective watch, that, if nothing else signals an undeniable return to form for Vinterberg, and yet another blistering performance from Mikkelsen. See it, if only for the debates it will cause afterward."
5305,dungeons-dragons-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,10,Maybe I should let a role of the dice determine whether I use a cudgel or a broadsword to put this puppy out of its misery.
5306,love-in-the-time-of-money-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,30,"What keeps Love in the Time of Money from being truly awful is the fact that the actors give it their all -- they may be in contrived situations, but by golly they'll make the best of them."
5307,the-naked-gun-212-the-smell-of-fear-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,A feeble sequel to The Naked Gun that's about one and a half rungs down from its predecessor and a good four or five down from Airplane!
5308,play-it-to-the-bone-movie,Dennis Lim,10,"The journey is a yawn -- an outpouring of backstory, punctuated by cute episodic diversions and ill-advised running gags."
5309,the-golden-compass-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,The final sad joke is this: Weitz took a wonderful story about the danger of severing a soul from its otherwise empty body and did that very thing to his source.
5310,the-kid-movie,Todd McCarthy,20,Director Jon Turteltaub's insistence upon hammering every point home with giant closeups and relentless musical underlining makes this insufferably cloying and sickly sweet.
5311,the-whole-truth-movie,Rex Reed,0,"A guaranteed cure for insomnia, an abomination called The Whole Truth is a courtroom movie that looks like a colorized version of an old Perry Mason TV show, starring Renée Zellweger’s new face and Keanu Reeves, who has the charisma and animated visual appeal of a mud fence."
5312,gods-and-monsters-movie,Kevin Maynard,90,"A profoundly moving human drama, a quasi love story about two lost men who form an unlikely friendship."
5313,riding-in-cars-with-boys-movie,Edward Guthmann,25,"They try to make Beverly adorable, and the movie comes off strained and dishonest as a result."
5314,exodus-gods-and-kings-movie,Marc Savlov,67,"Exodus is an entertainment of the first order. I’m not so sure about the filmmaker’s decision to render the Metatron archangel as a 9-year-old boy, but what the hell? You get hit on the head with a boulder, who knows what you’ll see?"
5315,bright-movie,Rodrigo Perez,0,"Bright tries to create a unique and dynamic world with the juxtaposition of harsh police life, crime and modern life contrasted with this imaginary magical realm, but it’s contrived, unconvincing and most of all calamitously preposterous."
5316,hollow-man-movie,Richard Corliss,10,"Too many special effects, many of them stomach churning; too much pornographically arranged death."
5317,jackie-movie,Jessica Kiang,91,"Jackie is what happens when two distinct sensibilities — the Goliath of the Hollywood prestige pic and the David of Pablo Larraín’s playful, idiosyncratic intelligence — throw down."
5318,blue-is-the-warmest-color-movie,Liam Lacey,88,"The winner of Cannes’s top prize, the Palme d’Or, and the international critics prize at the same festival, the film was hailed as a breakthrough, a graphic and emotional love story, the first same-sex feature ever to win the Palme, in the week after France legalized same-sex marriage."
5319,a-haunted-house-movie,Mark Olsen,10,"No-holds-barred comedy is one thing, hurtful thoughtlessness is something else entirely. An ostensible comedy shouldn't have so many moments that feel so ugly."
5320,life-of-pi-movie,Olly Richards,100,"To produce a coherent film from Martel's tricky novel would be achievement enough, but Ang Lee has extracted something beautiful, wise and, at times, miraculous. "
5321,one-last-kiss-movie,Keith Phipps,30,"Through it all, Muccino piles on one shrill confrontation after another. At times, he seems headed for the melodramatic turf owned and operated by Pedro Almodóvar, but where the young Almodóvar would have deployed a prankish wit and the older Almodóvar scraped toward the humanity beneath."
5322,love-story-movie,Vincent Canby,90,"It looks to be clean and pure and without artifice, even though it is possibly as sophisticated as any commercial American movie ever made."
5323,guarding-tess-movie,Terrence Rafferty,10,"It's a dull, poky picture, which provides an unwelcome showcase for MacLaine's increasingly insufferable cute-gorgon shtick and no showcase at all for Cage's tremendous comic talents."
5324,the-guardian-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,83,The Guardian is that rarest of cinematic commodities: an action movie displaying brains and heart and the opportunity for its stars to do something more than keep the narrative flowing between explosions.
5325,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,Lawrence Toppman,12,"It's bombastic, chaotic, plodding, visually dreary and patchily written."
5326,harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-i-movie,Justin Chang,70,"Director David Yates spins the series' most expansive, structurally free-form chapter yet -- lumbering and gripping by turns, and suffused with a profound sense of solitude and loss."
5327,pride-prejudice-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,100,"Blissful, blazingly intelligent adaptation."
5328,le-week-end-movie,Gabe Toro,91,Michell’s handling of the relationship between the two is touching in how little judgment he passes.
5329,standing-in-the-shadows-of-motown-movie,Ann Hornaday,70,"The film is a testament to art, life and survival like the similar but superior ""Buena Vista Social Club."""
5330,logan-2017-movie,Peter Hartlaub,100,"Logan takes its indestructible metal claws to comic book movie norms and destroys them, and it’s a wonderful thing."
5331,encino-man-movie,Owen Gleiberman,33,"Pauly Shore, the reptilian imp from MTV. Reeling off Valley Dude slang in a slurry monotone, as if he could barely be bothered to make his lips form words, he’s a fey sleazebag in hippie duds — a cross between Jim Morrison and Richard Simmons. The most interesting thing about watching Pauly Shore is wondering how long it will be before he has to take a day job."
5332,whiplash-movie,Calvin Wilson,100,"In a stunning performance, Teller resists the impulse to sugarcoat Andrew’s egocentricity. Simmons is equally impressive, lending Fletcher just enough humanity to render his monstrousness all the more shocking."
5333,our-family-wedding-movie,Nathan Rabin,16,"We remain a nation divided, but hopefully we’ve at least progressed beyond the need for clumsy message movies about racial tolerance, as fortified with dick jokes."
5334,the-eclipse-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,What holds The Eclipse together is Hinds' sorrowful and moving performance as a man haunted in more ways than one.
5335,hell-or-high-water-movie,Bernard Boo,90,"Pulpy, old-fashioned Western action and terrific performances make Hell or High Water one of the most satisfying releases of the summer."
5336,blue-valentine-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,Blue Valentine is lushly touching and gorgeously told.
5337,before-i-go-to-sleep-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Rowan Joffe directed from his own adaptation of a novel by S.J. Watson. If you’re thinking of seeing this turgid turkey, forget it."
5338,hell-or-high-water-movie,Peter Sobczynski,63,"While moviegoers desperate to see anything that doesn’t involve a superhero may be willing to overlook its shortcomings, others will undoubtedly be disappointed to find that it's somewhat less than the sum of its parts."
5339,transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-movie,Peter Rainer,16,"An impossibly, incomprehensibly overlong and cacophonous bore."
5340,quills-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,A stunningly impassioned and articulate study of a writer's life and the censorial demons that can strangle that voice.
5341,cop-land-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"Casting is everything, and the casting of Stallone -- playing way against type -- as the powerless hayseed sheriff in Cop Land is nothing short of inspired."
5342,scream-2-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"Paradoxically, there's a lot less gore. There is blood, of course, but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards, and there are no depictions of spilled entrails. Craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids."
5343,lullaby-movie,Rex Reed,63,"Despite the work of a first-rate cast, it doesn’t feel real to me."
5344,notorious-movie,Andrea Gronvall,80,"Engrossing biopic, throbbing with style and attitude."
5345,88minutes-movie,Marc Savlov,20,"Attica! Attica! Everyone involved in the creation of this muddled, joyless, and deadly dull serial killer-meets-forensic psychiatrist snoozefest should be forced to spend – at the very least – 88 minutes behind Attica's bars."
5346,the-adventures-of-robin-hood-re-release-movie,Shawn Levy,75,"Is it a silly movie? At times, yes. Is it creaky and blatant and obvious? Quite often, absolutely. But should you miss it in this splendidly colorful restoration? Not on your life. "
5347,the-master-of-disguise-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,"An awful, stillborn comedy assembled out of rusty spare parts from secret agent movies and run-of-the-mill ''Saturday Night Live'' skits."
5348,lucky-numbers-movie,Marc Savlov,0,Painfully lame and hamstrung by a viciously unfunny sense of humor.
5349,slow-west-movie,Tasha Robinson,80,"Slow West often feels like the Coen brothers’ rendition of True Grit, if they’d brought Wes Anderson in as a collaborator. It’s a shaggy-dog story full of colorful characters and aimless but diverting narrative byways, all delivered with Andersonian solemnity, against a backdrop of deeply saturated colors and meticulously dressed sets. "
5350,kingsman-the-secret-service-movie,Scott Collura,90,Kingsman: The Secret Service is a spy movie made by James Bond devotees who know the genre so well that they can have a good time with it while also paying it respect -- and taking it to someplace new entirely.
5351,new-york-minute-movie,Carrie Rickey,38,"Plays like ""Sixteen Candles"" meets ""Beetlejuice."" Yet for all the film's frantic pace, this plot plods, even for 'tweens at whom this suburban-girls-take-Manhattan fantasy is obviously targeted."
5352,runaway-bride-movie,Ernest Hardy,0,"Atrocious bit of by-the-numbers screen filler. And anyone who easily lapses into sugar comas is advised to stay far, far away."
5353,going-upriver-the-long-war-of-john-kerry-movie,William Arnold,83,"It's a partisan campaign film, of course, but a subtle one."
5354,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,Anthony Lane,70,"By temperament, Abrams is more of a Spielbergian than he is a Lucasite. His visual wit may not be, as it is for Spielberg, a near-magical reflex, but nor is Abrams suckered into bombast by technological zeal, as Lucas has been, and the new movie, as an act of pure storytelling, streams by with fluency and zip. To sum up: “Star Wars” was broke, and it did need fixing. And here is the answer."
5355,the-wash-movie,Russell Smith,11,"Next time, Pooh, why not do the work it takes and give your drowsy-eyed meal tickets some of the (as it were) good shit?"
5356,we-dont-live-here-anymore-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"A movie for adults, of a kind that usually isn't made in America,"
5357,brake-movie,Andrew Schenker,12,"Until its pair of ludicrous twist endings, which complicates its message and logistics in ways that make little sense, Gabe Torres's Brake plays like a more simplistic version of Buried tailored specifically to a hawkish right-wing crowd. "
5358,the-beverly-hillbillies-movie,Jonathan Shade,20,"The Beverly Hillbillies turns into possibly one of the worst transitions ever. With a cast full of nobodies (who are nobodies for good reason, except Eleniak and that's for her breasts) and an uninspired script the whole film is a considerably patchy affair."
5359,max-movie,Nathan Rabin,30,"Quirky, unsatisfying portrait."
5360,the-turin-horse-movie,Mark Feeney,88,"The Turin Horse is in a very gray black and white. It looks the same way it feels: bleak, pure, forbidding, transfixing. Watching it, frankly, can be a bit of an ordeal. There's hardly anything in The Turin Horse you would describe as entertaining, but there is a very great deal that's beautiful and absorbing."
5361,blue-is-the-warmest-color-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,100,"Kechiche and his actresses explore the in-between—ecstasy, exploration, the comfort and eventual boredom of domesticity—and the aftermath, the painful shards of feeling we cling to after something has shattered. And they don't mess around when it comes to the ferocity of love, sex, or, God help us, the two combined."
5362,dr-strangelove-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,100,Kubrick's comic gem sparkles with enduring relevance.
5363,dumb-and-dumber-to-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"This is anti-funny, where every attempt at a joke is like a little rock thrown at your face. "
5364,exiled-movie,Noel Murray,83,"Nothing about Exiled is as resonant as To's best work, but it's a clever homage to Sam Peckinpah, right down to the clouds of bloody mist that fill the barroom as To's anti-heroes make their last stand."
5365,the-crazies-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"Has warmed-over chills and a muddled, zombie-like execution."
5366,the-ugly-truth-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,"Until that final, inevitable kiss, we have to listen to them, and the clatter of their crude, brainless exchanges is unbearable."
5367,seems-like-old-times-movie,Noel Murray,90,Seems Like Old Times is some of the best work that all of these people ever did on film.
5368,5-broken-cameras-movie,Philip Kemp,100,"A hugely powerful, moving study of a small village's stand against overwhelming state power. Despite all the suffering and injustice, the final message is one of optimism that feels neither facile nor tacked-on."
5369,victoria-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"This terrifying, seductive and adrenaline-fueled movie has found a new form of freedom for cinema."
5370,lone-survivor-movie,Chris Nashawaty,67,Berg has made a powerful film and an important reminder of what really happens when we send men and women off to war. It's just too bad that subtlety isn't a stronger weapon in his arsenal.
5371,mystic-river-movie,David Denby,100,"As close as we are likely to come on the screen to the spirit of Greek tragedy (and closer, I think, than Arthur Miller has come on the stage). The crime of child abuse becomes a curse that determines the pattern of events in the next generation.  [13 October 2003, p. 112]"
5372,testament-of-youth-movie,Leslie Felperin,90,"Striking an elegantly sustained balance between intimacy and historical scope, director James Kent's WWI-set epic Testament of Youth encompasses nearly all of the virtues of classical British period drama and nearly none of the vices. "
5373,oculus-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,The result: a dangerously cracked creep flick.
5374,room-237-movie,Roger Moore,75,"The documentary Room 237 is an ostensibly thoughtful deep reading, a deconstruction of Stanley Kubrick’s film of Stephen King’s 1980 novel “The Shining.” What it really is, is a bunch of obsessives obsessing about an obsessive movie maker’s obsessive movie."
5375,toy-story-3-movie,Peter Rainer,100,"Toy Story 3, has more emotional power than either of its predecessors. Come to think of it, it also has more emotional power than most of the live-action movies out there."
5376,the-forgiveness-of-blood-movie,Ernest Hardy,80,"Marston nails the claustrophobia of small-town life and the turbulent emotionalism of teenagers, but what pushes the film toward sublimity is the way he delicately captures all of the characters' inner lives as their world slowly crumbles."
5377,sugar-spice-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,75,Fun in its raunchy unwieldiness.
5378,bloody-sunday-movie,Peter Rainer,100,"The most visceral and cumulatively powerful account of civil war since Gillo Pontecorvo's ""The Battle of Algiers."""
5379,space-chimps-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"I went in expecting to be disappointed, but even so, I was disappointed."
5380,the-grifters-movie,Pauline Kael,100,"Huston's power as Lilly is astounding... She bites right through the film-noir pulp; the [climactic] scene is paralyzing, and it won't go away."
5381,the-tortured-1969-movie,Kyle Smith,0,"The movie is so inept - with its flat characters, histrionic acting, dull dialogue (""Killing him is not going to change anything""), a dreadfully overdone musical score and la-la-la flashbacks starring the kid - that its clichés grow slightly funny. But not funny enough to make the endless torture scenes bearable."
5382,the-spirit-movie,Steven Rea,38,"Maybe if there was something going with the dialogue - snappy Chandlerisms, say, or even just sentences that made sense - the fussy digital artifice of The Spirit wouldn't seem so, well, dispiriting."
5383,rocky-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"By now, everyone knows who wins, but the scenes before the fight set us up for it so completely, so emotionally, that when it's over we've had it. We're drained."
5384,cassandras-dream-movie,Shawn Levy,67,"It's not Allen's weakest work, not by far. But its impact is shockingly superficial."
5385,one-lucky-elephant-movie,Alison Willmore,91,"One Lucky Elephant would make an affecting pairing with James Marsh's upcoming ""Project Nim,"" another film about an animal treated like a human until its essential wildness made that impossible. "
5386,judy-moody-and-the-not-bummer-summer-movie,Sandi  Angulo Chen,38,"With summer comes theaters filled with superheroes, sequels and forgettable family fare. In the last category, we find Judy Moody."
5387,killers-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,10,"Unless you’re trapped on an airplane or enjoying movie night at the penitentiary, you have no excuse for watching Killers. A brain-deadening collision of high concept and low standards."
5388,cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-movie,Ernest Hardy,80,"Cloudy is smart, insightful on a host of relationship dynamics, and filled with fast-paced action."
5389,good-hair-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,80,One of those rare documentaries that works on two seemingly incongruous levels at once: It's both social commentary and pure delight.
5390,the-avengers-movie,Maitland McDonagh,30,This big-budget bore looks lovely but is so miscalculated that you can't help but wonder whether anyone involved had ever seen the original.
5391,broken-arrow-movie,Desson Howe,0,Arrow is about as abysmal as abysmal gets.
5392,the-replacements-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"It's absolutely awful, and even Gene Hackman can't carry it across the goal line."
5393,coriolanus-movie,Nick Schager,63,"Though his film's feel is pure Iraq and Afghanistan, Fiennes doesn't push those parallels unduly, and his central performances prove clear, nuanced, and incisive. "
5394,steamboy-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,The movie never transcended its elaborate production work to achieve an independent reality.
5395,the-kids-are-all-right-movie,Rex Reed,75,"Some people might blindly and inaccurately accuse this movie of attacking family values, but it has exactly the opposite effect. Touching and funny in their upheaval, the people in The Kids Are All Right open the door to a brand new examination of family values that leaves you charged and cheering."
5396,happiness-runs-movie,Stephen Holden,0,"This strident exposé may gladden the hearts of some anti-’60s conservatives, but it is a shapeless mess steeped in prurience. Its grain of truthfulness, however, is just enough to leave you unsettled in the pit of your stomach."
5397,flight-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Flight is neither a simple story of heroism, nor one of a fallen hero. Things are more complex than that - and it is its complexities that make the film all the more rewarding an experience."
5398,sphere-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"A watered-down take on the sci-fi classic ""Solaris,"" by Stanislaw Lem, which was made into an immeasurably better film by Andrei Tarkovsky. "
5399,innocence-2001-movie,David Sterritt,75,This unusual romantic drama is sensitively acted by a well-chosen cast and subtly directed by Cox.
5400,hell-ride-movie,Andrea Gronvall,20,"The narrative is murky and ludicrous, the action violent and nihilistic, the contemporary western ethos painfully pretentious."
5401,machine-gun-preacher-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"In Machine Gun Preacher, Gerard Butler says, ""I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of that hurt a lot of people."" But enough about ""The Bounty Hunter,"" ""The Ugly Truth"" and ""P.S. I Love You."""
5402,dont-tell-mom-the-babysitters-dead-movie,Hal Hinson,10,"A cross-pollination of Home Alone and The Secret of My Success, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead is the kind of movie that makes you wish you could sneak into the projection booth with a pair of pinking shears. To say that it's dead isn't really fair; nothing that's dead could be this obnoxious."
5403,grudge-match-movie,Bill Stamets,38,"Grudge Match does not work on any level. The story is unconvincing. The comedy elements are weak... And, worst of all, the acting in most scenes — particularly those involving Sylvester Stallone and Kim Basinger — is atrocious."
5404,roman-polanski-wanted-and-desired-movie,Justin Chang,90,A mesmerizing portrait of the director as acclaimed artist and tortured human being.
5405,wonder-woman-movie,Amy Nicholson,83,"At times, Wonder Woman feels like watching Splash with a shield — another babelicious naïf breaking all the rules. Yet the joke isn't on her. It's on all the men mistaking unsophistication for weakness. To be uncultured is to be mentally free; no one's put on a yoke. That's what makes Wonder Woman a knockout."
5406,21-jump-street-movie,Kyle Smith,88,The funniest movie I've seen in more than a year.
5407,somewhere-in-time-movie,Dave Kehr,10,"Director Jeannot Szwarc strains hard for spectacular visual effects, though he's barely able to compose a competent close-up."
5408,no-end-in-sight-movie,David Edelstein,80,"A meticulous, thoroughly engrossing lesson in how not to win friends (or wars) and influence people (or potential terrorists)."
5409,the-campaign-2012-movie,Gabe Toro,0,"The Campaign is insidiously stupid, a laugh-free water balloon lazily tossed at the institution of politics, and one that makes ""Semi-Pro"" look like a lost Robert Altman film. "
5410,semipro-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"None of Ferrell's movies have ever really done justice to the best of his ""Saturday Night Live"" work, but those of us who love his comedy have learned to take the good with the bad."
5411,anna-karenina-movie,Peter Travers,88,"The story has been filmed many times, but never with this kind of erotic charge. Knightley is glorious, her eyes blazing with a carnal yearning that can turn vindictive at any perceived slight."
5412,babel-movie,Ray Bennett,90,"The filmmakers succeed brilliantly in weaving these stories together, taking time to explore depth of character and relationships. The suspense builds throughout as everyone involved becomes lost in a place they don't understand with people they don't know if they can trust."
5413,sophie-scholl-the-final-days-movie,Tasha Robinson,83,"While the film doesn't dig deep, or hit particularly hard, it neatly achieves its modest goals: presenting a real-life heroine in real-life terms. A film this fictionalized rarely feels this much like fact."
5414,october-sky-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"With its lack of car chases, fist fights, and over-the-top melodrama, the film has to rely on solid acting, an intelligent script, and capable directing."
5415,nymphomaniac-volume-i-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,Danish director Lars von Trier makes this tale of one woman’s banal sexual adventures into inadvertent comedy. The film makes an analogy between sex and fly-fishing — and fly-fishing comes off as more intriguing.
5416,the-fast-runner-atanarjuat-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"Nearly three hours long, and deliberately paced at that, this first feature ever in the Inuit language is a demanding experience. But the rewards for those who risk the journey are simply extraordinary."
5417,a-river-runs-through-it-movie,Hollis Chacona,78,"A pure cinematic distillation of Maclean's words, it is by turns austere and vibrant, disconsolate and joyful."
5418,the-real-cancun-movie,Liam Lacey,12,"The Real Cancun is no crime; at worst, it's a kind of staged tribute to ""Porky's"" done by amateur actors. "
5419,please-give-movie,Justin Chang,70,"Keener, so deliciously nasty in Holofcener's ""Lovely and Amazing,"" is no less engaging here in what is, surprisingly, the film's least bitchy role."
5420,titus-movie,Michael Atkinson,18,"Invoking unpleasant memories of ""Caligula"" (only without the sex), Titus does no justice to Shakespeare."
5421,the-wave-movie,Deborah Young,70,"Though they have little to add to familiar genre themes, Uthaug and the screenwriters make the most of the unique location, which lends itself to jaw-dropping vistas from every camera angle. "
5422,oldboy-2013-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,"Colorless and soulless in the extreme, it bears no one's fingerprints at all. There's no reason for this Oldboy to exist. It's so DOA, you stumble out of it wanting to eat something alive."
5423,woman-in-gold-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,63,"Stirring at times, soggy and overly sentimental at others, the film moves surprisingly slow, even though its action, which takes place over many years of legal maneuvering, has been condensed for narrative expediency."
5424,pay-it-forward-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,30,"No wonder Arlene (Hunt) keeps a bottle of vodka in the chandelier. You would too with this demonic, passive-aggressive, New Age munchkin (Osment) trying to run your life."
5425,wet-hot-american-summer-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,10,"Doesn't swing, doesn't score, can't make it to first base, never even drags its sorry ass out of the dugout."
5426,love-2015-movie,Bilge Ebiri,70,"This is not a rich, novelistic tapestry of humanity; this is a solipsistic world, enclosed on all sides by the director’s ego. But the entrapment is vivid and poignant. Look past all the beautiful people fucking, and you realize that Love is sad in all the right ways."
5427,hotel-rwanda-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,A gut-punch of a drama.
5428,salinger-movie,Dana Stevens,0,"That mystery is certainly hardy enough to withstand the voyeuristic onslaught of this self-aggrandizing, lurid documentary, which leaves the viewer feeling that we’ve been given a tour of Salinger’s septic tank in hip waders without ever getting to knock on his door and say hello."
5429,if-i-stay-movie,Richard Roeper,38,"Director R.J. Cutler is fond of time-lapse establishing shots and rapid-fire montages, none of them particularly effective in conveying this bizarre dual world Mia now inhabits."
5430,killer-of-sheep-movie,Peter Rainer,100,"A lyrical, yet intensely rooted, tragic vision."
5431,the-devils-rejects-movie,James Berardinelli,12,This is a vile and reprehensible motion picture.
5432,particle-fever-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,75,"It plays out with all the suspense of a thriller. Assisted by acclaimed editor Walter Murch, Levinson wisely shapes the story not around the hardware, which was plagued by malfunctions and other delays, but around the people tasked with making the LHC run."
5433,the-hateful-eight-movie,Jaime N. Christley,75,"The premise of the film is simple, but it's a simplicity that can only attract complications, as simple plans are apt to do, in an atmosphere of foreboding and the macabre. "
5434,crossroads-movie,Chuck Wilson,20,"So dull, a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song."
5435,ouija-movie,Claudia Puig,25,A deadly dull and overly familiar movie about summoning ghosts that draws upon nearly every horror movie cliché.
5436,time-out-movie,David Denby,100,"This movie makes one grateful that a serious European art cinema still exists.  [15 April 2002, p. 88]"
5437,a-dogs-purpose-movie,Keith Watson,12,Lasse Hallström's gooey film exists only to offer comforting reassurances about dogs' natural servility. 
5438,crash-1997-movie,Christopher Sharrett,100,"Crash seems incredibly prescient, yet rather naive. The film is a stunning document of our alienated civilization, all the more compelling with its dolorous, almost liturgical tones."
5439,one-day-2011-movie,Peter Travers,12,"This tear-jerking twaddle, adapted by David Nicholls from his 2009 bestseller, is nearly as bad as Anne Hathaway's British accent, which is heading for infamy."
5440,the-fourth-kind-movie,Amy Biancolli,25,"As it stands,The Fourth Kind boasts a creepy kind of joke - and a confusing kind of horror."
5441,paris-can-wait-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"A poorly acted, colossal bore of a film that strikes wrong notes from beginning to end."
5442,the-host-2013-movie,Ty Burr,63,"The Host will make perfect sense to 12-year-old girls, while their college-age sisters will probably laugh themselves sick and their mothers will look at Hurt and wonder when he got so old."
5443,up-movie,Richard Corliss,100,"Extending the patented Pixar mix of humor and heart, Up is the studio's most deeply emotional and affecting work."
5444,juwanna-mann-movie,Laura Sinagra,10,"This flat run at a hip-hop ""Tootsie"" is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines."
5445,better-living-movie,Michael Atkinson,9,"Better, as they say, than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick -- but only just."
5446,the-incredible-burt-wonderstone-movie,Chris Cabin ,38,The film is overtly suspicious and critical of the new and only serviceably romantic about the old.
5447,mr-magoo-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,"If you really hate your kids, pack them off to this slapdash farce, whose only funny moment is the PC disclaimer at the end about the Disney company's humanist concern for blind people (which even literate toddlers will have trouble understanding anyway)."
5448,the-avengers-movie,David Edelstein,10,There's something reassuring about the fact that The Avengers is so rotten: proof yet again that people with piles of money can hire wizard production designers but can't fake class.
5449,big-hero-6-movie,Tom Russo,75,A rousing movie that’s satisfyingly infused with traditional Disney sentiment. 
5450,united-93-movie,Michael Sragow,100,"There's no cheap uplift to their victory, no pop catharsis. What's great about United 93 is that you never feel it's just a movie - even though, as a movie, it's terrific."
5451,animal-house-movie,Robert Martin,88,Animal House is the sort of film you hate yourself for laughing at. It is so gross and tasteless you feel you should be disgusted but it's hard to be offended by something that is so sidesplittingly funny. [05 Aug 1978]
5452,the-fault-in-our-stars-movie,Betsy Sharkey,70,"What sustains the film through the rockier times are its challenging themes, offering real issues for the young protagonists to wrestle with, rather than whether anyone will be carded trying to buy beer."
5453,town-country-movie,Paula Nechak,25,"What it doesn't have is a script that has anything original, cohesive, or, gasp -- funny -- to say."
5454,trouble-with-the-curve-movie,David Denby,70,"The intricate baseball knowledge that gets passed back and forth among the characters in Trouble with the Curve is much more interesting than the moral simplicities that the movie offers. [8 Oct. 2012, p.87]"
5455,big-man-japan-movie,Roger Ebert,88,Very funny in an insidious way.
5456,jet-lag-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,An alarmingly unfunny French comedy where the two main characters are constantly yakking on a cell phone at an airport. 
5457,rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie,Marc Mohan,83,"It's the rest of the movie, especially a grin-inducing final third, which makes ""Apes"" rise above the level of a typical sci-fi rehash. "
5458,waiting-movie,Stephen Holden,0,Putrid comic stew.
5459,songcatcher-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"It's all infuriatingly simplistic, and the performances help matters little. Quinn and McTeer are wholly uncompelling."
5460,house-of-d-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Everyone in the film seems to be in solitary, thanks to Mr. Duchovny's stultifying style. If there was a single moment of spontaneity, it escaped me. Ditto for frivolity, though bogus poetry abounds."
5461,evan-almighty-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"A limp, slow-moving and desperately unfunny comedy."
5462,all-eyez-on-me-movie,Barry Hertz,38,"A cheap, lazy exercise in myth-making. The goods, as it were, will have to be found elsewhere."
5463,departures-movie,Roger Ebert,100,The movie is uncommonly absorbing.
5464,legendary-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"Most of the acting is amateurish at best, and the tone is vintage ""Afterschool Special."" But it does aim to be family-friendly, and at least it succeeds there. "
5465,free-willy-movie,Leonard Klady,100,"An astute, intelligent family picture, the film is a potent reminder that you can have your heart in the right place and still produce a gripping, satisfying entertainment."
5466,the-untold-story-of-emmett-louis-till-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"Beauchamp's film has an earnest solemnity that is appropriate to the material. He has a lot of old black and white TV and newsreel footage, including shots of the accused men before, during and after their trial."
5467,cecil-b-demented-movie,David Ehrenstein,70,Waters offers a worldview that's uniquely his own.
5468,greenberg-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Greenberg, with Stiller's sad and self-mocking portrait at its core, is well worth getting to know."
5469,wild-things-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,A tricky-bordering-on-gimmicky film noir with a glaze of soft-core kink. 
5470,cold-comfort-farm-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,100,"Around town, Stephen Fry (""Peter's Friends""), as a fluty artiste, dogs Flora with his devotion and declares, ""I'm engorgedly in love with you!"" That's how I feel about this gem."
5471,valentines-day-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Less funny or romantic than your average colonoscopy, this cringe-inducing bore provides dubious employment for four Oscar winners, two nominees and a raft of TV performers."
5472,rush-hour-2-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,Looks as if it were thrown together as carelessly as slum housing.
5473,brads-status-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,This is the rare mainstream film that addresses the complexities of real life. Brad’s Status may motivate you to question your own.
5474,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,J. Rentilly,10,The only danger in seeing this film is in busting a gut at its unintentional hilarity.
5475,us-marshals-movie,David Sterritt,75,"Like its precursor, U.S. Marshals has lots of action and the Jones groupies are likeable. Though the overall picture isn't as fine-tuned or character driven, it still delivers what moviegoers want to see - a fast-paced and entertaining chase."
5476,the-men-who-stare-at-goats-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,A magical-realist sitcom war farce that ends up being about nothing but its own slovenly smugness.
5477,the-trumpet-of-the-swan-movie,Sean Axmaker,25,Upbeat but generic songs (one performed by Little Richard) and jazz lines add a little energy but the film feels less like a feature than an expensive ad for the upcoming video.
5478,sorry-to-bother-you-movie,Justin Chang,90,"Not every joke here lands, and not every experiment proves successful, but it scarcely matters. The genius of the picture is that even its wildest, most boundary-pushing formulations are tied to a thoughtful, rigorous thesis about how disparities of race, class and money conspire to keep ruthless systems of human oppression in place."
5479,harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2-movie,Kenneth Turan,80,"Part 2 turns out to be more than the last of its kind. Almost magically, it ends up being one of the best of the series as well."
5480,the-mummy-2017-movie,David Ehrlich,16,"It’s not that it’s bad, it’s that it never could have been good. It’s an irredeemable disaster from start to finish, an adventure that entertains only via glimpses of the adventure it should have been."
5481,reign-of-fire-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,"It's just silly, loud and goofy. The dragon needed a bigger part and the two stars smaller ones."
5482,price-of-glory-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"Contrived and contrived sloppily, this self-adoring soap even manages to make its all-Hispanic cast seem unconvincing -- except for Seda."
5483,cropsey-movie,Noel Murray,83,"Cropsey is compelling as a meditation on how we use stories to explain the inconceivable, and how if no story is handy, we take the available clues and make one up."
5484,fast-food-fast-women-movie,Lisa Nesselson,70,"Boasts engaging characters, inventive situations and a series of satisfying punchlines that will send viewers out with a smile."
5485,halloween-the-curse-of-michael-myers-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Far and away, one of the most tedious, uninspired offerings thus far (and, worst of all, the door is left open for yet another pointless sequel)."
5486,mothers-day-2016-movie,Richard Roeper,0,"Nothing could have prepared us for the offensively stupid, shamelessly manipulative, ridiculously predictable and hopelessly dated crapfest that is Mother’s Day."
5487,finding-vivian-maier-movie,Brian Tallerico,63,She was a true talent. And yet Maloof and Siskel’s film presents an interesting moral quandary along with its profile of an amazing photographer. When does creative ability and the desire to share a true artist’s eye trump what has to be considered an invasion of privacy?
5488,death-of-a-nation-movie,Peter Sobczynski,0,The only thing preventing me from dubbing this one of the dumbest movies of any type that I have ever seen in my life is the fact that I am not entirely certain that something as shabbily constructed and artistically bankrupt as this actually qualifies as a movie in the first place.
5489,unforgiven-movie,Kathleen Carroll,100,"Unforgiven is a high-caliber movie, a gripping and haunting work of art that should finally establish Eastwood as one of America’s best directors."
5490,mortdecai-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Mortdecai is mortdifying, a mortdal sin of a movie that’s headed for the cinematic mortduary."
5491,support-the-girls-movie,John Anderson,100,"The unlikely, bittersweet, bristling comedy Support the Girls is easily one of the best films of the year, and the most sympathetic to women, despite having been made by a man. How can this be? Luckily, Andrew Bujalski’s remarkable movie — with its killer performance by Regina Hall — is not just about women. It’s about men being idiots. And no one is arguing ownership of that narrative."
5492,lockout-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"Lockout is painful. Not painful in the way Uwe Boll or ""Sex and the City"" movies are painful. But painful enough that I kept waiting for Nicolas Cage to show up. Or Katherine Heigl. Or, god forbid, both."
5493,open-water-movie,Joanne Kaufman,70,"Open Water, which was made for $130,000 -- and seemingly without special-effects assistance -- proves you don't have to have a big budget to have an audience on the edge of its seat."
5494,lost-in-translation-movie,Ty Burr,100,"Longer on atmosphere and observation than on story, but you don't mind: Coppola maintains her quietly charged tone with a certainty that would be unbelievable in a second film if you didn't suspect genetics had a hand."
5495,lawless-heart-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"Virtually nothing at all is wrapped up in The Lawless Heart, which is probably why it feels so satisfyingly whole by the end. "
5496,club-dread-movie,Desson Thomson,30,About as funny as malaria. 
5497,better-luck-tomorrow-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Not just a thriller, not just a social commentary, not just a comedy or a romance, but all of those in a clearly seen, brilliantly made film. "
5498,the-other-woman-2014-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,20,"So instead of the rom-com, we now have the “non-com.” The cardboard characters and predictable rhythms remain. But this time, we get all the comic cliches with none of the romance."
5499,lethal-weapon-3-movie,Julie Salamon,0,"It's all played for giggles, this grim anti-humanism. [21 May 1992]"
5500,revolver-movie,M. E. Russell,8,"Although it contains crime and absurdity, it's not thrilling or funny and the title doesn't refer to a gun."
5501,the-rundown-movie,Susannah Gora,75,"Surprisingly clever, high-energy adventure (director Peter Berg should be proud)."
5502,green-lantern-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,"Green Lantern is bad. This despite Mr. Reynolds's dazzling dentistry, hard-body physique and earnest efforts."
5503,our-lady-of-the-assassins-movie,David Ehrenstein,90,One of the most genuinely shocking films you'll ever see.
5504,love-dont-cost-a-thing-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,38,"But where the original was slight but sweet, the remake is depressingly superficial and cynical."
5505,swept-away-movie,Peter Rainer,10,"If you were expecting Ritchie to discover something in Madonna that no one else has, something like, say, acting talent, forget it."
5506,lincoln-movie,Michael Phillips,100,"It blends cinematic Americana with something grubbier and more interesting than Americana, and it does not look, act or behave like the usual perception of a Spielberg epic. It is smaller and quieter than that."
5507,war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie,A.O. Scott,100,"There is a scene toward the end of War for the Planet of the Apes that is as vivid and haunting as anything I’ve seen in a Hollywood blockbuster in ages, a moment of rousing and dreadful cinematic clarity that I don’t expect to shake off any time soon."
5508,spring-breakers-movie,Manohla Dargis,100,"In Spring Breakers [Mr. Korine] bores into a contested, deeply American topic — the pursuit of happiness taken to nihilistic extremes — but turns his exploration into such a gonzo, outrageously funny party that it takes a while to appreciate that this is more of a horror film than a comedy."
5509,american-outlaws-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,Les Mayfield's unintentionally wry American Outlaws just smells -- of filmmaking manure as well as yard-sale revisionism.
5510,twisted-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,"A nasty, formulaic and unforgivably obvious procedural. "
5511,trixie-movie,Wesley Morris,12,Highfalutin swill determined to pass itself off as a jazzy caper.
5512,enders-game-movie,Scott Bowles,38,"Most Ender's fans, of course, won't care about comparisons and consider the film adaptation a long-awaited victory in itself. Those fresh to the tale — or at least expecting something fresh from it — may wonder what the fuss was about."
5513,valentines-day-movie,Claudia Puig,38,The film feels as calculatedly sentimental as one of those bland pink candy hearts.
5514,warcraft-movie,Chris Nashawaty,25,"It’s soulless, incoherent, Renaissance Faire hooey. And since the latest iteration of game series that inspired it, World of Warcraft, already peaked years ago, even the timing is off.  "
5515,the-fog-of-war-eleven-lessons-from-the-life-of-robert-s-mcnamara-movie,David Hughes,100,The film's status as must-see documentary of the year is indisputable.
5516,olympus-has-fallen-movie,Ian Buckwalter,35,Feels from start to finish like a throwback to the action cinema and military thrillers of decades past.
5517,beyond-a-reasonable-doubt-movie,Peter Travers,25,"What I can’t figure out is how director Peter Hyams can remake a 1956 movie from the great Fritz Lang and not learn anything about suspense, pacing and storytelling in the process. This movie is beyond boring. You could stay warm for two hours by striking a match to the wooden acting."
5518,hot-pursuit-movie,Andrew Barker,30,"A few mildly tone-deaf jokes are hardly enough to sink Hot Pursuit. What does, however, is its tendency to belabor the laziest, most obvious gags beyond the point of reason."
5519,tattoo-bar-movie,Nick Rutigliano,10,This tale of a sprung tough looking to go straight is so familiar it's faceless.
5520,hollywood-homicide-movie,Kevin Carr,10,"Yup, Hollywood Homicide”rips off practically every cop movie out there. My god in heaven, did anyone making this film have an original thought in their lives?"
5521,taking-lives-movie,Wesley Morris,25,"Because the characters in the movie have only stock obsessions and vague personal histories, there's no reason to be interested in them. "
5522,ran-re-release-movie,G. Allen Johnson,100,"Kurosawa pulled out all the stops with Ran, his obsession with loyalty and his love of expressionistic film techniques allowed to roam freely."
5523,madagascar-movie,Lawrence Toppman,88,"The animals' personalities have been carefully calibrated: They have sufficient edge to amuse us as characters, yet they're cuddly enough to market as plush toys or action figures."
5524,dirty-grandpa-movie,Josh Kupecki,0,"Dirty Grandpa is like that drunk guy at a party who corners you, shooting an endless litany of raunchy and offensive jokes until you finally laugh. It is comedy as pummel, wearing you down until finally you gasp, “Uncle!”"
5525,finding-vivian-maier-movie,Anthony Lane,70,"Even as this fine documentary unveils the ""mystery woman,"" as she once described herself, it remains intent on the molding of her myth.  [31 March 2014, p.80]"
5526,american-honey-movie,Steve Persall,91,"Sure, Arnold's movie is aimless, at times frustrating, like its characters. It's also a harshly poetic reflection on what being young must mean today."
5527,miss-meadows-movie,Serena Donadoni,90,"Holmes and Dale are ideal together, turning a polite courtship and charged relationship (including a sex scene that's both giddy and profound) into a twisted, compelling expression of unconditional love."
5528,persecuted-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"The Lord works in mysterious ways but Persecuted works in blundering, obvious ways, straining a Christianity-under-attack theme through a dopey thriller."
5529,house-of-flying-daggers-movie,Dana Stevens,80,"A gorgeous entertainment, a feast of blood, passion and silk brocade. But though the picture is full of swirling, ecstatic motion, it is not especially moving."
5530,selfless-movie,Ann Hornaday,0,"Self/less bears not a trace of Singh’s signature visual richness, quickly devolving into a tiresome game of cat and mouse, padded with cliched fight scenes, car chases and shootouts."
5531,gods-not-dead-2-movie,Nick Schager,0,"Dramatically speaking, God’s Not Dead 2 operates at the level of your average middle-school play – except with far greater levels of upside-down logic and bald-faced intolerance for anyone not enraptured by the New Testament."
5532,con-air-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"This is a movie that knows it is absurd, and does little to deny it. "
5533,beyond-the-hills-movie,Ty Burr,88,"It’s a deceptively impersonal style, because Beyond the Hills seethes with astonishment and rage at a broken society marooned between the 21st century and the 16th."
5534,the-pink-panther-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,"Most of the humor in The Pink Panther derives from Martin's silly French accent, especially when he tries to pronounce the word ""hamburger."" But zat joke, she ees not funny. And The Pink Panther ees, how you say, ze real dog."
5535,300-rise-of-an-empire-movie,James Rocchi,0,The empty violence and pointless style are only the biggest problems. 
5536,ben-hur-movie,Glenn Kenny,75,"I’m not qualified to say whether it’s an effective delivery system for its Christian message, but I think I can credibly pronounce it a good popcorn movie. "
5537,500-days-of-summer-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"The film has an easygoing, inquisitive spirit, heightened by Webb's visual conceits"
5538,the-dinner-movie,Owen Gleiberman,90,"Moverman balances the potential for staginess with his flowing cinematic bravura; he keeps surprising you, and he gives the drama a dash of poison elegance."
5539,winter-passing-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"Deschanel is great, with her feral eyes and Joey Ramone shag haircut, and Ferrell is fantastic. This one's worth the effort to find."
5540,eragon-movie,Chris Hewitt (1),20,"Technically competent, but essentially a fantasy movie that mistakes industrial light for magic. As dragon movies go, Dragonslayer, Reign Of Fire and even Dragonheart can rest easy."
5541,underworld-blood-wars-movie,Peter Travers,12,"Like the four franchise fillers that preceded it, Underworld: Blood Wars is undoubtedly impervious to bad reviews. What it needs is a stake through the heart. "
5542,malena-movie,Henry Cabot Beck,10,"In the end, Malena is an unlikable and foul farce, unworthy of Tornatore's previously gentle touch."
5543,the-samaritan-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"A would-be piece of pulp fiction about a parolee trying to go straight, The Samaritan proves that even Samuel L. Jackson can be boring."
5544,bruce-almighty-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"It's all rote, sleep-inducing formula, but it might have still worked if the movie weren't so timid and unimaginative."
5545,strange-magic-movie,Alonso Duralde,5,"Terrible character design, combined with a painful lack of laughs and a crushing plethora of ghastly songs, makes Strange Magic perhaps the worst animated feature ever to come out of Disney (which might explain why the studio is releasing the film under its now-rarely-used Touchstone label). Compared to other Lucas missteps of recent years, it’ll make you nostalgic for Jar Jar Binks."
5546,antz-movie,Walter Addiego,75,"That's not to say the entertaining Antz"" was made by Woody, just that it's full of his personality."
5547,the-chronicles-of-narnia-the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"A movie of intelligence and power, of beauty, universality and largeness of spirit."
5548,then-she-found-me-movie,Matthew Sorrento,30,"Overall, the film is lost and never found. In her first shot as director, Hunt seems direction-less."
5549,the-fighting-temptations-movie,Nathan Rabin,30,"The energetic musical sequences help make it feel warmer and more ingratiating than it otherwise would, which is fortunate, since this rickety vehicle needs all the help it can get. "
5550,gett-the-trial-of-viviane-amsalem-movie,David Edelstein,90,"The brilliance of Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem is that, without a shift in tone, the film begins to seem like a tragedy populated by clowns, its males clinging to ancient laws to compensate for feebleness of character. "
5551,isnt-she-great-movie,Steven Rea,0,Has to be among the worst movies ever made.
5552,the-connection-movie,Peter Sobczynski,88,"While the results inevitably pale in comparison to ""The French Connection"" — which could be said about virtually every other film currently in release — they do make for an above-average work that offers viewers a new perspective on a familiar story."
5553,rear-window-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"There is never an instant, in fact, when Director Hitchcock is not in minute and masterly control of his material: script, camera, cutting, props, the handsome set constructed from his ideas, the stars he has Hitched to his vehicle."
5554,original-sin-movie,Desson Thomson,10,About half a notch above disaster.
5555,very-bad-things-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"There is a line between gallows humor and tastelessness, but Very Bad Things apparently doesn't have a clue where that might be. "
5556,the-world-movie,Scott Foundas,90,"The comic, tragic and monumentally beautiful new film by writer-director Jia Zhangke (Platform)."
5557,the-central-park-five-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"The case transfixed a racially polarized New York City. The teens were labeled as a ""wolf pack"" by the news media, led by the New York tabloids. "
5558,thirteen-conversations-about-one-thing-movie,Loren King,88,"Resonates with intelligence and a poignancy made more sorrowful by what happened to all of us, but especially to New Yorkers, on that terrible day."
5559,a-sound-of-thunder-movie,Scott Brown,0,"So perfect in its awfulness, it makes one seriously consider a theory of unintelligent design."
5560,juwanna-mann-movie,Dana Stevens,70,"But even though, most of the time, you know exactly what will happen next -- you don't much mind.  Nor do the many plot holes and improbabilities -- undermine its silly, raucous spirit."
5561,thomas-and-the-magic-railroad-movie,Monica Eng,38,"Children's films can be thrilling affairs for parents and kids. Unfortunately, this film is not likely to thrill either group."
5562,the-burbs-movie,Mike Clark,38,"'Burbs is a messy mix of Gremlins, Neighbors, Rear Window and Arsenic and Old Lace. [17 Feb 1989, p.6D]"
5563,the-smurfs-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,11,"What the kids at my screening seemed to like best was the wizard's cat, whose mouth is computer-manipulated to utter pithy asides. "
5564,four-christmases-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"The movie doesn't offer a single surprise within its scant 82 minutes, which feel like at least twice that."
5565,changing-lanes-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"Gets too caught up in its escalating violence and strained-to-bursting moral subtexts. It's the blood of souls drenching the screen, and it's a hideous sight to behold."
5566,wolf-creek-movie,Ken Fox,88,"Easily one of the most brutally realistic horror movies since the original ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974)."
5567,backstage-2000-movie,David Segal,10,"Mostly, these guys carry on like spoiled children, complaining, roughhousing and badgering women to strip naked."
5568,house-of-the-sleeping-beauties-movie,Vadim Rizov,0,"One of the year's worst releases. A second viewing of ""Synecdoche"" would be less painful."
5569,away-from-her-movie,Dennis Harvey,80,"What Away From Her achieves is quite admirable-- a low-key, intelligent setting for performances marked by those same qualities."
5570,disgrace-movie,Bob Mondello,80,"John Malkovich has played some odd ducks in his career, but for sheer unsavoriness, few can match the blandly monstrous Cape Town poetry professor he brings to off-putting life in Disgrace."
5571,detroit-rock-city-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"Such a stupid, painfully obvious, gratingly unfunny dud that it's unlikely to please even the most gullible and easy-to-please members of the Kiss army."
5572,rebel-without-a-cause-movie,Geoff Andrew,90,"What makes the film so powerful is both the sympathy it extends towards all the characters (including the seemingly callous parents) and the precise expressionism of Ray's direction. His use of light, space and motion is continually at the service of the characters' emotions, while the trio that Dean, Wood and Mineo form as a refuge from society is explicitly depicted as an 'alternative family'. Still the best of the youth movies."
5573,spirited-away-movie,Don Irvine,88,"The most successful film ever released in Japan, and co-winner of the top prize at this year's Berlin film festival, Spirited Away is a complete reversal of the Hollywood way with animation."
5574,the-great-raid-movie,Mike Clark,38,Just about any golden age Hollywood hack could have made a zestier drama about one of the greatest rescue missions in U.S. military history.
5575,rejoice-and-shout-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"Only rarely does the film present a genuine insight, such as the observation that many black people loved to dress up in their finest for church because, during the week, they were so often dressed as servants and manual laborers."
5576,restrepo-movie,Peter Rainer,91,"Because the war in Afghanistan is so much in the news now – it should always have been so – a movie like Restrepo is both a bracing document and, in a larger sense, a disappointment."
5577,love-sex-movie,Kevin Maynard,5,Love & Sex is nothing but pain and suffering.
5578,a-wrinkle-in-time-movie,Vince Mancini,25,"If anything, the trouble with Wrinkle is that you never really get a sense of DuVernay’s personal touch. In fact, it feels a lot like Brad Bird’s big budget, equally smarmy 2015 Disney film, Tomorrowland. Both attempt to be so broad and universal that they feel disconnected from anything human."
5579,around-the-bend-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,The longest 85-minute road trip you could imagine.
5580,the-last-station-movie,Ann Hornaday,63,"At its best, The Last Station vividly illustrates the enduring Russian gift for iconography, whether spiritual, secular or something in between."
5581,the-nut-job-movie,Kevin McFarland,0,The most egregious problem with The Nut Job is how shamelessly it fills in the gaps left by expanding Lepeniotis’ short with generic and tedious rogue-to-hero cliché.
5582,the-place-beyond-the-pines-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,100,"A brilliant, towering picture, The Place Beyond The Pines is a cinematic accomplishment of extraordinary grace and insight."
5583,the-last-airbender-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"Shyamalan takes the beloved Nickelodeon anime series -- the full title was Avatar: The Last Airbender -- and turns it into 103 minutes of overproduced, stilted nonsense."
5584,the-son-movie,J. Hoberman,90,"For all its quasi-documentary materialism, The Son is ultimately a Christian allegory of one man's inchoate desire to return good for evil. The movie requires a measure of faith, and like a job well done, it repays that trust."
5585,take-care-movie,Andrew Lapin,10,"The movie is dreadful, filled with painfully broad humor, grating performances, and acidly rendered characters. "
5586,the-rage-carrie-2-movie,Marc Savlov,20,Toils in high school hell and doesn't even manage to come up with one good shock.
5587,brooklyns-finest-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Whatever one may think of the overall style--I think it's ludicrous--Mr. Fuqua clearly wanted his film to be operatic, and so it is, in a tone-deaf way."
5588,the-a-team-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"Convoluted, overstuffed, turned up to 11, and yet, somehow, deadly dull--in other words, white noise."
5589,the-core-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Built from an alloy of absurdium and stupidium, with the latter, heavier element dominating the mix."
5590,4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days-movie,Michael Sragow,100,"Without a single gunshot (and just one flick of a switchblade), it turns into an existential suspense film with the highest stakes imaginable: the survival of the human spirit."
5591,good-burger-movie,Desmond Ryan,63,"The comedy is usually silly, and - in keeping with the fare served up at these busy counters - often tasteless. The wiry Mitchell and the chubby Thompson may physically suggest such great teams as Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello, but - at this stage of their development - the resemblance ends there. [25 July 1997, p.04]"
5592,just-visiting-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"I haven't seen the original, and this mishmash -- doesn't make me want to."
5593,surveillance-movie,Manohla Dargis,0,"It seems doubtful that Surveillance, a would-be transgression that tries to squeeze dark laughs from the spectacle of human suffering, would be taking up space in theaters if its director were not the daughter of a name filmmaker."
5594,enemy-at-the-gates-movie,Jami Bernard,88,"The sniper's life is a lonely one, full of shallow breathing and delayed gratification. Solitary as it is, Jude Law manages to get a little action in the bunkers of wartime Stalingrad in the ambitious but sometimes inadvertently silly Enemy at the Gates."
5595,the-homesman-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,80,"Glendon Swarthout’s 1988 novel offered a rare approach to those Old West stories by shifting the focus to the women and children who often bore its brunt the worst, and Jones has — for the most part — successfully captured this, often in devastating fashion."
5596,the-good-heart-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"As robust and clever an actor as Cox is, he can't make Jacques any less of a blowhard; Kari's wit simply doesn't come through in English, at least with this script."
5597,toy-story-3-movie,Kristin Hunt,88,"The credits may be silly, but the last scene is a definite tear-jerker."
5598,quitting-movie,Sean Axmaker,100,"The total effect is mesmerizing, an eye-opening tour of modern Beijing culture in a journey of rebellion, retreat into oblivion and return."
5599,the-women-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,20,"Is it an exaggeration to call The Women the worst movie of the year? Well, yeah, probably. But it may be the most disappointing, given all the effort that went into it."
5600,tomb-raider-movie,Roger Moore,38,"When your set pieces fail to surprise, your dialogue fails to deliver even one decent one-liner and your villain looks like he’s dealing with dysentery on location, maybe 17-18 years isn’t long enough between reboots."
5601,wanted-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,80,"For all of its shortcomings, Wanted is a strangely enjoyable flick."
5602,the-women-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,"It's not particularly fun, or funny, for starters."
5603,in-the-bedroom-movie,Desmond Ryan,100,"When it comes to the realistic portrayal of the complex process of grief, most actresses are at a loss. Sissy Spacek is decidedly not most actresses."
5604,the-queen-movie,J.R. Jones,90,"Helen Mirren's flinty performance as Elizabeth II is getting all the attention, but equally impressive is Peter Morgan's insightful script for this UK drama, which quietly teases out the social, political, and historical implications of the 1997 death of Diana, Princess of Wales."
5605,a-chorus-line-movie,Julie Salamon,10,"When director Richard Attenborough isn't mangling dance numbers, he's focusing on a love story expressed almost entirely by means of close-ups of moony faces and teary eyes. [12 Dec 1985]"
5606,pitch-perfect-3-movie,Leah Greenblatt,67,"Mostly this is all just pretext for dreamy postcard shots of Europe, a metric ton of slapstick, and as many highly specific vocal riff-offs as one empty airplane hangar can handle."
5607,conviction-movie,Roger Moore,88,The magic in the film is in the actors. Only somebody who has stripped himself emotionally bare for the camera could achieve the level of performance that Goldwyn gets from every single SAG member on this set.
5608,thunder-and-the-house-of-magic-movie,Charles Solomon,30,"Directors Ben Stassen and Jérémie Degruson have assembled so many clichés and bits borrowed from other films that ""Thunder"" feels like a rerun on its first viewing."
5609,jersey-girl-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"The nadir of the movie -- or cheesy zenith -- is Ollie's sodden soliloquy, delivered in the presence of his baby, in which he laments the loss of her mother and his wife. All that's missing are the strains of Ravel's ""Pavane For a Dead Princess."""
5610,innocence-2014-movie,Roger Moore,38,"A stylish, moody and atmospheric tale contorted into a young adult horror story, it never works up a decent fright."
5611,darkness-falls-movie,Maitland McDonagh,30,"Its real problem is that Matilda Dixon, apparently conceived as a cross between the Blair Witch and Freddy Krueger, is an oddly characterless bogeyman, perhaps because she's 100 percent special effects technology with no actor underneath."
5612,compliance-movie,Sheri Linden,90,"With its harrowing restraint, Compliance is potent filmmaking that's not easily forgotten."
5613,the-guest-movie,Matt Glasby,80,"Cool as you like one second, camp as Christmas the next, this entertainingly overpumped action-horror will have genre fans (and their mums) grinning from ear to ear."
5614,our-brand-is-crisis-2015-movie,John Semley,25,"It’s the kind of film that can’t even bother to commit to its own cynicism, which makes it the most deeply cynical kind of film there is."
5615,in-praise-of-love-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"Like most Godard, it can be watched repeatedly, always yielding new secrets and beauties. Most profound of all, perhaps, are those incredible black-and-white images of Paris."
5616,final-fantasy-the-spirits-within-movie,Ed Epstein,30,"Although packaged as a movie, is in reality a clever 106-minute promo for Sony's PlayStation II games."
5617,inside-job-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"Matt Damon narrates, and I do wish the narration didn't end on such a generalized, throw-the-bums-out note, over footage of the Statue of Liberty. "
5618,uhf-movie,Gene Siskel,0,"Viewing UHF may be injurious to your sense of humor. Rarely has a comedy tried so hard and failed so often to be funny. [21 Jul 1989, p.A]"
5619,tower-movie,Robert Abele,100,"Tower is art, first and foremost, a piece about adrenaline, bravery, grief and memory that stands as one of the year’s crowning achievements in emotional, illuminative storytelling."
5620,love-me-if-you-dare-movie,Ty Burr,63,"French films have long specialized in depicting the impassioned, go-for-broke infatuation known as l'amour fou. Yann Samuell's Love Me If You Dare may be the first to investigate l'amour annoying."
5621,bobby-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,63,"This is simply too vast a task for a filmmaker as inexperienced as Estevez. Compared with, say, Robert Altman's similar but far more complex ""Nashville,"" Bobby mostly comes off as a Hollywood public service announcement: passionate, righteous and strikingly removed from reality."
5622,dolls-movie,Ty Burr,75,"Dolls is an art film, and a languid, inexplicably haunting one at that."
5623,custody-movie,Tim Robey,100,"As a demonstration of slighted masculinity being given an inch, taking a mile, and chewing it up with breakneck fury, the film could hardly be more timely or disconcerting. But it understands the ignition point of rage – not just its ugly momentum."
5624,lost-embrace-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"It's in the brightly observed vignettes from mall-society life, captured with a low-key, on-the-run visual style, that Burman shows his best stuff and deadpan wit."
5625,friend-request-movie,Alonso Duralde,5,An utterly idiotic movie that uses social media as a conduit for witchcraft and mayhem.
5626,a-most-wanted-man-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"Hoffman, bloated and flushed, does not look well in this film. But he is such a consummate actor that whatever infirmities he may have been fighting become a part of his performance. His portrayal, complete with a convincing German accent, is a fully rounded portrait of courage and dissolution."
5627,the-do-over-movie,Michael Phillips,0,"There are comedies that make you double over in laughter, and there are comedies that are eerily unfunny to the point where you start thinking about a class-action suit."
5628,dancer-in-the-dark-movie,David Ansen,80,Bjork gives what may be the most wrenching performance ever given by someone who has no interest in being an actor.
5629,the-musketeer-movie,Jay Carr,38,"The images are pretty, and Gene Quintano's screenplay gets everybody from point A to point B, though with no discernible knack for wit or subtlety."
5630,jack-and-jill-movie,Peter Travers,0,"A total bust, a stupefyingly unfunny and shamelessly lazy farce packed with cringe-worthy jokes and overt product placement."
5631,the-kid-i-movie,Stephen Holden,30,"Good intentions do not guarantee good movies, or even watchable ones. A sad case in point is The Kid and I."
5632,the-station-agent-movie,Connie Ogle,75,"Despite its humble nature, the film is downright uplifting without being vulgar, flashy or embarrassing."
5633,borat-cultural-learnings-of-america-for-make-benefit-glorious-nation-of-kazakhstan-movie,Steven Rea,88,Baron Cohen brings scary conviction to the performance.
5634,monster-movie,Megan Lehmann,75,"Jenkins doesn't stint on the sickening reality of Wuornos' abhorrent behavior -- it's Theron's complex, deeply felt depiction of a thoroughly messed-up soul that forces us to look beyond the monstrous nature of her acts."
5635,sparkle-2011-movie,Courtney Shea,38,"Anyone who has seen ""Dream Girls,"" ""What's Love Got To Do With It?"" or even ""The Doors"" will find themselves in familiar (if inferior) territory here."
5636,american-psycho-movie,Kenneth Turan,20,"Stillborn, pointless piece of work."
5637,the-hunger-games-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,85,"There's action here, too, and a great deal of vitality that feels true both to the spirit of Collins' book and to the idea of movie entertainment as it exists."
5638,black-panther-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,83,"There are hiccups in its ambition, but it’s hard not to get swept up in all the technologies, characters, and politics crammed into the movie’s compelling dramatic conflict, which casts the charismatic Michael B. Jordan—the star of Creed and Coogler’s debut, Fruitvale Station—as the most complex villain in the post-Dark Knight cycle of superhero blockbusters."
5639,old-dogs-movie,Ty Burr,12,"It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without a turkey, and in Old Dogs, we have the season’s blue-ribbon gobbler."
5640,million-dollar-arm-movie,Kate Erbland,69,"This is a film about a journey, and while the destination – baseball’s major leagues – is continuously dangled in front of its protagonists, it’s getting there that counts. Oh, and also how fast you can throw a ball. That counts, too."
5641,little-nicky-movie,Sean Means,10,Disgusting and humorless mess.
5642,shrek-the-third-movie,Peter Debruge,63,"What does set Shrek the Third apart is the quality of its animation, which reaches a level of expressiveness in the faces that would make even Hollywood's heavily Botoxed live-action stars envious."
5643,son-of-the-mask-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"But for anyone who assumed Kennedy's experiment couldn't sink any lower than ""Malibu's Most Wanted,"" there are, it appears, ever deeper depths in the realm of comedic misfires."
5644,tio-papi-movie,Aaron Hillis,20,Doesn't try to be anything more than a soft-serve pull of treacly pandering. 
5645,vice-2015-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,0,"Here’s hoping Bruce Willis bought something special with whatever cash he earned from this pointless, brutally ugly rehash of 1973’s “Westworld.”"
5646,the-pink-panther-movie,James Berardinelli,25,"The Pink Panther is supposed to use humor to uplift. Instead, I departed this movie feeling depressed."
5647,the-woodsman-movie,Michael Wilmington,63,Melodrama triumphs.  But here's at least some muted applause for a fine cast and filmmakers trying to confront the real world and its shadows.
5648,iron-man-2-movie,Roger Moore,75,"A movie franchise can only take us by surprise once, and by that measure, Iron Man 2 is a preordained letdown. But so much of what gave the first film its gas —  is still here."
5649,outside-in-movie,Moira Macdonald,88,"Outside In is about connection, and about two remarkable actors telling us a story."
5650,spy-kids-2-island-of-lost-dreams-movie,Scott Tobias,80,The rare sequel that magnifies the scope of the original without diminishing the fun.
5651,the-order-movie,Rick Kisonak,20,Godawful mess.
5652,much-ado-about-nothing-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,The first filmed Shakespeare comedy in decades that’s actually funny.
5653,a-prairie-home-companion-movie,Rob Nelson,90,"Keillor's modest subservience to Altman's group dynamic feels downright gallant, and in the context of the veteran director's most humanistic movie by a wide margin, it certainly has its rewards."
5654,looking-for-comedy-in-the-muslim-world-movie,Nathan Rabin,91,"Like ""The Aristocrats,"" Looking succeeds smashingly both as a comedy and as a savvy deconstruction of comedy."
5655,the-heat-movie,Andrew Schenker,63,"With the film, Melissa McCarthy definitively cements her status as a legitimate comic talent, leaving her co-star stumbling behind in her wake."
5656,the-ridiculous-6-movie,Nick Schager,16,"Without an amusing instinct in its cowboy-hatted head, this painfully protracted, puerile effort meanders about the Old West as if it were making up its nonsense on the fly. The result is a torturous genre joke that marks a new low not only for the star, but for the art of cinematic comedy."
5657,the-dukes-of-hazzard-movie,Peter Travers,0,There is no wrong time to flush this turd. The only bright spot comes during the outtakes over the final credits.
5658,crystal-fairy-the-magical-cactus-movie,Marc Mohan,83,"With barely a hint of trippy visuals, it captures the highs and lows of one mind-expanding surfside day. "
5659,how-to-be-single-movie,Peter Travers,38,"Though Wilson is always reason enough to see a movie, she’s stuck here in a fluffball that plays like warmed-over subplots from ""Sex and the City."""
5660,the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn---part-2-movie,Steven Rea,63,Easily the trippiest and goofiest of the five addled adolescent vampire romances based on the Stephenie Meyer books.
5661,thirteen-movie,Brooke Hauser,100,"The result is a disturbing look into the so-called Wonder Years of adolescence, with convincing, award-worthy performances from each of its key players: Hunter, Wood, and Reed."
5662,made-of-honor-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"It's something old, it's something new, it's something borrowed and it's something that blows."
5663,freddy-got-fingered-movie,Roger Ebert,0,This movie doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.
5664,the-raid-redemption-movie,Andy Klein,91,"Extraordinary stunt and fight work and nonstop excitement, but a warning to those who are at all squeamish: this may be the most violent movie I've ever seen."
5665,frozen-2013-movie,Peter Hartlaub,100,The studio made a great film.
5666,sid-and-nancy-movie,Clayton Dillard,100,"Sid & Nancy, in its first half, offers an immersive plunge into the punk lifestyle, capturing with wit and verve its anti-authoritarian sneer and DIY ethos, before then slowly circling the drain during a dour second half given over to disillusion and dissolution."
5667,junebug-movie,Laura Sinagra,80,"It's an exhilaratingly decentered tale, with the perspective shifting around so there's no character with whom we totally identify throughout."
5668,answers-to-nothing-movie,David Fear,20,"Not one single character strikes you as being anything but a mouthpiece for writer-director Matthew Leutwyler's simplistic views on socio-emotional problems (racial self-hatred! post-rehab guilt!) or an excuse for self-satisfied, back-patting acting exercises. The title is an understatement."
5669,the-deer-hunter-movie,Gene Siskel,100,"What distinguishes The Deer Hunter most is its many rich characters and the size of its vision. This is a big film, dealing with big issues, made on a grand scale. Much of it, including some casting decisions, suggest inspiration by ""The Godfather."" [9 Mar 1979]"
5670,goodbye-to-language-3d-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,88,"It's a rapturous experience, mostly, though tempered by a certain Godardian crankiness. Watching it is, I would imagine, as close as we'll get to being able to be Godard, sitting there thinking, or dreaming. It's a documentary of a restless mind. "
5671,four-weddings-and-a-funeral-movie,Megan Rosenfeld,70,"A movie to cheer you up and on and help you feel that spring will, in fact, arrive before we are all too desiccated to enjoy it."
5672,the-greatest-showman-movie,Derek Smith,38,The Greatest Showman‘s spectacle is overshadowed by its archaic and misguided notions of American exceptionalism.
5673,gods-and-generals-movie,Kevin Carr,20,This is nothing but an attempt to cash in on the success of “Gettysburg.”
5674,good-time-movie,Guy Lodge,100,"These restlessly independent auteurs have passed the genre-foray test with flying neon colors, at no cost or compromise to their abrasively humane worldview."
5675,good-luck-chuck-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,It was like a Farrelly brothers gross-out without the laughs.
5676,billionaire-boys-club-movie,Peter Debruge,20,"There are no billionaires here, just a lot of testosterone where the movie’s brains ought to be."
5677,pariah-movie,Amy Biancolli,100,"The film benefits most of all from Rees' careful screenplay, which dances that shifting line between fear and emergent hope. One of Alike's poems says it best: ""Even breaking is opening. And I am broken. I am open."""
5678,boyz-n-the-hood-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"Flows in a way that seems effortless, following its own path, arriving at its own place. Only after the movie is over are the outlines of its story apparent. I found it impossible to outguess it. [12 July 1991]"
5679,hamlet-1991-movie,Caryn James,80,"Mel Gibson's Hamlet is strong, intelligent and safely beyond ridicule.... He is by far the best part of Mr. Zeffirelli's sometimes slick but always lucid and beautifully cinematic version of the play."
5680,rabbit-hole-movie,Ty Burr,88,"Rabbit Hole is a personal project for Kidman - she produced the film after falling in love with the play - and it seems to have revived the quickness in her. That ice-blue gaze has found its focus again, and it looks deep into the one thing none of us want to face."
5681,dream-house-2011-movie,Rob Humanick,63,"A modest genre entry, Dream House also benefits from the fact that any movie with good enough sense to cast Elias Koteas is automatically better as a result, even if he is utterly wasted here."
5682,the-gangster-squad-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"His (Fleischer) first feature, ""Zombieland,"" was a half-witty genre parody. This one might be described as genre zombie-ism: the hysterical, brainless animation of dead clichés reduced to purposeless, compulsive killing. Too self-serious to succeed as pastiche, it has no reason for being beyond the parasitic urge to feed on the memories of other, better movies. "
5683,fifty-dead-men-walking-movie,Cliff Doerksen,30,"A muddled, talky affair, part soap opera, part undercover police procedural."
5684,fame-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,15,My advice to potential audiences: Find something else to do.
5685,winnie-mandela-movie,Scott MacDonald,33,"Poor Hudson tries to live up to both the character and the clothes, but she isn’t anywhere near assertive enough a screen presence; whenever she’s supposed to be rallying a crowd or shouting down her oppressors she looks painfully aware of her own inadequacy.  "
5686,mr-woodcock-movie,Kyle Smith,63,The insult comedy is sometimes brilliant.
5687,sabans-power-rangers-movie,Robbie Collin,20,"The ugly and incomprehensible big finish we get appears to have been shot by the Hunchback of Notre Dame and edited by a monkey wearing oven gloves, and if there’s a single clear shot of the Dinozords in action in there, I must have missed it."
5688,im-still-here-movie,Roger Moore,38,"It's all tiresome, muddied and artlessly made."
5689,the-chaperone-movie,Nathan Rabin,16,"The Chaperone is being marketed as a comedy, though no one seems to have told anyone involved."
5690,listen-to-me-marlon-movie,Ty Burr,100,"The result is something that feels fresh, even revelatory — a work of elegiac bio-doc impressionism. Listen to Me Marlon gets under the skin of the most mysterious performer of the 20th century and forces us to recalibrate all our feelings about him."
5691,crazy-heart-movie,J.R. Jones,80,"Robert Duvall, who played a similar character in Bruce Beresford's ""Tender Mercies"" (1983), turns up in a supporting role."
5692,raw-movie,Rex Reed,0,"Word to the wise: Start saving the vomit bags from your airplane flights. With movies like this, you’re gonna need them."
5693,the-adventures-of-sharkboy-and-lavagirl-3-d-movie,Ann Hornaday,20,"Visually undistinguished, narratively inert, populated by a cast of charmless child actors, ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl,"" with any luck will fade quickly from theaters, memories and Rodriguez's own Things to Do Today list."
5694,see-spot-run-movie,Robert Koehler,10,"Gruff and downright smelly, especially when star David Arquette is forced at one point to flop around in a pile of doggy doo."
5695,the-happening-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"The Happening makes you wonder whether Mr. Shyamalan's own switch may have been flipped. How else to explain his film's befuddling infelicities, insistent banalities, shambling pace and pervasive ineptitude?"
5696,gilles-wife-movie,Lisa Nesselson,90,"Told primarily via body language and facial expressions with a minimum of dialogue, beautifully observed, emotionally intense tale is an ambitious and rewarding outing for Frederic Fonteyne."
5697,the-losers-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"The Losers is simply a lot of low blows, telegraphed each and every time."
5698,the-shape-of-things-movie,Dennis Harvey,90,"Very much in line with his maiden screen efforts ""In the Company of Men"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors""...ends with a satisfying shudder of recognition at the extreme cruelty possible within human relationships, particularly those conceived by Neil LaBute. "
5699,down-with-love-movie,Rick Kisonak,10,Down With Love has little to offer besides hip sixties references better films have already made and made infinitely more hip.
5700,the-class-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"The Class is a lovely, exhilarating work about the ways in which failure and frustration can open the pathways through which we make sense out of life."
5701,sound-and-fury-movie,William Arnold,83,Both intellectually absorbing and emotionally gripping.
5702,the-words-movie,Nathan Rabin,16,"The idiotic melodrama The Words is a maddening contradiction: a film about the publishing industry and a great literary fraud that doesn't have a literary bone in its body or a thought in its pretty, empty little head. "
5703,bats-movie,Marc Savlov,0,It's relentlessly bad in a way that just makes those theatre seats plain uncomfortable.
5704,jakob-the-liar-movie,John Patterson,10,"Just avoid this ghastly, insulting farrago at all costs."
5705,the-wings-of-the-dove-movie,Marc Savlov,67,"Achingly gorgeous in almost all respects, the film soars in its period depiction of turn-of-the-century London (and later in Venice, as well), from costuming to cinematography on down."
5706,the-counselor-movie,Jeff Baker,0,"The Counselor is nothing but a dumb, gory, grab-bag of clichés and the biggest waste of talent since ""Savages."" It makes Oliver Stone look subtle."
5707,tully-2018-movie,Gary Thompson,88,"It’s barbed, bighearted, and brave."
5708,im-still-here-movie,Kyle Smith,12,When I'm Still Here reached its climactic moment -- Joaquin Phoenix puking into a toilet -- I had never before felt quite so much like a toilet.
5709,united-93-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"There's just nothing artful about it, and it's Greengrass who deserves the credit. These nonactors don't act the way most people do when playing themselves. They act the way people do when they're being themselves."
5710,blackhat-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,"The narrative core suffers a conspicuous meltdown, though not before Mr. Mann gets to stage a few impressive action sequences, the best and loudest of which concerns a shootout in a curvilinear tunnel. As for the climax, set against a massive torchlight parade through the streets of Jakarta, it’s very elaborate, and terribly dumb."
5711,field-of-dreams-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,30,"The tenuous conclusion is that all this metaphysical hugger-mugger was divinely ordered to reconcile Costner and his father. All those dead players were summoned from that Great Locker Room in the Sky in a painfully false move. [9 May 1989, p.26]"
5712,walt-el-grupo-movie,Joe Williams,75,"While Walt and El Grupo is less than a penetrating analysis, it's more than a Mickey Mouse advertisement."
5713,love-1969-movie,Steven Rea,100,"Amour arrives with plaudits and praise. But this is not hype, it is all deserved. This is a masterpiece."
5714,the-human-centipede-ii-full-sequence-movie,David Edelstein,0,"The movie is a reductio ad absurdum, a sick joke taken to extremes, beginning with a goof on the notion that horror movies inspire copycats and ending with a test to determine whether some people will watch anything."
5715,vanity-fair-movie,Paula Nechak,75,Witherspoon is terrific.
5716,a-thousand-words-movie,Owen Gleiberman,16,"In theory, A Thousand Words should draw on its star's abilities as a physical comedian, but Murphy, miming his order for a triple latte at Starbucks, comes off like Charlie Chaplin on crystal meth; he's strenuously unfunny to watch."
5717,the-year-of-living-dangerously-movie,Michael Blowen,100,"The movie masterfully evokes, through stunning direction and magnificent performances, the heat and passion of desperate people living in desperate times. [18 Feb 1983]"
5718,mrs-doubtfire-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,Now that Robin Williams has been emasculated--dangerously schizoid comic turned into nice-guy movie star--it isn't too surprising that a commercial hack like Chris Columbus would use him the way he does in this cutesy 1993 comedy: cutting between Williams trying on different voices rather than holding the camera on him as he lurches between these voices without notice.
5719,bellflower-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,75,Bellflower has plenty of rough edges and it suffers from a bad case of hipper-than-thou-ness. But it's a triumph.
5720,sleeping-with-other-people-movie,Marc Mohan,75,"Sleeping with Other People turns out to be more entertaining than it sounds. The movie, that is."
5721,the-boondock-saints-ii-all-saints-day-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,30,"Although the Tarantino influence still is tangible, this time around Duffy reveals himself to also be a big Francis Ford Coppola fan, but the cartoonish end result plays like ""Godfather III"" meets the Three Stooges."
5722,mindhunters-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"So stupid it makes ""xXx: State of the Union"" look like it was written by Nietzsche."
5723,harry-is-here-to-help-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"Moll, in only his second feature, evokes a sense of foreboding, playing the routine against the unnerving, the humorous against the sinister, with a wit and deftness that might have impressed Hitchcock."
5724,dont-move-movie,Deborah Young,80,"In his second outing as a director, top thesp Sergio Castellitto (also playing the surgeon) takes the viewer on an emotion-filled ride and brings a violently masculine perspective to the story. However, it is Penelope Cruz who gives the film's knockout performance."
5725,the-fantastic-four-movie,Marc Mohan,25,This is the Fantastic Four. Maybe someday they'll get to act like it.
5726,american-psycho-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"Most of American Psycho just sits there, looking at trouble, rather than looking for it - complacent, overjoyed in fact to exist at all."
5727,uncle-boonmee-who-can-recall-his-past-lives-movie,Keith Uhlich,100,"What you see and hear always seems perfectly natural, even if you can't exactly say why. Who needs words when you have cinema?"
5728,the-avengers-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"It's a completely botched effort -- botched in its direction, its writing and editing.	"
5729,lawrence-of-arabia-re-release-movie,Andy Klein,100,"Released in 1962, it was pretty clearly the most intelligent spectacular within living memory. On its 40th anniversary, it's even better."
5730,looking-for-comedy-in-the-muslim-world-movie,Peter Travers,63,"This Brooks is a comedian who forgets the golden rule of ""know your audience."" He thinks he'll get his laughs if he keeps doing the same act with better lighting."
5731,the-last-witch-hunter-movie,Robert Abele,30,"The Last Witch Hunter is one of those artlessly restless, exposition-dialogue fantasy-action slogs that, thanks to Breck Eisner's untamed direction, never manages to corral all the potion talk, mythology rationale and leaps back and forth in time into anything remotely entertaining."
5732,catwoman-movie,Lawrence Toppman,25,"Pitof can be blamed for the 89-cent digitized sets, the jerky or rubbery special effects, some clunky performances and more continuity errors than I could count."
5733,paul-blart-mall-cop-2-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,What’s most dispiriting about this garbage burger is its nonsensical characterization of Blart himself.
5734,the-salt-of-the-earth-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"The Salt of the Earth deals with two kinds of journeys the photographer made. The outward one may have literally taken him to the furthest corners of the Earth and resulted in the stunning images the film features, but it is the inward journey that paralleled it that completely holds our attention."
5735,zoolander-2-movie,Richard Roeper,38,"Stiller the director does a fine job of making Zoolander 2 look like an actual spy movie, but we’ve seen far better takeoffs, including “Spy” and “Kingsman: The Secret Service” in just the last couple of years. As for the jabs at the transient nature of popular culture and the ridiculousness of high fashion world — easy, tired targets."
5736,the-white-ribbon-movie,J. Hoberman,100,"Detailed yet oblique, leisurely but compelling, perfectly cast and irreproachably acted, the movie has a seductively novelistic texture complete with a less-than-omniscient narrator."
5737,view-from-the-top-movie,Rick Groen,25,View from the Top never gets off the bottom -- comedies don't come much flatter.
5738,the-emperors-new-groove-movie,Frank Lovece,90,A comic masterpiece.
5739,summer-catch-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"The equivalent of a full-course meal with no calories. It is a mirage of a movie, 100 minutes of nothing."
5740,i-melt-with-you-movie,Rex Reed,0,"A disastrous catalog of flaws, all accentuated by dilated, out-of-focus cinematography. The coke-snorting, booze-guzzling and vomiting add up to nearly two hours of frustration, anesthesia and pointless, self-indulgent excess. They should have called it ""I Vomit With You."" There's plenty of that too."
5741,the-greatest-showman-movie,John Semley,0,"It's an empty, moronic, pandering and utterly forgettable, low-rent ""Moulin Rouge"" that pays curious tribute to Barnum by similarly hailing its audience as slack-jawed rubes, slobbering for whatever passes as entertainment. It's godawful."
5742,the-clapper-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,10,"Mashing limp romance and artless satire into a ludicrously contrived plot, The Clapper lurches from one mirthlessly eccentric scene to another."
5743,who-is-cletis-tout-movie,Laura Sinagra,10,"This charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make ""Jay and Silent Bob's Excellent Adventure"" seem understated."
5744,the-free-state-of-jones-movie,A.O. Scott,80,"Mr. Ross consulted some of the leading experts in the era...and has done a good job of balancing the factual record with the demands of dramatic storytelling. The result is a riveting visual history lesson, whose occasional didacticism is integral to its power."
5745,the-wedding-movie,James Berardinelli,38,It's tired and dated with too few laughs to justify the stultifying attempts at drama and the impossible-to-swallow plot contortions. 
5746,silkwood-movie,Michael Blowen,100,"Fueled by Meryl Streep's performance in the title role, energized by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen's script and tempered by Mike Nichols' understated direction, Silkwood is a brilliant movie that puts art above polemics, and the facts above speculation. [14 Dec 1983]"
5747,an-affair-of-love-movie,Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan,88,"A passionate, heart-wrenching film that is a must-see for any romantic."
5748,dalida-movie,Roger Moore,38,"The title performance, the awful lip-syncing, the utter lack of stage presence, cripples this movie in ways no mere maudlin cover of “Nights in White Satin” in Italian could."
5749,enter-the-dragon-movie,Pauline Kael,80,"The slender, swift Bruce Lee was the Fred Astaire of martial arts, and many of the fights that could be merely brutal come across as lighting-fast choreography."
5750,the-edge-of-seventeen-movie,Daniel Schindel,75,The Edge of Seventeen isn’t John Hughes for a new generation – it’s much more honest than that.
5751,bully-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,A truly repulsive piece of trash that says far more about the absence of values from contemporary filmmaking than the waywardness of teens.
5752,that-awkward-moment-movie,Robbie Collin,20,"Tom Gormican, the writer and director, mostly uses overlapping dialogue in place of actual jokes, although occasionally he stretches to toilet humour."
5753,sleeper-movie,Tom Cox,80,"With a dearth of psychoanalysis, the jazzy pace barely lets up, but the result - essentially an Allen stand-up show that just happens to be set in the middle of a fascistic, architecturally stunning future society - is no less seminal for its slapstick ebullience: a lesson that the pursuits of making art and making a complete idiot out of yourself are not mutually exclusive."
5754,blind-date-1987-movie,Sheila Benson,10,"What boggles the mind is how this bit of navel lint could have seemed even remotely funny to anyone at any stage along its way. Even as a low moment in high concept, it is inconceivable that someone would undertake to make this into a film."
5755,mystery-science-theater-3000-the-movie-movie,Richard Schickel,80,"As the gags pile up remorselessly, and the viewer strains to keep up with the story line and the cutting subtext, a furious but benign apnea takes hold. You can't enjoy a good long laugh because you'll miss too much. It's the happiest form of internal injury."
5756,300-rise-of-an-empire-movie,David Hiltbrand,63,Israeli director Noam Murro does an excellent job of managing and expanding the franchise established so vividly by Zach Snyder.
5757,teachers-pet-movie,Richard Corliss,90,"Has a whirligig wit, and 11 songs crammed into its 67 minutes: that's more melodic content than in most Broadway musicals."
5758,may-movie,Kevin Thomas,80,"A stylized work of unflinching control and discipline, reflecting an artistic maturity unusual in a first film."
5759,rollerball-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,0,"As in the comparatively quaint original film, there are whiffs of greed, carnage, social upheaval and the triumph of the numskull, but it's all rendered noxious nonsense by zooming hot rods, vague T&A, irritating jump-cuts and a bunch of dipshit Power Ranger wannabes slamming in hell's moshpit."
5760,mamma-mia!-movie,Anthony Lane,30,Ferocious onslaught of obligatory good cheer.
5761,thats-my-boy-movie,Nathan Rabin,16,"The film is such a barren comic wasteland of scatology and misogyny that Vanilla Ice steals the film with a good-natured, self-deprecating portrayal of himself as Sandler's sleazy party buddy. "
5762,a-map-of-the-world-movie,Jay Carr,75,"Gives three first-rate actors a chance to stretch, and they do."
5763,star-wars-the-clone-wars-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,George Lucas is turning into the enemy of fun.
5764,swiri-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"In recent years, South Korean cinema has fully flowered, producing both uncompromising highly personal films and crisp, intelligent genre movies, with Shiri the most spectacular example of the latter to date."
5765,lara-croft-tomb-raider-the-cradle-of-life-movie,Michael Atkinson,0,It wouldn't be fair to gripe about the hundreds of plot holes; the whole thing is hole.
5766,point-blank-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"Frantic, violent and unrelenting, it is all of a piece, its tightly packed storytelling making cassoulet of its own implausibilities and familiar terrain covering a web of political and institutional conspiracy."
5767,the-magdalene-sisters-movie,Desson Thomson,90,Mullan's movie is admiringly uncompromising. He refuses to augment the horrors with relief. 
5768,boat-trip-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"If Boat Trip were screened on a cruise ship, most of the passengers would be dog-paddling back to shore."
5769,struck-by-lightning-movie,Chris Cabin,0,"A class-five pity party so unbearably condescending and unconvincing that it might just make you run out and buy an ""I'm With Mitt"" t-shirt, it makes an inadvertent but hugely compelling pro-bullying argument. "
5770,enchanted-april-movie,Joe Pollack,100,"Enchanted April, from von Arnim's novel, may be the most charming film I've seen all year. Not only is it charming, but also witty, literate and bitingly funny. Then, without losing those qualities, it becomes a warm and wonderful love story, about dreams coming true, and finding what was thought lost, both in oneself and in someone else. [28 Aug 1992]"
5771,happy-endings-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,70,"A real audience pleaser, so long as that audience is mentally agile and adult, for it comes at you from odd angles and features three distinct story lines and 10 main characters."
5772,the-bitter-pill-movie,Scott Tobias,83,"Like his underappreciated ""Haywire,"" Side Effects screws around in its own thriller architecture, toying with feints of structure and clever bits of misdirection, and otherwise playing the audience like a fiddle. At this point in his career, Soderbergh pulls it off with the unpracticed ease of a maestro."
5773,trekkies-movie,Leonard Klady,70,A largely affectionate look at the weird and the wonderful subculture that's ensued and endured since the sci-fi series first beamed up in 1966.
5774,the-final-year-movie,Frank Scheck,80,It’s the little moments that provide the most fascination.
5775,bridge-to-terabithia-movie,Angie Errigo,80,"A thoroughly pleasing family film with fine performances and honest, affecting real situations mixed with joyful adventure."
5776,almost-famous-movie,David Ansen,80,"Though acid is dropped, groupies are bartered like poker chips and rock-star egos flare like fireworks, what comes through is the relative innocence of that era."
5777,far-and-away-movie,Rick Groen,0,It's just a shrunken case of large-screen aspirations wedded to a small-screen mentality. [22 May 1992]
5778,birth-movie,Ella Taylor,30,"Birth may be the most futile application of cinematic and acting skill I've seen all year. A little ""Twilight Zone"" flummery would have livened up the proceedings to no end. "
5779,legally-blonde-2-red-white-blonde-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Takes the financially successful formula of ""Legally Blonde,"" the Reese Witherspoon hit from two years ago, and does something unexpected. It fiddles with it, changes it and actually fixes it."
5780,last-weekend-movie,Drew Hunt,25,The filmmakers are content to idealize everyone's unchecked narcissism and idle privilege--an inquiry-free recipe for disaster in an age when the American wealth gap is wider and more detrimental than ever. 
5781,white-noise-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,"It's yet another warm, fuzzy, New-Age tale that cozies us into believing the grave doesn't mean oblivion."
5782,runaway-vacation-movie,Marc Savlov,0,Isn't it time to put Robin Williams out to pasture? There's precious little mirth to be had via RV after the comically nasty opening set-up.
5783,the-rules-of-attraction-movie,Carla Meyer,25,"Nearly every bodily fluid makes an appearance in ""Rules,"" a mean-spirited paean to hedonism set at an East Coast college where students attend class only occasionally, and then only to perform oral sex on instructors."
5784,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,David Ansen,0,"If you harbor any fond feelings for the original, stay far away from this mess."
5785,fanboys-movie,Robert Wilonsky,20,"The one genuine bright spot among the performers is Kristen Bell as Windows's would-be girlfriend, his dream combination of Sarah Michelle Gellar and Janeane Garofalo."
5786,groundhog-day-movie,Louis Black,67,There were a lot of ways for this film to go stupid; it succumbs to none of them.
5787,the-fp-movie,Nick Schager,38,"The FP has a one-note joke of a conceit, and when that runs out, it has few actual jokes to fill the humorless void."
5788,nextdayair-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"Might make a terrific double bill with the equally inane (but considerably more entertaining) ""Con Air,"" with the French electonica duo Air chirruping in the background. But, you know, only if you're stoned out of your head."
5789,dust-to-glory-movie,Peter Hartlaub,75,"There are more over-the-top moments, but they never last long. And after every groan-inducing piece of footage, a spectacular near-crash or daring motorcycle chase comes along to leave the movie's shortcomings in a cloud of dust."
5790,mute-movie,Roger Moore,38,"If this is what the excruciating finished film looks like, what manner of dreck must Mr. Bowie’s son have left on the cutting room floor?"
5791,blame-it-on-rio-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"Blame It on Rio, ha. Rio is innocent. Let's put the blame on executive producer Gelbart along with Caine and Bologna. Unlike the starlettes they've taken in tow, these three guys are old enough to know better."
5792,sarah-palin-you-betcha!-movie,Karina Longworth,30,"For all the legitimate reasons to jeer Palin, should her rightful wariness of Broomfield's camera be one of them? "
5793,new-years-eve-movie,Richard Larson,12,"The lesson to learn from watching Garry Marshall's New Year's Eve, a predictably insufferable, self-congratulatory cash cow designed to be ingested and then happily discharged without a second thought by gullible moviegoers who just don't know any better, is that we live in a time without economic dignity, a time in which we must be ready to do just about anything for a paycheck. "
5794,cold-creek-manor-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,20,It's discouraging to witness a filmmaker who clearly yearns for the indie world yield to the temptations of mindless movie manufacturing. At least Figgis made it as soulless as possible.
5795,for-colored-girls-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"With such a large cast, none of the actors is able to turn her character into a fully realized person."
5796,simply-irresistible-movie,Stephen Hunter,0,"The dialogue is fast but bad, the acting is loud but awful and the morality is chaste but unromantic. As for the food, it looks vulgar."
5797,nobody-knows-movie,David Edelstein,90,Pure and universal.
5798,felicias-journey-movie,Kevin Thomas,80,One of the year's riskiest yet most effective films.
5799,my-friend-dahmer-movie,April Wolfe,90,"My Friend Dahmer is both sensitive and fascinating, distinguished by a stellar, mouth-breathing performance of insecurity from Lynch."
5800,a-most-violent-year-movie,Eric Kohn,83,The filmmaker is ultimately better at constructing nuanced environments and troubled figures than making every piece of the equation gel as a whole. But that's a minor issue in the overall tapestry of Chandor's carefully designed world.
5801,cecil-b-demented-movie,Michael Atkinson,8,Appears to have been written and directed by a grade-school dropout snorting airplane glue.
5802,killer-joe-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"A sleazy and pointless film about sleazy and pointless people, Killer Joe reminds us that what Quentin Tarantino does isn't easy."
5803,city-of-god-movie,Keith Phipps,100,"The film finds a surprising amount of tenderness and humor beneath the brutality. The laughs may catch in the throat, but that's only a byproduct of City Of God's power to leave viewers breathless."
5804,the-hottie-the-nottie-movie,James Berardinelli,12,A cinematic excursion so horrific that it's an insult to bad movies to call it a bad movie.
5805,the-aviator-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"The Aviator, though, if not prime Scorsese, is the closest thing in a long time to the old Scorsese. What a splendid year-end gift!"
5806,city-slickers-ii-the-legend-of-curlys-gold-movie,Christopher Harris,12,"Crystal has a likable screen persona, and he's gracious in sharing his stage, but the movie is essentially an expensive (if quite possibly profitable) act of self-indulgence. [10 June 1994]"
5807,the-princess-and-the-warrior-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"Spellbinding on its own terms, a modernist fable with a madly romantic soul."
5808,dungeons-dragons-movie,Paul Malcolm,10,"A cheap ""Star Wars"" rip-off with swords instead of light sabers."
5809,the-big-uneasy-movie,Shawn Levy,75,"At once breezy and substantial, but it could have been more powerful if it were, paradoxically, sharper and blunter."
5810,rescue-dawn-movie,Scott Bowles,63,"This is all about escape. And as prison-break movies go, Rescue ranks among the best."
5811,black-water-movie,Katie Walsh,10,"Everything about this movie seems ripped from the ’80s, including the woefully sexist gender politics. But that’s only one of many reasons that this B-movie dreck should have stayed underwater."
5812,new-york-i-love-you-movie,Joe Williams,63,"Neither a comprehensive guide nor consistently good, but because the theme is romance, most of these small bites of the Big Apple are easy to digest."
5813,wild-target-movie,Leslie Felperin,20,"Nearly every element here is wildly off-target, from Jonathan Lynn's (""The Whole Nine Yards"") lazy helming and Lucinda Coxon's shambolic script to the embarrassed-looking perfs from usually excellent lead thesps Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt. "
5814,john-wick-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"John Wick serves up a noxious, clashing blend of hyper-realistic and cartoonish violence. Too bad there's no cinema decontaminating service that can wash our memories clean of such useless gore."
5815,yoo-hoo-mrs-goldberg-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"In Yoo Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg, Kempner gives us a balance of artist and alter ego, introducing us to a woman we'd like to know even better."
5816,paris-movie,Ty Burr,63,The best armchair holiday going - the cast is lovely to behold and the plot dips in and out of the arrondissements with panache. You almost don’t mind that none of it adds up to terribly much.
5817,scary-movie-5-movie,Laremy Legel,5,"Scary Movie 5 is so massively un-enjoyable, a hate crime against cinema, a ringing indictment of the depths commercialism will go to in search of the lowest common denominator. "
5818,mondovino-movie,Brendan Bernhard,70,"Will get you thinking about wine, and what is and isn't important about it."
5819,the-majestic-movie,Charles Taylor,10,One of those movies that makes you feel as if the national IQ was dropping while you're watching it. It's the return of all the homiletic clichés about an America that never existed.
5820,blue-car-movie,Nicole Arthur,80,"Bruckner's Meg is that rarity, a credible screen teenager."
5821,the-messenger-the-story-of-joan-of-arc-movie,Edward Guthmann,25,"Isn't some sober history lesson that bogs down in long speeches and tedious facts. It's about style, it's about fashion, it's about rock 'n' roll busting out in medieval France."
5822,in-praise-of-love-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,10,"Rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this --  it's pretty shocking that this thing isn't even artsy. Barring a few brief moments of instantaneously fizzling inspiration, it's merely fartsy."
5823,dungeons-dragons-movie,Cody Clark,30,"Gamer geeks, I speak your language! And I warn you: Flee! Or, at the very least, crank down any expectations you harbor -- a few notches below ""zero"" should do it -- before buying a ticket."
5824,shattered-glass-movie,Ella Taylor,70,Far and away the strongest performance in Shattered Glass is Peter Sarsgaard’s.
5825,the-life-of-david-gale-movie,Rita Kempley,10,Another tediously sanctimonious message movie from Alan Parker.
5826,mother-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,An absolutely phenomenal film by the Korean director Bong Joon-ho.
5827,independence-day-movie,Mike Clark,88,"A rousing state-of-the-art cartoon capped by an aerial-combat climax that, to its credit, isn't anti-climactic. [2 July 1996, p.D1]"
5828,rize-movie,Peter Debruge,75,"The result is an eye-opening social portrait in the tradition of ""Paris Is Burning,"" the landmark 1990 documentary that introduced drag balls and ''vogueing'' to the mainstream, but it lacks the earlier film's structure and focus."
5829,the-last-face-movie,Glenn Kenny,10,"As well meaning as this movie is, it is also a turgid, muddled one."
5830,the-equalizer-movie,Christopher Gray,38,"All this should build up to a moderately engaging battle of wits, but Richard Wenk's script has little interest in wit and no capacity for psychology. "
5831,blade-ii-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,Duller than first version.
5832,the-last-stand-movie,Calum Marsh,88,"One of its most refreshing aspects is its acceptance of both western and action-film conventions on their own terms, refusing to regard itself as operating outside of or superior to the genre."
5833,8-women-2000-movie,Michael Atkinson,16,"Greenaway has hit a brick wall, and it's no fun to watch."
5834,black-knight-movie,Jami Bernard,25,"Dismal time-travel comedy that makes ""Big Momma's House"" look like ""Citizen Kane."""
5835,analyze-that-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"So dull and awful, you actually wonder if this is some kind of Andy Kaufmanesque in-joke, a deliberate attempt to douse the spark that made the original film so enjoyable."
5836,enough-movie,Claudia Puig,38,Too much. The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone.
5837,the-bounty-hunter-movie,Andy Klein,0,"At points, the film sinks below the level of competent."
5838,the-11th-hour-2015-movie,Diego Semerene,12,Writer-director Anders Morgenthaler's film is practically an exercise in over-explication.
5839,the-boy-in-the-striped-pajamas-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,"An appalling, jaw-dropping movie that will cause serious nightmares."
5840,super-fly-movie,Nathan Rabin,83,"Superfly is in many ways classic pulp, but O'Neal and Mayfield push it toward a sort of epic grandeur. "
5841,hail-caesar!-movie,Michael Phillips,63,"The tone of ""Hail, Caesar!"" is even and assured, yet the comic inspiration is sporadic. "
5842,graduation-movie,Jessica Kiang,91,"An excoriating, gripping, intricately plotted morality play, Mungiu’s film is less linear, more circular or spiral-shaped than his previous Cannes titles...but it is no less rigorous and possibly even more eviscerating and critical of Romanian society, because it offers its critique across such a broad canvas."
5843,manderlay-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,"Another ridiculous anti-American screed by the minimalist Danish director Lars von Trier, who has never set foot in this country."
5844,dressed-to-kill-movie,David Ansen,70,"As much as I enjoyed its cheap thrills and its exquisite craft, Dressed to Kill left me wanting something more from De Palma.He has begun to borrow from himself -- one crucial twist is lifted shamelessly from ""Carrie"" -- and his jokey disregard for psychological plausibility (most evident in his disastrous ""Obsession"") is beginning to seem just lazy. It may seem unfair to ask for more depth from De Palma when his surfaces give so much pleasure, but from a director this prodigiously talented one expects miracles. Dressed to Kill takes his series of Hitchcockian homages about as far as they can go. It's exhilarating dead-end moviemaking, and one eagerly awaits his next move. [4 Aug 1980, p.61]"
5845,iron-monkey-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,"A guilt-free, no-fat dessert from start to finish."
5846,patti-cake-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"Ms. Macdonald is quite simply a revelation, capturing the reflexive self-confidence and defensive diffidence of the millennial generation with sneaky sincerity and offhand wit."
5847,the-american-president-movie,Jack Kroll,90,"All this is good fun -- some of which is anticipating the pained reaction from conservative Hollywood-hasslers. Director Rob Reiner has a fine smooth touch, Douglas is charismatic, Bening is scrumptious -- you want to put all these dream politicos in a doggy bag and take them home. [20 Nov 1995, p.28]"
5848,nutty-professor-ii-the-klumps-movie,Wesley Morris,75,"It's a half-life better than Martin Lawrence treading similar, simpler water in ""Big Momma's House."""
5849,code-46-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"Cyberpunk meets renegade romance, à la Orwell."
5850,urban-legends-final-cut-movie,John Petrakis,12,It's hard not to feel angry that you've spent almost two hours watching this moronic exercise.
5851,standard-operating-procedure-movie,Claudia Puig,88,It may be the most disturbing film you'll see in a long time.
5852,bedtime-stories-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"As a PG-rated film opening on Christmas Day under the Disney banner, Bedtime Stories would seem to promise fairly wholesome family entertainment. What it delivers is the glitzy allure of a hotel setting, smarmy double entendres, Ferrari lust, Beverly Hills bling and pneumatic babes -- one of the characters is a surrogate Paris Hilton."
5853,persepolis-movie,Lisa Nesselson,90,This autobiographical tour de force is completely accessible and art of a very high order.
5854,hangman-movie,Craig D. Lindsey,30,"Even with all its grisly, gory absurdity, Hangman actually tries to be a sincere salute to all the badge-wearing men and women who risk their lives on the regular to catch bad guys. But you may not take a single frame of this movie seriously."
5855,ripd-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"For a movie that so strenuously rips off “Ghostbusters” and “Men in Black,” R.I.P.D. manages to come up with fresh new ways of being absolutely terrible."
5856,eight-crazy-nights-movie,Liam Lacey,38,"Both syrupy and scatological, this is a typical family-dividing Sandler comedy: Parents will hate it but the kids will delight in its rudeness."
5857,johnny-english-movie,Claudia Puig,63,"The jokes often are corny or labored, and the story is predictable. However, Atkinson raises the movie to the level of good fun by the force of his outrageous persona and skill at physical comedy."
5858,there-will-be-blood-movie,Maitland McDonagh,75,"Ambitious, deeply flawed and studded with sequences that achieve pure, majestic greatness."
5859,dont-come-knocking-movie,Roger Ebert,63,There are scenes that don't even pretend to work. And others that have a sweetness and visual beauty that stops time and simply invites you to share.
5860,girl-on-a-bicycle-movie,Odie Henderson,12,"The word convoluted does no justice to just how poorly designed Girl on a Bicycle is. It is also stereotypical, unfunny, unromantic, absurd, sitcomish, insulting to several European ethnicities and a slave to what Roger Ebert used to call ""The Idiot Plot Syndrome."""
5861,in-the-loop-movie,Michael Ordona,80,"In the Loop is no precious show dog. It's a snarling, frothing little beastie straining at its leash."
5862,finding-forrester-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,"Not even D.W. Griffith, Steven Spielberg, and Stanley Kubrick working together could succeed in making this pandering piece of nonsense work dramatically on any level except the most egregiously phony."
5863,housebound-movie,Drew McWeeny,100,Housebound is that rare film that manages to be funny without defusing any of its scares.
5864,transformers-the-last-knight-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"This latest entry is simply dumb, dull, and pointless. "
5865,planet-of-the-apes-movie,Marc Savlov,67,"Simply put, Burton's film lacks the social and political gravitas of the original, a film that was wholly of its time."
5866,nadja-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"What could have been a brilliant short becomes deadly, stretched to feature length. The last hour of Nadja takes on the pace of a stranger's vacation video. In a sure sign of desperation, the careful tone of the opening is abandoned in scattershot attempts at cheap laughs. The film's world is undermined, and Nadja gets as precious, smirky and as boring as a Hal Hartley picture. "
5867,gravity-movie,Mike Scott,100,"Gravity, it turns out, is a great film, a technical and storytelling masterpiece that is buoyed by stunning visuals and which functions both as a ripping, tension-filled yarn and as a profound and life-affirming work of art."
5868,ballast-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,90,"Working with non-pro actors, Hammer pulls authentic performances from the trio that are at times almost too painful to witness."
5869,summer-catch-movie,Andy Klein,10,"Given how uninvolving Summer Catch is, the truly remarkable pitching here was not so much on the mound as in the executive office where someone convinced Warner Bros. to green-light this turkey, which should have been called Good Will Hitting."
5870,chronicle-2012-movie,Steven Rea,88,Chronicle is full of smart writing that isn't too smart.
5871,scouts-vs-zombies-movie,Alonso Duralde,20,"Sheridan proves he can still act the crap out of a movie, even when crap is all the movie has to offer."
5872,perfect-stranger-movie,Michael Ferraro,10,Nothing but a perfect waste of a Friday night. Or a Tuesday night. Or any night of the week for that matter.
5873,kill-bill-vol-2-movie,Peter Travers,100,"You'll thrill to the action, savor the tasty dialogue and laugh like bloody hell. "
5874,i-am-michael-movie,Melissa Anderson,30,"Glatze's blog entries are read aloud by Franco, an infamous graduate-degree collector not so long ago, in a voice that suggests poetry-MFA earnestness, horrible acting, or both. "
5875,showgirls-movie,James Berardinelli,12,"This film is like a shiny, red apple that's rotten to the core -- despite slick direction and a glossy sheen, it reeks of decay. Showgirls isn't a good drama, a good thriller, or even good pornography."
5876,man-on-fire-movie,Dana Stevens,30,"This is a time-tested movie con, but rarely has it been deployed so contemptibly. "
5877,yes-man-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,It's even better as a love story that just happens to make you laugh.
5878,paterson-movie,Tim Robey,100,How Jarmusch takes this match-stick house of nothings and fills it with such calm and wisdom is a mystery with only one real answer: he’s an artist.
5879,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Simply put, Battlefield Earth is the worst film I've seen in over 10 years, and believe me, that's saying a lot."
5880,watermark-movie,Walter Addiego,75,"The documentary Watermark is close to the cinematic equivalent of a coffee-table book. It relies heavily on visuals and offers minimal context. The project has a pro-environment feeling, which comes across implicitly, not through browbeating or preaching. "
5881,the-last-of-robin-hood-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"Dashing, handsome and self-deprecating, Kevin Kline was born to play Errol Flynn."
5882,sorority-boys-movie,Loren King,38,The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels.
5883,the-rover-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"There is nothing noble about Eric's mission or about the considerable violence he resorts to to get the job done, but Pearce's willingness to give him an integrity of purpose mixes well with Michôd's intense, controlled direction and his ability to blend unexpected, empathetic character moments with all the killing."
5884,the-fourth-war-movie,Janet Maslin,70,"Mr. Frankenheimer relies on standard touches at times, but he also fills The Fourth War with interesting little asides. "
5885,jcvd-movie,Liam Lacey,75,"Unlike ""Being John Malkovich,"" which JCVD sometimes resembles, there is no secret portal to the star's head; instead, the audience gets a fleeting glimpse through the smeared window of his soul."
5886,the-hobbit-there-and-back-again-movie,Bruce Ingram,88,"Fighting — presented with Jackson’s usual double helpings of visual splendor, emotional oomph and low-key comedy — is what Battle of the Five Armies is all about."
5887,black-swan-movie,Kimberley Jones,89,"This drama-horror hybrid, set within a New York ballet company, strikes a tone more along the lines of the terrifying hallucinatories of Aronofsky's breakout film, ""Requiem for a Dream,"" revisiting, too, favorite themes of monster mommies and female hysteria."
5888,such-a-long-journey-movie,Roger Ebert,88,So rich in atmosphere it makes Western films look pale and underpopulated.
5889,the-look-of-silence-movie,Deborah Young,90,The Look of Silence is perhaps even more riveting for focusing on one man’s personal search for answers as he bravely confronts his brother’s killers.
5890,me-and-earl-and-the-dying-girl-movie,Anisha Jhaveri,100,"Poignant without being melodramatic, overflowing with unforced charm, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl holds a unique appeal that's certain to last."
5891,kick-ass-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"Will I seem hopelessly square if I find Kick-Ass morally reprehensible and will I appear to have missed the point? Let’s say you’re a big fan of the original comic book, and you think the move does it justice. You know what? You inhabit a world I am so very not interested in."
5892,kangaroo-jack-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"Were it not for the involvement of producer Bruckheimer, who has made billions by conning millions into believing they can't live without his celluloid crack, it's doubtful Kangaroo Jack would even exist. As it stands now, the ""movie"" barely exists anyway."
5893,non-stop-2014-movie,Joe Williams,63,Non-Stop: It is what it is.
5894,the-parent-trap-movie,Jean Oppenheimer,80,"An engaging, family-oriented romantic comedy that should appeal as much to fans of the original movie as to viewers unfamiliar with the 1961 Hayley Mills version."
5895,collapse-movie,Scott Tobias,100,"There are many layers to the man and the movie, and it’s hard not to leave the theater shaken."
5896,bad-boys-ii-movie,Michael Wilmington,63,"The kind of movie that gives sequels a bad name, even though, strangely enough, it's better than the 1995 hit that spawned it. "
5897,i-tonya-movie,John DeFore,70,"I, Tonya spins a convincing yarn despite, or maybe because of, its surfeit of unreliable narrators."
5898,28-weeks-later-movie,Derek Elley,90,A full-bore zombie romp that more than delivers the genre goods.
5899,miss-potter-movie,Michael Phillips,63,"A scenic, well-behaved account of Potter's life and times."
5900,underclassman-movie,Ty Burr,12,"Saved from total puff only by the obnoxiousness of its star, who seems to be laboring under the delusion that he's the next Eddie Murphy."
5901,shut-in-movie,Rex Reed,0,We’ve seen it all before in dozens of low-budget slasher movies. This one just has a better cast — dismally wasted and left to seek better employment elsewhere.
5902,the-walking-deceased-movie,Frank Scheck,10,The Walking Deceased is strictly DOA.
5903,conan-the-barbarian-movie,James Berardinelli,75,Those who have an inherent distaste for this sort of entertainment will appreciate Conan the Barbarian's impeccable production values without enjoying the story; most everyone else will be swept away by the film's spectacle.
5904,declaration-of-war-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"In the case of French actress and director Valérie Donzelli's striking and imaginative film Declaration of War, the autobiographical element is so strong that the movie's virtually a docudrama – but a dazzlingly strange docudrama with musical numbers, choreographed interludes and prodigious cinematic verve."
5905,the-ridiculous-6-movie,Richard Roeper,25,The Ridiculous Six is sunk by a terrible script by Sandler and Tim Herlihy and some truly cringe-inducing work by a few of the players.
5906,hoffa-movie,William Arnold,83,The film tells the story of Jimmy Hoffa in a refreshingly honest way. [25 Dec 1992]
5907,ride-along-2-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"To call Ride Along 2 rubbish is unfair to rubbish, which at some point had a purpose."
5908,pretty-in-pink-movie,Staff (Not Credited),88,"The movie made me so happy, and here I am back on the subway with Nerdo, and there's this jerk across the aisle who's like ancient, 30 at least, and he's got the nerve to look right into my see-through Madonna lace outfit. And he winks. Oh, barf- ola."
5909,gotti-movie,Johnny Oleksinski,0,I’d rather wake up next to a severed horse head than ever watch Gotti again.
5910,transformers-age-of-extinction-movie,Amy Nicholson,10,"There isn't enough visual beauty to forgive the screenplay's ugliness, but Bay does brave a daring new standard in product placement."
5911,star-wars-episode-vi---return-of-the-jedi-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"Best of all, a revisit with Jedi makes a viewer appreciate spectacle, presentation, mythology -- that, and the power of a bitchin' helmet to speak volumes in a language even an alien can understand. [Special Edition]"
5912,gods-own-country-movie,David Lewis,100,"A stirring romance between an emotionally stifled sheep farmer and an irrepressible Romanian migrant worker, isn’t shy about paying homage to the classic “Brokeback Mountain,” but in many ways, this British film turns out better."
5913,anchorman-the-legend-of-ron-burgundy-movie,Michael Sragow,88,"To discover why movie fans are screaming for more Will Ferrell, and to savor the work of improv wizards like Carell, go see Anchorman."
5914,georgia-rule-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"Just what we need least: a warm family comedy about child molestation.That's Georgia Rule, which combines battleship actresses of the ""Steel Magnolias"" variety, fall-down-go-boom comedy that was obsolete in the '30s, Lindsay Lohan's cleavage and intergenerational fondling just for kicks."
5915,casino-royale-movie,Shawn Levy,75,"See Casino Royale for a Bond you've never seen before, and then imagine him in a film two-thirds the size. Here's hoping the writers of the next Bond movie employ the same personal trainer that Craig did to keep the script tight and lean."
5916,baby-driver-movie,Moira Macdonald,88,"It’s uncannily choreographed, with gestures and movements timed precisely to the soundtrack’s beat."
5917,dreamer-inspired-by-a-true-story-movie,Joe Morgenstern,70,"Here's a case of clichés transmuted, for the most part, into stirring entertainment."
5918,10-items-or-less-movie,Nathan Lee,30,10 Items or Less is a case study in cluelessness.
5919,lords-of-dogtown-movie,Marc Savlov,78,Works best when it seems like it's not working at all.
5920,vampires-kiss-movie,Hal Hinson,20,"Stone-dead bad, incoherently bad... Cage acts as if he has been taking hits off of Dennis Hopper's gas mask. There's no way to overstate it: This is scorched-earth acting -- the most flagrant scenery chewing I've ever seen."
5921,time-bandits-movie,Gary Arnold,100,"Time Bandits is a marvelous cinematic tonic, a sumptuous new classic in the tradition of time-travel and fairy-tale adventure. [06 Nov 1981, p.C1]"
5922,citizen-kane-1941-movie,Peter Bradshaw,100,"Sublime moments, of which the most extraordinary must still be Everett Sloane, playing Kane's former business manager Mr Bernstein, remembering the girl in the white dress on the Jersey ferry: ""I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all – but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl."" I'll bet a week hasn't gone by when I haven't thought about that line and pictured the girl so clearly that she has become a false memory of the movie itself."
5923,ong-bak-movie,V.A. Musetto,0,Having root-canal surgery would be less painful than sitting through the martial-arts disaster Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior.
5924,top-five-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,"With Top Five, Rock has finally made the transition to true movie stardom."
5925,waking-up-in-reno-movie,John Patterson,20,"Director Jordan Brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors -- particularly Theron, a very game and able comedienne -- by shoving them into every clichéd white-trash situation imaginable."
5926,the-woman-in-the-fifth-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,A sluggish and murky sub-Polanski-esque psychodrama.
5927,hoodwinked-too!-hood-vs-evil-movie,Todd McCarthy,10,One of the most obnoxious and least necessary animated films of the century thus far.
5928,bright-movie,Peter Debruge,90,"This ambitious, yet astonishingly well-executed Netflix tentpole directly benefits from the way Ayer’s gritty, streetwise sensibility grounds Landis’ gift for creating an elaborate comic-book mythology."
5929,the-sweetest-thing-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"So badly written, so poorly directed and performed, and so garishly visualized -- attention Kmart shoppers! -- it defies explanation."
5930,carrie-1976-movie,Pauline Kael,100,"The best scary-funny movie since ""Jaws"" - a teasing, terrifying, lyrical shocker, directed by Brian De Palma, who has the wickedest baroque sensibility at large in American movies. Pale, gravel-voiced Sissy Spacek gives a classic chameleon performance as a repressed high-school senior."
5931,what-we-do-in-the-shadows-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,80,"What might seem unlikely to endure beyond standard sketch length proves surprisingly resilient in the hands of directors Clement and Waititi, the team responsible for the equally droll ""Flight of the Conchords."""
5932,harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,90,It's definitely an enchanting spectacular for Potter fans anxious to ride the Hogwarts Express toward a new year of magic and mischief.
5933,game-night-movie,Leah Greenblatt,83,"McAdams, whose comedic skills have gone unsung for way too long, is dizzy fun. The whole movie is, actually, even if it pretty much evaporates on impact — a kooky, vicarious loop of Mad Libs meets Cards Against Humanity, where whoever’s holding the popcorn last wins."
5934,the-hottie-the-nottie-movie,Dennis Harvey,0,"Paris Hilton has already ushered a remarkable three features into the Internet Movie Database's ""Bottom 100."" The Hottie and the Nottie will make it an even four."
5935,smoke-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"Despite a certain grace in the dialogue and casual plot construction, this is positively reeking of a desire to be cheerful in the face of adversity."
5936,what-maisie-knew-movie,Roger Moore,88,"Young Onata Aprile makes Maisie a passive wonder, a sweetly poker-faced, nonjudgmental and hopeful child, even as she’s being ditched at bars, forgotten at school or passed back and forth like a prize, or a bad penny."
5937,disgrace-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,75,"Newcomer Jessica Haines is transparent and heartbreaking as the prof's unorthodox daughter, a victim of violence as the old ways crumble."
5938,we-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"There is little human interest or excitement. It isn't written that way. The music and the dialogue seem curiously even and muted, and there aren't the kinds of drama we expect in a biopic. Everyone is too restrained and discreet to expose themselves that way. "
5939,la-fille-sur-le-pont-movie,Lisa Nesselson,100,The gleefully assured tale of a professional knife-thrower who finds a quirky new target... hits the bull's-eye.
5940,the-runaways-movie,Steve Persall,83,"The Runaways isn't just about rock 'n' roll; it IS rock 'n' roll, as loud, sexy, sometimes sloppy and ultimately exhilarating as the music can be."
5941,hobo-with-a-shotgun-movie,Rex Reed,0,"Quite the most appalling piece of junk I have seen lately, Hobo With a Shotgun just lies there like an autopsy."
5942,monkey-kingdom-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,80,"The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining."
5943,mission-impossible-fallout-movie,Dan Jolin,100,"McQuarrie also builds on the last film’s self-aware level of wit and, most importantly, its set-piece-crafting sophistication. No action sequence is allowed to peter out, or be chopped to ribbons in the edit, or lean on the crutch of CG augmentation."
5944,dark-water-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,"As a sheer ghostly thriller, it's mostly a spell-binder, but I was disappointed at the ending."
5945,indecent-proposal-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,"With a shamelessly cliched script by Amy Holden Jones (based on a novel by Jack Engelhard) that includes a speech plagiarized from Citizen Kane, the results are only for those who can take fare like ""Valley of the Dolls"" with a straight face and want to see Redford play Jay Gatsby again."
5946,fifty-shades-freed-movie,Allison Shoemaker,16,"Give or take one excellent joke about the practical applications of handcuffs — delivered with expert awkwardness by Dakota Johnson, who remains the only moderately charming element of the trilogy — the film is as devoid of wit as it is of subtlety, and that combined absence, courtesy of screenwriter Niall Leonard, leads to some of its biggest unintentional laughs."
5947,adam-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"The tendency for an actor in a role like this is to overact. The result is often disastrous, reducing a character into a caricature. Hugh Dancy, adopting an American accent as effectively as the mannerisms of someone on the moderate portion of the Asperger's spectrum, makes Adam believable and generally sympathetic."
5948,ripd-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"In R.I.P.D., we have a legitimate train wreck of a motion picture: a film that doesn't work on any level. It's not funny. It's not exciting. It's not engaging. It's a waste of time and money."
5949,movie-43-movie,David Edelstein,0,It's rare to see a piece of sh that actually looks and sounds like a piece of sh. It's kind of exciting! 
5950,happy-tears-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"A cringe-inducing, self-consciously kooky indie comedy that's best enjoyed for its taste of Rip Torn."
5951,war-machine-movie,Peter Debruge,30,"Everyone has a different idea of what’s funny, but it’s hard to imagine anyone being amused by War Machine, a colossally miscalculated satire."
5952,magic-in-the-moonlight-movie,Inkoo Kang,20,"Emma Stone couldn't be more charming, but her on-screen romance with Colin Firth couldn't be more contrived or ickiliy age-inappropriate."
5953,the-disappearance-of-eleanor-rigby-them-movie,Scott Foundas,70,"At its core is a most affecting portrait of two people who love each other, but may no longer be able to live as one, and it is mostly a pleasure to spend two, or three, or five hours in their company."
5954,madelines-madeline-movie,Chuck Bowen,75,"True to the implications of its title, the devotional insularity of Madeline's Madeline is suffocating, which is appropriate for a film about a mentally imbalanced teenage artist but suffocating nonetheless. "
5955,push-movie,Wesley Morris,38,"At the very least, a movie like this requires coherence to stay afloat. Barring that, it needs a star to distract us."
5956,thinner-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,"Instead of exploiting the mystery and dread, or even the comedy, of Billy’s condition, Thinner turns into an excruciatingly low-grade pursuit thriller, with Billy hunting down the old Gypsy sage (Michael Constantine) who put the curse on him."
5957,the-waiting-room-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,This is human drama at its most intense and universal. This is the rare film that can change the way you think and see the world.
5958,runaway-jury-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"With the standard Grisham formula having grown stale after so many books and film versions, Jury introduces ingredients that add zest to the old recipe and, in cinematic terms, open up increased possibilities for intrigue and narrative layering."
5959,bachelorette-movie,Peter Travers,63,"Headland can write zingers that would make the cruelest bridezilla blush. And Caplan's treatise on the art of the blow job is time-capsule worthy. Sadly, Bachelorette is a comic cocktail that goes heavy on the bitters. That's no way to end a wedding."
5960,coraline-movie,Richard Corliss,70,"This is the animated film as art film. Coraline doesn't try to ingratiate; it just looms, like a cemetery gate, daring curious souls to tiptoe in and fend for themselves."
5961,live-with-it-movie,Rick Groen,88,"Even hardened cynics will embrace the cliché – yep, you will laugh, you will cry. "
5962,were-the-millers-movie,Steve Persall,67,"The fun of watching We're the Millers is guessing how raunchily low it will go, and realizing you've sorely underestimated these writers and actors."
5963,friends-with-kids-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"It's shrill in tone, awash in unexamined narcissism - kids are just pretexts for laughs, rather than objects of love - and afflicted by explosive verbal diarrhea. There's simply no base line of normal human activity, let alone intimacy, until the anticouple finally re-examines their anticommitment credo. By then everyone has been so selfish and dislikable that our commitment to the film is lost. "
5964,repo!-the-genetic-opera-movie,J. Hoberman,10,"The grim finality of the ensuing pietà suggests the last act of Hamlet or, rather, Hamlet 2--so embarrassing that, for the first time, I wanted to avert my eyes from the screen, although that might have also been because Repo! appears to have been shot with a cell phone."
5965,oceans-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"There have, over the years, been a lot of terrific undersea documentaries, but if you want to know what distinguishes this new one, it comes down to a single word: technology."
5966,the-babymakers-movie,Sara Stewart,12,"In a culture where Anderson Cooper is out and gay-inclusive shows like ""Modern Family"" are wildly popular, a dud like Babymakers doesn't even find sticking power in its offensiveness. It just wipes off."
5967,ouija-movie,Kevin C. Johnson,38,"Directed by Stiles White, whose credits lean more heavily in the special-effect arenas, Ouija is bland, safe horror for those who like their scares nonexistent."
5968,still-alice-movie,Deborah Young,90,"The toll the disease takes on the life of a brilliant linguistics professor is superbly detailed by Julianne Moore in a career-high performance, driving straight to the terror of the disease and its power to wipe out personal certainties and identity."
5969,wimbledon-movie,Carrie Rickey,63,A slick comedy that's more fun than it has any right to be.
5970,fifty-shades-darker-movie,Amy Nicholson,67,"The movies aren't so bad they're good. They're so brilliantly bad they're genius, with Foley dutifully presenting every inane plot point while gifting us excuses to laugh."
5971,rugrats-go-wild-movie,Lawrence Toppman,12,"It's an uncoordinated, flailing hodgepodge of music videos, chases, crashes and moronic plot twists."
5972,coriolanus-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"In lesser hands, this could have easily been some seriously detestable John Wayne jingoism. But via Fiennes, the film is a spiky and complex counterweight to Hollywood sentiment and indie cynicism alike."
5973,cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-movie,Keith Phipps,75,"It’s a brisk, bright, winning effort, even though it already looks sadly out of touch with the times."
5974,dead-man-walking-movie,Gene Siskel,100,"Sarandon delivers one of her very best performances; her shock at encountering the wrath of the victim's family is registered beautifully. And Sean Penn, who for too long has suffered with the label of being a ""bad boy,"" gives an Oscar-caliber performance.[12 January 1996, Friday, p.B]"
5975,who-is-cletis-tout-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,"Allen is no more convincing than the writer-director, Chris Ver Wiel, who strings together faux-QT, faux-Elmore Leonard clichés like so many necklace beads and pretends that's the same thing as making a movie."
5976,the-heart-is-deceitful-above-all-things-movie,Jack Mathews,25,"This is an execrable movie depicting the improbable events in the life of a young boy being intermittently raised by his crackhead, highway-hookin' mom (actress-director Asia Argento, with a face that makes Courtney Love's mug shot look glamorous), her plumb-nuts evangelical parents and a cartoonishly incompetent West Virginia social system."
5977,the-discoverers-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"Writer-director Schwarz has a lot of fun with this nutty premise. And more important, the twisted dynamics of this particular family ring true."
5978,passengers-2016-movie,John Hazelton,30,"Part space romance, part space thriller and all space corn, Passengers is a messy and unconvincing mash-up that tries to get by on the not inconsiderable charm of stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt. "
5979,the-italian-job-movie,Peter Travers,25,"A triumph for the machines, more proof that we do indeed live in the Matrix. "
5980,harlem-nights-movie,Richard Schickel,10,"The movie veers uneasily from not-funny comedy to not-persuasive melodrama. Murphy forgets that the dialogue in old-fashioned crime pictures was as highly stylized as the settings. In place of sharply polished wisecracks, he gives us the steady mutter of the witless, unfelt obscenities that are the argot of our modern mean streets. [27 Nov 1989, p.88]"
5981,miracle-at-st-anna-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,30,"Odd too, for a film that wants to correct impression anyone had as to the abilities of black U.S. soldier in combat, are the ethnic cliches about Italians and Germans, to say nothing of rednecks."
5982,borat-cultural-learnings-of-america-for-make-benefit-glorious-nation-of-kazakhstan-movie,Ty Burr,100,"A comic put-on of awe-inspiring crudity and death-defying satire and by a long shot the funniest film of the year. It is ""Jackass"" with a brain and Mark Twain with full frontal male nudity."
5983,safe-house-movie,Glenn Heath Jr.,63,It'd be unwise to dismiss Safe House as merely a clone of Tony Scott's manically inclined vision.
5984,far-from-heaven-movie,Dana Stevens,100,"It rediscovers the aching, desiring humanity in a genre -- and a period-- too often subjected to easy parody or ironic appropriation. In a word, it's divine."
5985,pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-mans-chest-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,33,"Yes indeed, Pirates 2.0 is a theme ride, if by ride you mean a hellish contraption into which a ticket holder is strapped, overstimulated but unsatisfied, and unable to disengage until the operator releases the restraining harness."
5986,the-wolfman-movie,Ernest Hardy,30,"A movie that’s full of sound, fury and unintentional camp -- and is still bafflingly inert."
5987,annabelle-movie,Kyle Anderson,0,"For a superior experience, go buy a disturbing-looking doll that says ''Don't go see Annabelle'' when you pull its string."
5988,sucker-punch-movie,Michael Phillips,0,Snyder must have known in preproduction that his greasy collection of near-rape fantasies and violent revenge scenarios disguised as a female-empowerment fairy tale wasn't going to satisfy anyone but himself.
5989,underneath-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"Soderbergh is able to execute his games without pigeonholing his characters. He has made that rare thing, a modern-day noir with feeling."
5990,tims-vermeer-movie,Claudia Puig,88,This thought-provoking documentary addresses the origins of Vermeer's photo-realistic art with all the suspense of a thriller.
5991,fighting-movie,Jordan Burchette,75,"Fighting is a fun, frank and faithful homage to simple inner-city drama."
5992,no-good-deed-2014-movie,Drew Taylor,0,"Somehow, No Good Deed finds a way to be exploitative and creepy wherever it can."
5993,horns-movie,John DeFore,70,"A fable-like horror mystery with strong comic and romantic tendencies, Alexandre Aja's Horns draws on source material by cult scribe (and son of Stephen King) Joe Hill to deliver something much more beguiling than the straighter genre fare (High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes) that made his name."
5994,safelight-movie,Brian Tallerico,12,"Bad movies are common. Shockingly bad movies, ones that are so incompetently conceived and executed as to force one to question how they got made, are less so, despite what Angry Film Twitter might have you believe. Safelight is a jaw-droppingly bad movie, a film that doesn’t have characters or a plot."
5995,the-heat-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"The script's simpleminded shenanigans notwithstanding, the two stars sync up better than their characters do, especially with some rough-and-tumble physical slapstick, resulting in a crude, low-brow audience-pleaser that will hit the funny bones of both performers' fan bases."
5996,ratatouille-movie,David Denby,100,"In Ratatouille, the level of moment-by-moment craftsmanship is a wonder."
5997,we-own-the-night-movie,William Arnold,83,"At its core, it's an exploration of the demands and obligations of brotherly love, staged with honesty, originality and a surprising spark of intelligence."
5998,marci-x-movie,Gene Seymour,30,"Despite the occasional topical reference to President Bush and Sen. Clinton, this movie is, like, so eight years ago, it isn't funny."
5999,human-flow-movie,Robert Abele,90,"The overall effect is of something too large to fully comprehend, yet also too intimately sad to ignore, the kind of dilemma that Ai believes speaks directly to who we are as human beings — that ingrained desire to better ourselves, the right to migrate toward safety and prosperity, and the belief we’ll find solidarity in that quest."
6000,hillarys-america-the-secret-history-of-the-democratic-party-movie,Louis Black,0,"Uninterested in persuasion or education, this third documentary by Dinesh D’Souza is designed to aggressively reinforce prejudices and hostilities among true believing conservatives as it offers a “history” of the deliberately evil, completely corrupt, America-hating Democrats."
6001,what-happens-in-vegas-movie,Michael Sragow,25,"The one actor I wanted more of was Williams, who imbues Jack's dad with a robust, sometimes domineering wiliness that suggests a real person. Of course, these silly, inept filmmakers probably cast him because he plays a good guy and his first name is Treat."
6002,the-avengers-movie,Rick Groen,0,The incomprehensible leads to the inexplicable which ends in the indecipherable.
6003,90-minutes-in-heaven-movie,Gary Goldstein,20,"Although this well-meaning film may appeal to its intended audience on a spiritual level, the result is a sluggish, clinical, largely dreary portrait that tends to mistake trauma for drama."
6004,sleepy-hollow-movie,Steve Simels,70,A triumph of genre filmmaking.
6005,message-in-a-bottle-movie,Todd McCarthy,10,"Dreary, lachrymose and incredibly poky tear-jerker that makes its audience wait and wait and wait until nearly the last second for its jerking."

6009,smashed-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"This is a serious movie about drinking but not a depressing one. You notice that in the way it handles Charlie (Aaron Paul), Kate's husband. He is also her drinking buddy. When two alcoholics are married, they value each other's company because they know they can expect forgiveness and understanding, while a civilian might not choose to share their typical days."
6010,the-brady-bunch-movie-movie,Rita Kempley,70,"The movie is as insistently bubbly as the Bradys themselves, but it does run out of carbonation before the end. ""Bunch"" fans won't mind a bit, while others will be amused by the juxtaposition of the family's wholesome idyll with the harsher realities of life in the '90s, as evidenced by ""Roseanne,"" ""Married ... With Children"" and ""Grace Under Fire."" [17 Feb 1995, p.F01]"
6011,sound-city-movie,Ted Scheinman,63,"Given Dave Grohl's reputation for versatility and good taste, the film's sturdy sense of forward motion may come as no surprise."
6012,for-love-of-the-game-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"It's the most lugubrious and soppy love story in many a moon, a step backward for director Sam Raimi after ""A Simple Plan."""
6013,educating-rita-movie,Janet Maslin,30,"The essentially two-character play has been opened up to the point that it includes a variety of settings and subordinate figures, but it never approaches anything lifelike."
6014,beloved-2011-movie,James Rocchi,25,"Honoré's made better films, and he'll make better films again; the most damning thing you can say about this one isn't that it feels like Honore doing a third-rate imitation of Francois Ozon (""Potiche,"" ""8 Women""), but rather that it often feels like Honoré doing a third-rate imitation of himself. "
6015,paul-movie,Elvis Mitchell,70,"Fortunately, the movie is studded with performances that demonstrate the cast's skills, such as Kristen Wiig's soggy white-bread delusional Christian Ruth."
6016,late-marriage-movie,Kevin Thomas,100,"Late Marriage will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest, most deceptively amusing comedies of the year."
6017,the-sapphires-movie,M. E. Russell,83,"The movie unfolds in the uplifting manner you'd expect, but its real pleasures lie in its terrific '60s pop-soul soundtrack and especially in its frequently funny performances. "
6018,hadewijch-movie,V.A. Musetto,75,"An exploration of the power of religion -- should delight Dumont's fans. For others, it will take a bit of getting used to. The effort will prove to be worthwhile."
6019,tiny-furniture-movie,Roger Moore,63,"Lena Dunham's amusing meander through ""post graduate delirium,"" a relationship comedy about nothing so much as the permanent relationships of family and New Yorker's relationship with space - and the lack of it."

6032,dirty-weekend-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,"If you thought Matthew Broderick looked uncomfortable playing “himself” in “Trainwreck,” wait till you get a load of the actor portraying a married man who wonders if he’s gay in Neil LaBute’s mean-spirited comedy Dirty Weekend."
6033,ive-loved-you-so-long-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,Performances this strong and direction this sensitive make us simply grateful to have an emotional story we can sink our teeth into and enjoy.
6034,cloud-atlas-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Despite some weaknesses, a sense gradually emerges in this film- not just an idea, but a strong feeling mixed with an idea - about the dance of good and evil over time."
6035,the-rider-movie,Gary Thompson,75,"It all adds up to a handsome, engrossing slice-of-life movie with the feel of a Western, inventive and unique. The Rider desegregates a genre that typically presents cowboys and Indians as separate and opposing forces – archetypes unified here in one remarkable individual."
6036,the-shallows-movie,Todd McCarthy,20,"Shallow is a mild word for it. Others would be silly, miscalculated, unconvincing, artless, pandering, hokey, ridiculous. Or just plain awful."
6037,boyhood-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,100,"I love how Boyhood admits that, in certain ways, growing up stinks. Every character has a least one moment in which they have to heed the advice of Corinthians and put away childish things. None of them like it."
6038,your-highness-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,0,"There is little worse in the movie world than a spoof that falls flat on its over-costumed butt, but that's what you get with Your Highness."
6039,a-christmas-carol-movie,Richard Corliss,80,"A ghost story, a bustling action-adventure and an example of the comedy tour-de-farce, in which the star validates his virtuosity by appearing in a plethora of funny disguises."
6040,dear-john-movie,Peter Travers,25,"As for the ladies who think any kind of chick flick is preferable to football, be careful what you wish for."
6041,getaway-movie,Adam Markovitz,16,You will still be astonished by how flat-out awful it is.
6042,miami-vice-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,"If you really must see Miami Vice (and you mustn't), buy a ticket to something better, then slip into ""Vice"" at the 95-minute mark and watch the last third of the movie. No one involved will profit by your curiosity, and you won't miss a thing of importance."
6043,burlesque-movie,Mary Pols,70,"The results, while occasionally forced, are consistently amusing."
6044,monsters-ball-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"This is as anti-Hollywood a film as I have seen in recent months, one which takes conventional plot ideas and uses them not to season a melodrama, but to enrich fully three-dimensional characters and create a forceful motion picture."
6045,getaway-movie,John DeFore,20,Getaway seems built for non-English speaking territories in which dialogue is as disposable as Bulgarian police cars. If only those audiences were as dumb as the action itself.
6046,new-in-town-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,Excruciatingly unfunny.

6049,i-saw-the-devil-movie,Liam Lacey,63,A typical mixture of the artful and the repellent.
6050,revolver-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,The movie's onslaught of psychobabble is the annoyance most likely to ruin your evening. Imagine getting stuck on a ski lift with Dr. Phil for nearly two hours.
6051,american-mary-movie,Sherilyn Connelly,30,"This Canadian film seems to be trying to make some points about body dysphoria or modern fame, but the one point it's absolutely sure of is that [Katharine] Isabelle is a startlingly beautiful woman with a well-proportioned (and exploitable) body."
6052,sils-maria-movie,Rex Reed,75,"The movie moves as slowly as the oncoming fog, but Juliette Binoche is always a pleasure to watch, despite an awkward coda set in London that I found jarring."
6053,the-proposal-movie,Brian Lowry,70,"The Proposal won't catch any bouquets for originality, but in terms of a bended-knee pitch for the affections of women -- including Ryan Reynolds’ boyish charms, a hip granny and even a beyond-adorable puppy -- this romantic comedy pretty much pulls out all the stops."
6054,we-are-marshall-movie,Connie Ogle,75,"Equally thrilling and wrenching, the film is an absolute must for anyone who loves sports and an eloquent explanation for those who don't understand what the fuss is about."
6055,beverly-hills-ninja-movie,Ken Fox,20,Farley -- one of the few comedians who could ever be justly accused of debasing the pratfall -- has made a film that's tantamount to watching an overweight man slip on a banana peel for nearly 90 minutes.
6056,el-cantante-movie,Bill White,75,"A special film, one that refuses to package a person's life into a comfortably familiar genre."
6057,napoleon-dynamite-movie,Marrit Ingman,78,"For older and more reflective viewers, it’s a quirky, fresh slice-of-life more inviting than a tater-tot pyramid."
6058,in-the-shadow-of-the-moon-movie,Reece Pendleton,80,"The astronaut interviews are fun and occasionally moving, but the real reason to see this is the remastered archival footage, some of it previously unseen and all of it spectacular."
6059,a-little-princess-movie,Hollis Chacona,89,"Director Alfonso Cuaron, in his first American movie, has fashioned a world so real and so engaging that you can feel it and smell it and taste it as surely as if you were there."
6060,heartbeats-movie,David Wiegand,75,"Right now, his (Dolan) work is fun to watch. Before long, it may very well be mandatory for anyone who values great filmmaking."
6061,every-thing-will-be-fine-movie,Chuck Bowen,25,"The premise, of a terrible event unleavened by the easy out of someone being at fault, should be prime fodder for Wim Wenders's brand of poetic regret.  "
6062,the-savages-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Both Linney and Hoffman are so specific in creating these characters that we see them as people, not elements in a plot. Hoffman in particular shows how many disguises he has within his seemingly immutable presence; would you know it is the same actor here and in two other films this season, ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" and ""Charlie Wilson's War""?"
6063,runaway-bride-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"Another contrived, unconvincing romantic comedy that once again mixes stale sitcom humor with laughable attempts at pathos and emotional depth."
6064,hail-caesar!-movie,Kate Taylor,25,"In short, there are an awful lot of subplots and comic characters but none of the actors in this star-studded cast is allowed to build his laughs and the Coens just abandon several of these vivid personalities along the way."

6084,sex-lies-and-videotape-movie,Richard Corliss,100,"What amazes is that at just 26, Soderbergh displays the three qualities associated with mature filmmakers: a unique authorial voice, a spooky camera assurance, and the easy control of ensemble acting. [31 July 1989, p.65]"

6087,independence-day-resurgence-movie,David Edelstein,20,This hodgepodge has been thrown together in so slovenly a way that it’s no surprise the studio didn’t show it to the press. 
6088,teddy-bears-picnic-movie,Robert Wilonsky,30,It's utterly frustrating: What could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent.
6089,bright-movie,Jordan Hoffman,10,"There is a whiff of an interesting idea in there, but it is buried in tedious scenes lacking clear direction, endless generic (and poorly lit) shoot-outs, and cringeworthy sequences of allegedly witty banter. This movie is an absolute wreck."
6090,i-heart-huckabees-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Huckabees is godawful, a mirthless, bilious bore in which the vividly focused fury of ""Three Kings"" has become free-floating anger at the follies of human existence."
6091,okja-movie,Jessica Kiang,100,"This is a gorgeously realized popcorn movie of the most satisfying, comforting, restorative kind: full as its heart is, it has a lot on its mind, yet you’d also quite like to curl up on its belly and doze in the sun."
6092,made-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"A peculiarly entertaining comedy, revisits the rapport that Favreau and Vaughn had in ""Swingers"" (1996), and rotates it into a deadpan crime comedy."

6096,capturing-the-friedmans-movie,Rene Rodriguez,100,"This remarkable, continually surprising documentary turns out to be something far richer and more complex, closer in spirit to ""Crumb,"" another devastating film about a family's gradual self-destruction."
6097,men-women-children-movie,Todd McCarthy,80,Jason Reitman's new film skillfully navigates through the personal melodramas of many characters with a nice sense of balance and a sharp appreciation of generational differences.

6100,the-imitation-game-movie,Ty Burr,88,"The film that director Morten Tyldum has made from Hodges’s book is a shinier, less trustworthy thing, but it’s ripping old-school Oscar bait, and if it sends moviegoers off to check the facts, all the better."
6101,play-the-game-movie,Janice Page,38,"Fienberg’s film spends most of its time trying to convince us that true love starts when you stop playing games. Then, in the final minutes, it reverses itself and puts gamesmanship back up on another wobbly pedestal. The result is hard to cheer."
6102,good-hair-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Rock gives Good Hair a rousing message: Where African-Americans in the '60s adopted a ''natural'' look, they now feel free to coif their heads any way they want. That's cultural power."
6103,rabbit-hole-movie,Peter Debruge,80,"Grief may be the topic under examination, but humor -- incisive, observant and warm -- is the tool with which it's dissected in Rabbit Hole, a refreshingly positive-minded take on cinema's ultimate downer: overcoming the death of a child."
6104,the-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"We suspect that the film will be about their various problems and that the hotel will not be as advertised. What we may not expect is what a charming, funny and heartwarming movie this is, a smoothly crafted entertainment that makes good use of seven superb veterans."
6105,bastard-out-of-carolina-movie,Nancy Jalasca Randle,75,"The genetic seeds of John Huston's gift are manifest in his daughter's direction of Carolina. Despite its sorrowful subject, Bastard Out of Carolina offers the deep satisfaction of material that rings true. [15 Dec 1996, p.5]"

6107,gomorrah-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,20,"Clearly, Gomorrah is supposed to represent the best of today’s European cinema...and if this is the best, I would hate to imagine the worst! Gomorrah is a boring mess focusing on how the mob in today’s Naples has its tentacles stretched far and wide"
6108,the-nut-job-movie,Scott Bowles,38,"Despite some high-caliber voice talent and shimmering animation, it's hard to get a bead on this tale."
6109,cars-movie,David Ansen,80,"As eye-popping as anything Pixar has done. But Cars inspires more admiration than elation. It dazzles even as it disappoints. This time around, John Lasseter and his codirector, the late Joe Ranft, seem more interested in dispensing Life Lessons than showing us a roaring good time."
6110,computer-chess-movie,Todd McCarthy,30,"Basically the film consists of a bunch of techies in white shirts and glasses laboriously discussing their views, exchanges you get the feeling the filmmaker thought would come off as humorous."
6111,the-artist-movie,Claudia Puig,100,"Drama, comedy, action and romance are intertwined in this gorgeously photographed and brilliantly directed film. Lead performances are thoroughly engaging despite - or perhaps because of - being wordless."
6112,man-from-reno-movie,Charlie Schmidlin,91,"In noir, nobody is certified as who they claim to be. Boyle magnifies that aspect with a lean and gripping thriller about isolation, strangers, and the consequences of fame that satisfies despite some minor plot bumps. "

6114,crush-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,38,Crush is the kind of movie that gives friendship a bad name.

6117,old-dogs-movie,Andrea Gronvall,0,A total train wreck.
6118,leviathan-movie,Melissa Anderson,100,"Plunging viewers into the thick of chaos, Leviathan explodes the antiquated paradigm of the documentary or ethnographic film, whose mission has traditionally been to educate or elucidate, to create something that seizes us, never letting us forget just how disordered the world is. This may be the greatest lesson any nonfiction film can teach us."
6119,pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales-movie,Oktay Ege Kozak ,70,"Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn’t rewrite the rulebook for the franchise or the genre as a whole, and is wholly predictable from start to finish, but the likable characters—Thwaites and Scodelario have more natural presence and mutual chemistry than Bloom and Knightley—creative action set pieces, and Depp finally being put in his place in the franchise creates a fun ride that’s instantly forgettable. You know, like the ride itself."
6120,room-237-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,"Even these ludicrous notions illustrate the real point of Room 237, as I see it, which is that “The Shining” is a disturbing, complicated and highly unusual creation of pop cinema that works on many levels, and whose slow-acting toxin continues to spread through our cultural veins more than 30 years later."
6121,top-spin-movie,Ronnie Scheib,70,"The film doesn’t so much avoid cliches as brush off any sentimental excess, briskly maintaining narrative flow."

6125,boy-a-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"Like ""Control,"" the recent Anton Corbijn  treatment of rock star Ian Curtis'  short life, the powerful British drama Boy A announces its gravitas with a look--organically achieved, with cinematography, production design and direction working together--you are meant to notice."

6127,what-lies-beneath-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,70,You feel you've been both a little creeped out and vigorously entertained. Its showmanship comes through in the clutch.
6128,hyde-park-on-hudson-movie,Rick Groen,75,"As for Daisy, her inflated role is problematic. Although at the periphery of the action, the woman stands at the centre of the film, doubling as the compromised love interest and our voice-over narrator. But even Linney can't bring her to life."
6129,misery-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"The movie has a real kick to it. As Paul and Annie attempt to outsmart each other, Misery gets nastier and nastier. It turns into a psychotic cat-and-mouse game, and there are some genuine shocks. "

6131,the-divergent-series-insurgent-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Insurgent opens new horizons of repetitiveness, dramatic shapelessness, self-seriousness and a generalized oppressiveness that flows from all of the above as well as from visual clutter, cheerless color, 3-D dimness and plain old bad acting."

6136,monster-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,80,Challenges audiences with an unrelieved portrait of self-destruction and horrific violence. American movies don't get much grimmer than this.
6137,mr-turner-movie,James Berardinelli,75,The film is intricately composed using the shadows created by natural lighting and some of the most astonishing sunsets and landscapes ever captured on screen. Pope's work is immersive and allows viewers to become engaged in a story that occasionally moves a little too slowly. 
6138,alien-covenant-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,"Alien: Covenant is much better than “Prometheus,” in that it has plenty of scares and an actual plot, which, if sometimes predictable — all of these movies are in some ways the ultimate game of survival — is still satisfying."
6139,time-after-time-movie,Pauline Kael,70,"Most of the plotting is ingenious, and soft-faced Mary Steenburgen, as the woman from 20th-century San Francisco who is charmed by the Victorian Wells, makes it all semi-engaging."
6140,a-town-called-panic-movie,Noel Murray,83,"It's more clever than funny, but it's very clever."
6141,a-family-man-movie,John DeFore,10,"A loathsome redemption tale that rings false on every front except when depicting capitalistic assholery (and sometimes fails to convince us even then), Williams' directing debut The Headhunter's Calling (from a script by former corporate headhunter Bill Dubuque) not only expects us to root for its unlovable protagonist, but expects us to do so when that man is played by Gerard Butler."
6142,harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets-movie,Frank Lovece,70,"While this is just as long as the first film, more convincing special effects help make time fly."
6143,gone-in-sixty-seconds-movie,Wesley Morris,75,"A film where suspense and exhilaration are incompatible, and a receding plot line is merely the platform for cars to fly through panes of glass."
6144,harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-movie,Wesley Morris,88,"[Cuaron]'s a visionary and crafty storyteller who rewards your patience, not with twists in the plot, though the movie has its share, but with pure feeling. Deploying wit, grace, and artistry, he's whisked a kid flick into adolescence."
6145,goldfinger-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,"Goldfinger contains more crowd-pleasing moments than any other Bond film, including Oddjob's flying bowler, a laser beam that almost emasculates Bond, the lavishly accessorized Aston Martin DB5, and the bizarre murder of Goldfinger's secretary (Shirley Eaton): she's gilded to death. It also features Shirley Bassey's terrific rendition of the Leslie Bricusse-Anthony Newley title song."
6146,elephant-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,10,A braggart piece of empty exhibitionism. 
6147,a-ghost-story-movie,Jeremy Mathews,89,"A Ghost Story rewards viewers who are willing to engage with it, to accept its evolving premise and experience the expressionless specter’s afterlife as it reveals itself."
6148,lake-placid-movie,Stephen Thompson,20,"It doesn't help that, at 80 or so minutes, it feels like there's a reel missing—you know, the one with the finale that's even slightly more pulse-pounding than any of the four or five other scenes in which the big, impressive-looking monster attacks the heroes as their legs dangle in the water."
6149,wild-movie,Peter Travers,75,"Under the keen-eyed direction of Jean-Marc Vallée (Dallas Buyers Club), Wild emerges as an exciting, elemental adventure that takes you places you don't see coming."
6150,a-good-day-to-die-hard-movie,Laremy Legel,16,"The entire enterprise is a bewildering mess, put in place only to frustrate and alienate anyone who buys a ticket.  Every action scene is telegraphed, and most of the dialogue is irrevocably stupid."
6151,memoirs-of-a-geisha-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"It is a grand-looking, grandly empty pageant."
6152,higher-ground-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"Higher Ground may not be a true revelation, but it does show a viable path an actor might take to shape intelligent material on her own terms."
6153,certain-women-movie,Guy Lodge,100,"As with Reichardt’s more streamlined miniatures, regional detail accounts for much of the film’s lingering resonance, as her characters are molded by (and, in some cases, rail against) the landscape they inhabit. "
6154,tokyo-godfathers-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"This is a first-class film that will appeal to anyone who wants to see a plausible, witty, absorbing human story told well -- indeed, told gorgeously. "
6155,creed-movie,Steven Rea,100,"Creed is corny like the old Rocky films, but riveting like the old Rocky films, too."
6156,the-comedy-movie,David Lewis,0,"The Comedy, one of the most self-indulgent, pretentious and unfunny movies of the year, is a mean-spirited piece of mumblecore that tries to provoke you, but only succeeds in boring you."
6157,man-on-wire-movie,Ty Burr,100,"The sight is magical and heartbreaking in equal measure. Look, the movie says: Where so many would fall, a man walks on air."
6158,what-happens-in-vegas-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"Because its director, Tom Vaughan, brings nothing of interest to the movie, including filmmaking, there isn't anything to say other than to note its insulting ugliness and ineptitude."
6159,deep-impact-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"Mimi Leder shows none of the vigor she exhibited when directing for E.R., and screenwriters Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin betray a real aptitude for hack work."
6160,the-emoji-movie-movie,Danielle White,11,There is virtually nothing in which to emotionally invest. 
6161,the-cell-movie,Wesley Morris,25,"It's mesmerizing nonetheless for its flagrant disregard for narrative, character, pacing, performance and good lighting."
6162,x-men-movie,J. Hoberman,80,"When it comes to stoopid fun, X-Men could be the summer movie to beat."
6163,because-i-said-so-movie,Michael Phillips,38,Formulaic romantic junk.
6164,phantom-halo-movie,Oleg Ivanov,12,A genre mishmash cobbled together from the refuse of disparate visual and narrative modes.
6165,courage-under-fire-movie,James Berardinelli,100,"As profound and intelligent as it is moving, and that makes this memorable motion picture one of 1996's best."
6166,saw-3d-movie,Nick Schager,0,"The film's aim to bring its convoluted saga full-circle through the reappearance of original ""Saw"" victim Carey Elwes merely reeks of desperation, a futile final stab at imparting significance to a creatively bankrupt franchise that need not be resuscitated."
6167,i-spy-movie,Ed Park,30,"Though ample time is spent mingling Murphy's jabberjaw locutions and Wilson's curveball spaciness, the film leaves only the bitter reek of a botched chemistry experiment."
6168,mr-mrs-smith-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,80,"A kicky, twisted thrill ride, with enough laughs to leaven what can be read, at heart, as a metaphor for the modern marriage."
6169,captain-corellis-mandolin-movie,David Edelstein,10,Probably the most horrifying stuff I've seen all week.
6170,el-crimen-perfecto-the-perfect-crime-movie,Kevin Thomas,80,Perfectly delightful.
6171,men-in-black-ii-movie,David Edelstein,0,"If it isn't the worst sequel ever made, it's only because it has too much competition: Impersonal and frenetic, it's a landmark Hollywood disgrace."
6172,she-hate-me-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"She Hate Me manages to be at once racist, homophobic, utterly fake, and unbearably tedious. This time, it's Spike Lee who's doing the bamboozling."
6173,the-adventures-of-robin-hood-re-release-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"Film is done in the grand manner of silent-day spectacles with sweep and breadth of action, swordplay and hand-to-hand battles between Norman and Saxon barons."
6174,sex-with-strangers-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"It's the element of condescension, as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch, that finally makes Sex With Strangers so distasteful."
6175,swept-away-movie,Michael Dequina,10,It certainly didn't take long for Madonna to ruin husband Guy Ritchie's career.
6176,a-hologram-for-the-king-movie,Moira Macdonald,75,This stranger-in-a-strange-land mood piece has an appealingly serene pace. 
6177,serving-sara-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,Crushingly unfunny.
6178,the-good-shepherd-movie,Wesley Morris,63,"Leaves you longing for the other, better political thrillers it evokes."
6179,norman-the-moderate-rise-and-tragic-fall-of-a-new-york-fixer-movie,Gregory Ellwood,83,Cedar’s smart dialogue and direction lift Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer (hereby just referred to as ‘Norman’) above expectations.
6180,seven-pounds-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,"Overall Seven Pounds is too heavy-handed and maudlin to be comprehensible, let alone moving. The real shocker is that not even Smith can rescue it."
6181,the-libertine-movie,Neva Chonin,25,"There is little debauchery to be had in Laurence Dunmore's adaptation of The Libertine. In fact, hedonism has never looked so bleak."
6182,two-for-the-money-movie,Desson Thomson,30,The fight between good and evil feels fixed in favor of Hollywood redemption.
6183,storytelling-movie,Kevin Thomas,80,None of this intellectualizing is necessary to the simple enjoyment of Storytelling -- provided the viewer has a taste for the pitch-black humor that emerges when Solondz's camera becomes a veritable blowtorch aimed at humanity's myriad failings.
6184,everybody-wants-some!!-movie,Peter Travers,88,It'll slap on a smile on your face that won't quit.
6185,where-the-heart-is-movie,Shawn Levy,67,"Had Williams chopped away more pointedly at the rambling script, he might've had something memorable."
6186,surrogates-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Surrogates' morality is less Asimov than asinine, although it's bizarrely reassuring, in a nihilistic sort of way, to believe that in the future, when the world is ready to play The Sims for real (so to speak), our avatars are all going to look like generic porn stars with shitty airbrush jobs."
6187,gimme-shelter-2014-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,12,A happy-smiley Christian fairy tale disguised as a hard-hitting shard of social realism.
6188,left-behind-2014-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,0,"This failed epic — really, an epic failure — would barely be noticed, were it not for former Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage taking on a “Sharknado”-quality remake of a Kirk Cameron movie."
6189,maudie-movie,David Edelstein,70,"Sally Hawkins doesn’t rise above the film’s conception, but she makes it work."
6190,person-to-person-movie,Christy Lemire,38,"Various characters populate Person to Person, but they rarely register as actual people. And while some of their storylines intersect throughout the course of a day in New York, they rarely connect in ways that have actual meaning."
6191,bruce-almighty-movie,Glenn Kenny,25,"The potential for real offense is palpable, but Bruce Almighty never gets there; the script is too lazy and incoherent--truly effective blasphemy takes brains and rigor. "
6192,the-boy-next-door-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,The Boy Next Door plays best as unintentional comedy.
6193,gemma-bovery-movie,Odie Henderson,38,"Sure, the events are scrambled, with minor changes here and there, but if you know what happens in “Madame Bovary,” you will not be surprised by this film. In fact, you’ll probably be as irritated as I was by Gemma Bovery’s attempts to be clever and meta."
6194,fist-fight-movie,Keith Watson,38,"Over-stuffed and under-conceived, Fist Fight is a clumsy mélange of clashing comedic perspectives."
6195,mr-poppers-penguins-movie,Simon Abrams,25,"If you're wondering where the Jim Carrey of ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" fame went, don't look to Mr. Popper's Penguins for answers."
6196,underclassman-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,Utterly generic.
6197,endless-love-movie,Mike Scott,20,"This is supposed to be a movie about obsession. Instead it's just cupcake meets beefcake, with a big glass of milk on the side. And that's one Valentine's Day dinner you can easily pass up."
6198,lovely-still-movie,Alissa Simon,30,"The surprise twist brutally defies the opening narration and plot logic that preceded it, alienating viewers who willingly suspended disbelief."
6199,frank-lola-movie,Stephen Farber,80,"Shannon’s performance is the main attraction of this dark character drama, but it also boasts a seductive atmosphere and some penetrating insights into the male psyche."
6200,the-amityville-horror-movie,Rick Groen,0,"A sustained if wildly uncoordinated assault on our senses, complementing those feverish jump cuts with a cliché of equally stunning proportions"
6201,music-of-the-heart-movie,David Stratton,70,A gloriously sentimental true-life drama
6202,the-smurfs-movie,Keith Uhlich,20,Smurftastic! Now where's that noose?
6203,a-room-for-romeo-brass-movie,Amy Taubin,70,"So low-key it could be mistaken for a throwaway. But Meadows's understanding of childhood fears and fantasies and the yearning, heartfelt performances he draws from his two young actors should not be underestimated."
6204,magic-mike-xxl-movie,Tim Grierson,70,"This sequel to the unlikely 2012 male-stripper sensation has an agreeably ramshackle spirit and another winning turn from star and producer Channing Tatum. As for the dancing, it’s as deliciously spirited as ever."
6205,the-strangers-movie,Michael Sragow,0,"All it offers is sadism, impure and simple."
6206,heathers-movie,Mike Clark,88,It's a tough entry into the tough black-comic genre; don't be surprised if it becomes a classic. [31 March 1989]

6208,captain-america-civil-war-movie,Barry Hertz,88,In nearly every way Civil War represents the dizzying heights of the genre.
6209,my-sisters-keeper-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,70,"If you're going to make a weepy, there's no reason you can't make it with intelligence and insight as the makers of My Sister's Keeper have done."
6210,the-kingdom-movie,J.R. Jones,10,"At its core this is just another piece of big-studio nothingness. The characters are so underwritten they barely qualify as types, and the movie is badly paced, bookended by high-ordnance action sequences but painfully static in the middle."
6211,the-blind-swordsman-zatoichi-movie,David Ansen,70,"A mix-and-match crowd-pleaser that shouldn't add up, but delightfully does. "
6212,fantasia2000-movie,Charles Taylor,30,There's some sort of gross egotism involved in linking great music to visuals that are so unabashedly kitschy.
6213,harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"It's virtually non-stop action, though director David Yates, who has taken good care of these final four, ever-meaner Potter adventures, does a very crafty thing, following adapter Steve Kloves' screenplay."
6214,reservation-road-movie,Maitland McDonagh,63,It's hard to watch two fine actors working themselves into a lather for so little reward.
6215,price-of-glory-movie,Other (Specify),85,"Complaints? None, except perhaps a wish for more length, and a little more depth."
6216,bedtime-stories-movie,Jonathan Curiel,75,A fun bit of escapism that's even tender in spots.
6217,boys-dont-cry-movie,Emanuel Levy,90,"The poignant and candid Boys Don't Cry can be seen as a ""Rebel Without a Cause"" for these culturally diverse and complex times, with the two misfit girls enacting a version of the James Dean/Natalie Wood romance with utmost conviction."
6218,bewitched-movie,Shawn Levy,33,"A terrible, terrible movie. Its creators have a swell idea at the core, a wonderful leading lady, and several stalwart comic players in support, and they make of all of that a picture with the wit of an armpit fart, the verve of a boxwood shrub, and the appeal of a long night in an ER waiting room."
6219,is-that-a-gun-in-your-pocket-movie,Joe Leydon,0,"There are bad movies, and then there are worse movies, and then there are full-bore misfires such as Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?"
6220,norbit-movie,Ken Fox,25,"Mean-spirited and depressing, this horror movie in comedy disguise delights in the twin spectacles of morbid obesity and domestic abuse, of which children are often the target."
6221,i-heart-huckabees-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"It's uncompromisingly bad, single-mindedly off-target."
6222,oceans-8-movie,Christy Lemire,75,"Slickly paced and radiating sexy glamour, “Ocean’s 8” moves with the swagger of a supermodel prancing down the runway."
6223,lucky-numbers-movie,Hazel-Dawn Dumpert,10,"Airless, joyless, worse than you could even imagine."
6224,another-48-hrs-movie,Jay Scott,0,"The first 48 HRS. was similiarly nasty and violent, and it too was emptier than the inside of an efficient bell jar, but it was funny. Eight years later, director Walter Hill can find nothing to laugh about - the violence in this appalling picture is played out in a mirthlessly misanthropic vacuum. [8 Jun 1990, p.C1]"
6225,burnt-movie,Elise Nakhnikian,25,Everything in the by-the-numbers script signals that Adam must transform himself from and abusive tyrant in the kitchen to the head of a loving and fully functional family.
6226,all-eyez-on-me-movie,Nick Allen,12,All Eyez on Me is one of the most useless music biopics ever made — it’ll be too confusing for newcomers and too underwhelming for those familiar with the work and the life of rap prophet Tupac Shakur.
6227,mrs-doubtfire-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,"Williams gives an inspired comic performance. Unfortunately, he outclasses the movie, which is basically a patchwork rip-off of Tootsie."
6228,to-the-wonder-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,80,"To the Wonder is arty for sure, but for the first time, its maker is working with anxieties we all feel. Let’s hope this Malick sticks around for a while."
6229,the-departed-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,"The profanity-laced but witty and literate dialogue by William Monahan (""Kingdom of Heaven"") is delivered by a brilliantly chosen cast, almost all of whom are operating at the very top of their game."

6233,the-interpreter-movie,Jami Bernard,75,"An intelligent, old-fashioned nail-biter."
6234,pilgrimage-movie,Ken Jaworowski,70,"Pilgrimage raises a question or two about unexamined beliefs and religious zeal. Those questions, as well as all that blood, won’t appeal to everyone. But those who can stomach them will receive some dark rewards."
6235,townies-movie,Claudia Puig,75,"Neighbors is the ""Animal House"" for an era in which food fights seem quaint."
6236,dinner-for-schmucks-movie,James Berardinelli,63,The film is sporadically amusing but gives the impression it should be generating more laughs than it does.
6237,collateral-damage-movie,Edward Guthmann,75,Efficient action thriller.
6238,brimstone-movie,Glenn Kenny,25,"Well, if there’s one positive thing to say about Brimstone, it’s that it doesn’t lack for lunatic ambition. "
6239,untraceable-movie,Richard Corliss,0,Untraceable really is disgraceable. It's bad enough when a movie offers up atrocity scenes that would make the Nanking soldiers seem like Hannah Montana; it's repellent when the movie dresses up the sadism in a moral message that condemns the very weakness it is exploiting.
6240,pixels-movie,John Semley,12,"Pixels is a movie without wit, without jokes, with nothing to say but plenty to regurgitate."
6241,it-movie,Marc Savlov,89,Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Skarsgård) is as joltingly nightmarish as fans could have hoped for.
6242,take-me-home-tonight-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,15,"Take Me Home Tonight isn't nearly as much fun as the '80s actually were. Even worse, it's less fun than most '80s comedies were - and that's bad."
6243,sugar-spice-movie,Peter Travers,20,"Give the girls a cheer, but remember: ""Bring It On"" is still the poo, Missy. Take a big whiff."
6244,dear-white-people-movie,Bilge Ebiri,80,"The film is called Dear White People, but it might as well be called Dear Everybody. It’s hilarious, and just about everyone will wince with recognition at some point in the film."
6245,death-to-smoochy-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,"It's so over the top, the top isn't even visible in the rear-view mirror."
6246,southside-with-you-movie,Sam Adams,83,"For all its presidential trappings, the movie is most powerful as a straightforward romance with two endlessly charming black leads, of a kind that, as far as movies go, is outrageously rare."
6247,person-to-person-movie,Inkoo Kang,10,"A day can be mind-numbingly dull or fate-alteringly momentous. Person to Person expresses this duh statement with scarcely more wisdom, nuance, or emotional pull."
6248,ride-along-2-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,0,"The entire film seems cloaked with a general vibe of “good enough.”  Embarrassingly cheap CGI effects, poor ADR, and slipshod, jarring editing are the technical failures that compound with the creative ones to indicate a movie that’s not just miscalculated, but seemingly committed to putting together, at its best, a deliverable product and nothing more."
6249,good-hair-movie,Bob Mondello,70,Good Hair isn't selling anything but a good time.
6250,diamonds-movie,Christopher Brandon,30,A dud.
6251,jauja-movie,Alex Dudok De Wit,80,"A Lynchian coda upends the entire film, raising several questions and resolving none. Fans of rigorous storytelling may find it to be one whimsical step too far, but others will marvel at this miraculous coup de théâtre. Jauja is a film to make you wonder."
6252,birthday-girl-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,10,"It's just that this clunky, inane vehicle sputters barely a few feet down its quaint English highway before you want to bid it ""do zvidániya, dumb-ass!"""
6253,cant-buy-me-love-movie,Roger Ebert,12,Can't Buy Me Love makes American teenagers look like stupid and materialistic twits. That would be all right if the movie were aware of itself and knew what it was doing - if it were a satirical comment on our society. But this movie is as naive as the day is long. It doesn't have a thought in its head and probably no notion of the corruption at its core.
6254,meet-monica-velour-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,70,"This is Ms. Cattrall's movie all the way. Photographed more cruelly than a tabloid victim, she gives Monica a grubby dignity that her ""Sex and the City"" alter ego, Samantha Jones, would wholeheartedly applaud. "
6255,pixels-movie,Kyle Smith,12,It stumbled onto an accomplishment truly awe-inspiring: It makes “Battleship” and “The Watch” look good.
6256,earth-girls-are-easy-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,63,"With cartoon colors, loony tunes and a kitschy-coo sensibility, Earth Girls Are Easy finally lands in theaters after having distributor trouble. This close encounter under the California sun is fun, fun, fun - until its Beach Party-meets-Splash plot unravels. [12 May 1989, p.6D]"

6259,hotel-transylvania-3-summer-vacation-movie,Jamie Righetti,91,"With plenty of laughs, truly dazzling animation, and some more of the franchise’s signature dance sequences, Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is a summer treat worth savoring, and a reminder that if we can see past our differences, we’ll find we’re not that different after all."
6260,teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movie,Cliff Lee,38,"If TMNT the franchise is going to reach the same lofty heights of blockbuster-dom, it still needs to find its own inner hero."
6261,the-glass-house-movie,Robert Koehler,10,"There's nothing in genredom quite so unhinged as the badly made psycho-thriller, and long before it's over, The Glass House collapses from wretched design and execution."
6262,nine-lives-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"A movie like this, with the appearance of new characters and situations, focuses us; we watch more intently, because it is important what happens."
6263,dolores-claiborne-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"It's sometimes distracting to tell a story in flashbacks and memories; the story line gets sidetracked. The director, Taylor Hackford, is successful, however, in making the present seem to flow into and out of the past."
6264,ghost-rider-spirit-of-vengeance-movie,Peter Travers,0,One look at the dreadful mess that is Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance will turn your whisper into a primal Cage scream: MAKE THIS MOVIE STOP!

6266,it-might-get-loud-movie,Mark Jenkins,75,The moments when the guitarists teach the others their best-known riffs are fascinating.
6267,polisse-movie,Sheri Linden,80,"Inspired by a documentary, the film is shot with vérité immediacy and beautifully acted by an outstanding ensemble. If not every piece of the puzzle delivers its intended impact, the movie as a whole gets under your skin, and the central characters resonate long after the screen goes dark."
6268,looper-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,"So what's left for the audience to hook into? Only pounding action, elegant style, steady-state suspense, marvelous acting and, despite that droll pooh-poohing every now and then, haunting explorations of youth, age and personal destiny. It's a lot to claim for a sci-fi thriller, but I was blown away by Rian Johnson's Looper."
6269,love-actually-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,What's the message: that women must remain vigilant about poundage to keep husbands from chasing taut-thighed secretaries? That's a charitable Christmas thought.
6270,the-captive-2014-movie,Robbie Collin,80,"This is Egoyan’s best film for a very long time: like Reynolds, he needed a hit, and The Captive is a welcome return to the form of The Sweet Hereafter. Its eeriness creeps up on you and taps you on the shoulder, and when you spin around, it’s still behind you."
6271,the-ghost-writer-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,Here's another thought: This old man who can't leave the house has just made the first important film of 2010.
6272,how-to-lose-friends-alienate-people-movie,Manohla Dargis,0,The crushingly unfunny and slopped-together How to Lose Friends & Alienate People has neither the ambition nor the intelligence to do justice to its source material.
6273,slackers-movie,Steven Rea,12,"Slackers is, well, consummately cheesy. Ugh."
6274,paranoia-movie,Peter Travers,25,It galls me that Hollywood thinks we're shallow enough to swallow this swill. Or am I just being paranoid?
6275,transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Dazzles the eye, numbs the mind and may cause deafness in some cases. Did I mention to bring along some Excedrin?"
6276,hollow-man-movie,G. Allen Johnson,12,"A terribly bad movie, one of the worst of its kind in recent years."
6277,toys-house-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"Less a movie than a checklist of indiecinema clichés. Youth on a journey of self-discovery? Got it. Dead mom? Uh-huh. Wounded and entitled when it’s trying to be soulful, plotless, laden with indie rock and entirely overhyped at Sundance? Checkarooney."
6278,volver-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"In Volver, the latest marvel to emerge from his sharp and joyful mind, Almodovar blends autobiography, gossip, melodrama, music, the supernatural and the suffocatingly quotidian in a story about a woman -- indeed, a tribe of women -- struggling through a life of pain and disappointment."
6279,tale-of-tales-movie,April Wolfe,90,"Tale of Tales is the most faithful and creatively rendered fairytale onscreen to date, bizarrely satisfying and totally worth a patient, focused viewing."
6280,zoolander-2-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Some movies keep you in a state of suspense. Zoolander 2, a dud glitter-bomb of a sequel, eventually leaves you in a state of suspended animation, with eyes glazed over and brain in sleep mode."
6281,black-knight-movie,Marc Savlov,0,There's precious little to like about the witless and decidedly tedious Black Knight other than the fact that it's unlikely to generate a sequel.
6282,a-simple-plan-movie,Edward Guthmann,75,"[Raimi]'s drawn lovely, complex performances from Paxton and Thornton and proven that he can work effectively -- and movingly -- in a minor emotional key."
6283,national-treasure-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"National Treasure's storyline isn't compelling or coherent enough to warrant the term ""plot."" "
6284,jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-movie,Dave White,30,"The major problem with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom — the fifth installment in this dinosaur series, and the second of a prospective trilogy — is that the makers treat the action and suspense sequences in the way most of us go to the dentist."
6285,enough-movie,Connie Ogle,25,"It's a cannibalization of ""Sleeping With the Enemy,"" a not-so-good Julia Roberts film, with a ridiculous female-empowerment subtext and a relentlessly stupid script that goes nowhere you can't predict before the opening credits roll."
6286,surviving-christmas-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,0,There are no survivors here.
6287,towelhead-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,A blackly funny provocation.
6288,the-longest-ride-movie,Stephanie Merry,37,"People don’t go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course, that requires a story that rings true. In The Longest Ride, authenticity is in short supply."
6289,joe-dirt-movie,Marrit Ingman,0,There's an oddball quality to the ensemble that might even be lovable if the movie weren't so glib and perfunctory.
6290,the-last-five-years-movie,Marc Mohan,25,"The film's structure is a reminder that being Pinteresque isn't the same as being written by Harold Pinter, and its lyrics prove that there's a big difference between something Sondheim-esque and the real deal."
6291,the-amazing-spider-man-2-movie,Dana Stevens,20,"The project as a whole conveys a drab sense of bureaucratic necessity, a ""let's get this over with"" wheeziness."
6292,captain-america-civil-war-movie,Drew McWeeny,100,"What makes Captain America: Civil War such a terrific accomplishment is the way it takes what could have been the most crass and overcrowded story to adapt as a film and instead transforms it into an examination of just who these heroes are and what impact they’ve had on the world around them, and vice versa."
6293,penguins-of-madagascar-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,88,"The screenplay by John Aboud, Michael Colton and Brandon Sawyer has a fizzy, pop-culture pizazz, tempered by a distinctly vaudeville sensibility. It’s smart, but not brainy; dumb, but never inane."
6294,i-spy-movie,Stephen Hunter,20,"Nothing is real, but at the same time, nothing is fake. Nothing is, period. You don't believe a second of it for a second, so banal and predictable is it."
6295,vhs-movie,Owen Williams,80,"Like last year's ""Chronicle,"" here's another reminder that in the right hands found footage still has plenty of capacity to surprise."
6296,the-dead-pool-movie,Jay Scott,25,"In The Dead Pool, Dirty Harry is downright dusty. The erstwhile right-wing San Francisco homicide inspector has mellowed so much in the fifth installment of his adventures that he's become the darling of the liberal Bay Area media and he seems almost bored by blowing people away. [13 Jul 1988, p.C7]"
6297,freedom-writers-movie,Jack Mathews,75,"I say bring 'em on, if the stories can be told as well, as convincingly and as inspirationally as Richard LaGravenese's Freedom Writers, an educational fantasy that happens to be mostly true."
6298,house-of-flying-daggers-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"An outrageously gorgeous spectacle of balletic aggression. At the same time, it offers something we rarely encounter in a whirling martial-arts extravaganza: a romantic passion that's woven into the very fabric of the action."
6299,all-about-steve-movie,Cliff Doerksen,0,"Packaged as a romantic comedy but devoid of comedy or romance, this baffling train wreck stars Sandra Bullock as a tediously kooky constructor of crossword puzzles for a Sacramento newspaper."
6300,tears-of-the-sun-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,75,"Whenever its noble aims miss, Bruce Willis saves it. "
6301,right-now-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,"Le Besco gives an unforgettable performance in a movie that's sweet and sad, formally near-perfect but never cynical."
6302,days-of-heaven-re-release-movie,Ian Nathan,100,Rarely has a film bared itself to simple majesty...it feels epic yet runs barely over and hour and a half. [22 Oct. 1997]
6303,koch-movie,Noel Murray,91,"Neil Barsky's Koch doesn't try to do anything radical as a piece of filmmaking, but Barsky - a former newspaper reporter - covers Koch's story magnificently as a journalist."
6304,abuse-of-weakness-movie,Zachary Wigon,90,"Breillat's impressive film is a study of bodies and how we carry them, and it explores the manner in which weakness seeks out strength on an almost primal level, bypassing the higher modes of human thought."
6305,whiskey-tango-foxtrot-movie,Leah Greenblatt,67,"What work better in the movie are mostly smaller moments: the jokes that land, the rapport between the reporters, and all the weirdly ordinary ways people manage to find a new normal, even in the most WTF circumstances."
6306,filth-and-wisdom-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,An atrocious mess.
6307,funny-games-2008-movie,David Edelstein,0,"Haneke’s assault on our fantasy lives is shallow, unimaginative, and glacially unengaged--a sucker punch without the redeeming passion of punk."
6308,cracks-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"The movie's realistic portrayal of the ingredients that can lead to bullying and other forms of unkindness inflicted on outsiders by those in power, speaks strongly to viewers watching in the 21st century. "
6309,anger-management-movie,David Sterritt,75,"At a time when screen comedy has its own problems with anger management, Sandler's self-possessed style is as refreshing as it is funny."
6310,redoubtable-movie,Peter Keough,38,"Godard Mon Amour is very much like a Woody Allen film, with Godard embodying Allen’s negative traits of pretentiousness, neurosis, and misogyny without the redeeming virtue of humor. "
6311,joe-dirt-movie,Todd McCarthy,10,"Takes a prominent place along with ""Tomcats,"" ""Say It Isn't So,"" ""Saving Silverman"" and ""Get Over It"" on the list of reasons why raucous teen farce is headed six feet under."
6312,inside-out-2015-movie,Alex Abad-Santos,100,"Inside Out is as beautiful as it is abstract, as daring as it is intelligent. It's also the best movie of 2015 so far."
6313,the-matrix-reloaded-movie,David Edelstein,30,"As messy and flat-footed as its predecessor is nimble and shapely. It's an ugly, bloated, repetitive movie that builds to a punch line that should have come an hour earlier (at least). "
6314,we-are-the-best!-movie,Alonso Duralde,100,"You don't have to like punk rock to fall in love with We Are the Best!; if a more joyous film comes along in 2014, then it's a good year indeed."
6315,the-pink-panther-2-movie,Andrea Gronvall,30,"Costars John Cleese, Jean Reno, Alfred Molina, Andy Garcia, and Jeremy Irons look either bored or desperate, gasping for laughs in an airless screenplay."
6316,batman-robin-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"Like a wounded yeti, Batman & Robin drags itself through icicle-heavy sets, dry-ice fog and choking jungle vines, before dying in a frozen heap. Unfortunately, that demise occurs about 20 minutes into the movie, which leaves you in the cold for approximately 106 minutes."
6317,my-big-fat-greek-wedding-movie,Ken Fox,70,"Funny without out ever making fun, Vardalos mixes elements of ethnic stand-up, Cinderella romance and Bridget Loves Bernie-style situation comedy, all grounded in something very real."
6318,mindhunters-movie,Allison Benedikt,12,"Mark my words: Mindhunters will do for psycho-thrillers what ""Showgirls"" did for stripper movies."
6319,flight-of-the-phoenix-movie,Rick Groen,38,The countdown begins with the first negative integer — an amped-up score that overpowers the proceedings like a bad band at a high-school dance.
6320,the-other-woman-2014-movie,Drew McWeeny,33,"This thing swings from broad gross-out comedy to something that seems to be struggling to be a reflection of real life, and it never establishes a baseline reality. It is a strange misfire that is only saved from being a complete disaster by the efforts of the film's two leads."
6321,deepwater-horizon-movie,Peter Debruge,70,"For a movie in which you can’t follow what’s going on for 75% of the time, Deepwater Horizon proves remarkably thrilling."
6322,hell-ride-movie,Aaron Hillis,10,"Bishop's jumbled, wholly unexciting throwback has very little on its mind beyond mythologizing its maker as a bad-ass biker named Pistolero."
6323,the-united-states-of-leland-movie,Dana Stevens,30,"The real question raised by The United States of Leland is not why, but how. How, that is, did so many talented actors find their way to this dreary and derivative study in suburban dysfunction?"
6324,silver-city-movie,Steven Rea,38,"Essentially a series of walking character sketches. The storytelling is slack and lackluster, the cliches rampant."
6325,ride-with-the-devil-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,Ang Lee's dark and sober fable might be the most interesting and least dogmatic view of the Civil War to wend its way into the multiplexes.
6326,reign-of-fire-movie,Dennis Lim,30,"Peaks early with a vertiginous dogfight; thereafter, spotty CGI and a bamboozling plot conspire toward a colossal anticlimax."
6327,vidal-sassoon-the-movie-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,80,"Unpacks the man's story with a dramatic flair that might be mistaken for Zoolanderiffic, if it weren't so aptly accessible."
6328,wadjda-movie,Keith Uhlich,80,"An Arabic-German coproduction, it is a rare movie shot entirely in Saudi Arabia, which has no cinema industry to speak of, and the first feature by a female filmmaker from that country. Forbidden from mixing with the men in her crew, Al-Mansour often directed via walkie-talkie from the back of a van."
6329,this-beautiful-fantastic-movie,Roger Moore,63,"Findlay and Scott don’t force their charm on us, Wilkinson makes the aphorisms, anecdotes and literary quotations poetic and warm. So much of it takes place in the flowers and brambles of a garden that the movie smells like spring."
6330,gun-shy-2017-movie,Joe Leydon,30,"Gun Shy is the sort of leaden misfire in which actors labor mightily to transform themselves into cartoon caricatures in a desperate (and largely unsuccessful) attempt to make viewers think, despite all evidence to the contrary, they are watching a comedy."
6331,colossal-movie,Katie Rife,83,"Monster movies aren’t generally known for their subtlety, but leave it to Nacho Vigalondo to make one that keeps surprising its audience until the very end. "
6332,the-september-issue-movie,Nathan Rabin,67,"A fascinating, frustrating documentary."
6333,saving-private-ryan-movie,Peter Rainer,100,He (Spielberg) commemorates the soldiers in that vast Normandy cemetery in the most absolute and honorable way possible.
6334,two-days-one-night-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"As a parable on karma, capitalism and Darwinian corporate politics, Two Days, One Night can often feel brutal. As a testament to connection, service, sacrifice and self-worth, it’s a soaring, heart-rending hymn."
6335,christmas-with-the-kranks-movie,Ty Burr,12,"Kranks is a feel-good movie in which every character is hateful (except, sigh, the cancer lady), and a Christmas movie too chickenhearted to mention Jesus. "
6336,1941-movie,Gary Arnold,30,"1941 represents an appalling waste of filmmaking and performing resources. As one would expect, Spielberg, who directed ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" sustains a high energy level. But the energy is expended on material that is pointless at best and occasionally hateful. [15 Dec 1979, p.C1]"
6337,a-map-of-the-world-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,An accomplished film that continually takes us beyond our first impressions of people and situations.
6338,notorious-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Notorious makes the death of Biggie Smalls look like a tragic mistake, instead of the outgrowth of a culture devoted to selling the fantasy of who's the biggest man."
6339,5-to-7-movie,Rodrigo Perez,16,"Much more of an adolescent male fantasy than a relatable, genuine film about love or relationships, “5 To 7” is deeply naïve and has very few, if any real insights to the heart or human condition."
6340,the-last-airbender-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"This is one muddled attempt at franchise making: confusing, drab, sluggish. (Ugly, too, if you're forced to see it in 3-D.)"
6341,vanity-fair-movie,Charles Taylor,10,"There may be filmmakers whose own vision is vast enough to take on Thackeray's, but Mira Nair isn't one of them. Her new film of Vanity Fair is a disaster. Scene by scene and moment to moment, it's a woeful misreading of the book."
6342,angel-a-movie,Owen Gleiberman,16,Angel-A shows how director Luc Besson can be French in a way that even the French might despise...Quel ick. And très tedious.
6343,tomcats-movie,Roger Ebert,0,"There is a bright spot. He (Poirier) used up all his doggy-do-do ideas in the first picture ""See Spot Run."""
6344,a-perfect-getaway-movie,Dennis Harvey,70,"A big-reveal thriller with surprises that really do surprise -- and are worth waiting for through an audaciously long buildup -- A Perfect Getaway finds writer-director David Twohy in popcorn form with a muscularity not seen since 2000's ""Pitch Black."""
6345,this-means-war-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"An ugly, misguided exercise. "
6346,where-to-invade-next-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,80,One of [Moore's] more hopeful and celebratory efforts.
6347,why-we-fight-movie,Jean Oppenheimer,70,"Adding to the film's underlying sense of urgency and unease is composer Robert Miller's haunting score, so reminiscent of Philip Glass' music for ""The Fog of War."""
6348,sanctum-movie,Aaron Hillis,30,"Ultimately, the plot-point overload dilutes any palpable sense of dread, excitement or empathy, and it doesn't help that all the dialogue acts in service to either patronizing exposition or turgid interpersonal drama."
6349,coyote-ugly-movie,Robert Wilonsky,0,Cinematic flat-lining.
6350,vhs2-movie,Nick Schager,10,There isn't a scare to be found in the series's second installment.
6351,the-bourne-legacy-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Disappointingly, Bourne never resurfaces in this less-than-satisfying series reboot. The film is more a talky, convoluted, action-starved two-hour subplot. "
6352,hara-kiri-death-of-a-samurai-movie,Scott Tobias,83,"Arriving on the heels of ""13 Assassins,"" Miike's gloriously irreverent take on the samurai action genre, Hara-Kiri seems conventional by his standards, especially in a long middle section that occasionally dips into sentimentality."
6353,friends-with-benefits-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"On the whole, Friends With Benefits is a rewarding summer diversion, albeit one that's fatally torn between what it wants to be -- riotous, anarchic and anti-moralistic -- and the disappointing wet-blanket formula it reverts to in the end. "
6354,formula-51-movie,Dana Stevens,10,"A witless, gruesome barrage of jokey violence and lame trans-Atlantic humor, kept moving by the pointless, derivative kineticism of Mr. Yu's hyperactive cuts and splices."
6355,secondhand-lions-movie,Sheri Linden,70,"Awash in nostalgia, ""Lions"" combines a gentle coming-of-age story with swashbuckling fantasy. While it lacks a necessary tension in its establishing scenes and might be too soft for those who prefer grittier fare."
6356,internal-affairs-movie,Pauline Kael,70,"Bad fun. This sophisticated variant of the LA. cops-and-coke-and-art-world thrillers has a creepy, rhythmic quality that sucks you in and keeps you amused."
6357,nine-lives-2016-movie,Neil Genzlinger,10,"The film, derivative (see “The Shaggy Dog” of 2006) and devoid of wit, is about that tiredest of kid-movie clichés, the parent who is too busy for his children and must be taught a lesson."
6358,year-one-movie,Robert Calvert,12,"We loved this movie the first three times we saw it, when it was called ""Life of Brian,"" ""Wholly Moses,"" and ""History of the World Part 1."""
6359,toy-soldiers-movie,Christopher Harris,38,"If the viewer squirms with embarrassment, it's not over how Petrie has directed his camera or his excellent young cast - it's his heavy-handed material that's beyond redemption, and since he co-wrote that material he has a lot to answer for. [26 Apr 1991]"
6360,whipped-movie,Jami Bernard,0,Profoundly depressing.
6361,say-anything-movie,Pauline Kael,80,"John Cusack and Mahoney have to carry the unconvincing melodramatic portion of the plot, but they carry it stunningly. [15 May 1989]"
6362,a-mighty-wind-movie,David Edelstein,90,"Almost to a one, the people Guest casts are virtuosos, and he lets them hit notes they can't hit anywhere else."
6363,the-firm-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"Very little of what made the written version so enjoyable has been successfully translated to the screen, and what we're left with instead is an overly-long (two hours and thirty-four minutes, to be exact), pedantic thriller."
6364,the-danish-girl-movie,Jeff Baker,67,"The subject is fascinating, the talent is undeniable, but the humanity that made Lili Elbe so memorable gets lost along the way."
6365,mulan-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Mulan is an impressive achievement, with a story and treatment ranking with ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King."""
6366,mousehunt-movie,Mark Caro,63,"The biggest factor working against Mouse Hunt may be its chilliness. Like some of the Coen brothers' work, it's so stylized that it often keeps you at an arm's length instead of sucking you into its whirlwind. "
6367,dungeons-dragons-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"This fantasy crap, fake-o effects and all, betrays princes of dice, masters of graph and wielders of bong."
6368,secondhand-lions-movie,Allison Benedikt,38,"With such a bang-up cast, this setup could at least elicit some tears, but in its 107 minutes, nary a one welled up in my eyes."
6369,hot-tub-time-machine-2-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,30,"Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is a movie that didn't need to be made, and certainly doesn't need to be seen — not when you can rent the original and still feel good about yourself afterward."
6370,a-sound-of-thunder-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,10,Shoddy and ridiculous.
6371,jobs-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,0,"Steered by a lead actor and director, Joshua Michael Stern, who are both way out of their respective leagues, Jobs is excruciating, failing to entertain and all but pissing on its subject's grave."
6372,mile-22-movie,Clint Worthington,25,"A perversely fascinating mess from start to finish, Mile 22 is Berg’s most baffling attempt yet to make art out of the most virulent post-9/11 fears about terrorism and international espionage."
6373,third-person-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,0,"Third Person is an audacious failure, one that even its starry cast can't save. With a trite script, and an even more glib thematic undercurrent, Third Person is nothing short of an outright embarrassment."
6374,the-night-before-movie,Russ Fischer,75,"Always energetic like the wild whoop of a bachelor party, the lights burn brightest when The Night Before indulges in big goofs and kooky tangents."
6375,the-visit-2015-movie,Sheri Linden,30,M. Night Shyamalan’s latest is well cast and strong on setting. But the dull thudding that resounds isn’t part of its effective aural design; it’s the ungainly landing of nearly every shock and joke.
6376,the-night-before-movie,Drew McWeeny,83,"It may be overstuffed the point of bursting, but there's much to like here."
6377,the-wash-movie,David Segal,10,"There's precious little to listen to, laugh at or ogle in The Wash, a sudsy slog that gets sidetracked by, of all things, a plot."
6378,the-bucket-list-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,"I don't know if Rob Reiner is the one to blame for this atrocity, but he directed and coproduced."
6379,like-someone-in-love-movie,Eric Kohn,83,"While not his best work, Like Someone in Love is a nimble expression of Kiarostami's appeal: He remains one of the few directors capable of pulling you into a narrative and making you question its motives at every turn."
6380,certain-women-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Kelly Reichardt makes films that unfold at the speed of life, not Hollywood. She's a poet of the space between words, and the hypnotic and haunting Certain Women presents the writer-director at her artfully attentive best. "
6381,killers-movie,Frank Scheck,20,"An action comedy that nearly renders the term an oxymoron, Killers is devoid of suspense and laughs."
6382,the-skulls-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,This one's a pile of crap that won't start.
6383,equity-movie,Kenji Fujishima,75,The film ultimately succeeds in offering a fresh female-centered perspective on its genre material.
6384,winchester-movie,Peter Travers,12,"It shouldn't happen to anyone, much less a Dame – not a movie of such barreling awfulness as Winchester, which strands the great Helen Mirren in a gothic house of cards that collapses on actors and audiences alike."
6385,heavens-gate-movie,Joseph Jon Lanthier,75,"To his credit, Cimino renders us helpless not before carnage or greed, but before his epic’s breadth of motivation and circumstance. It’s not the past’s ugliness that terrifies us in Heaven’s Gate, but its far more intimidating immensity."
6386,redacted-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"The Americans are portrayed with varying degrees of loathsomeness, but there's not much variety in the film. It's all an awful aberration."
6387,marjorie-prime-movie,Andrew Crump,79,"It’s an exquisitely challenging production, one that calls for repeat viewings over years, all the better to persuade the film to surrender its meaning."
6388,bullet-to-the-head-movie,Peter Travers,25,"I can't detect the hand of Hill in even a single scene in Bullet in the Head. It plays like a Stallone vanity project, impure and stupefyingly simple."
6389,la-vie-en-rose-movie,Steven Rea,100,"For Piaf fans, La Vie en Rose is a must-see. For fans yet-to-be, Dahan and Cotillard's film is an opportunity rich with discovery."
6390,the-amazing-spider-man-2-movie,Liam Lacey,63,Less “amazing” than persistent.
6391,only-god-forgives-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,"Only God Forgives would seem to be a parody of something or other — ""Blue Velvet""? ""Last Year At Marienbad""? — except that the film takes itself seriously to the point of suffocation in telling its lurid tale of slaughter and revenge."
6392,cutie-and-the-boxer-movie,Eric Kohn,100,"Heinzerling's beautifully shot, painfully intimate look at the aging couple's struggle to survive amid personal and financial strain is both heartbreaking and intricately profound. This is a story about creative desire so strong it hurts."
6393,look-at-me-movie,Dana Stevens,80,"A witty and acute examination of friendship, ambition and betrayal in the Parisian literary world."
6394,monsieur-lazhar-movie,Joe Williams,88,"Until a devastatingly effective finale, Monsieur Lazhar is an exercise in delicacy, carried by Fallag's gentle performance and a fine cast of kid actors."
6395,pin-cushion-movie,Katie Walsh,70,"Scanlan is stunning as the odd but fiercely loving Lyn. She regards Iona warily, knowingly, seeing into her future and what she’s walking into, but with no way to stop it."
6396,taken-3-movie,Elise Nakhnikian,12,Empowerment porn for those who long for the Cold War's clarity of purpose and American dominance in this murky age of terror.
6397,pineapple-express-movie,Shawn Levy,75,So filled with verve and wit for much of its running time that it's depressing to watch it devolve into genuine foolishness and borderline incoherence in its final act.
6398,good-luck-chuck-movie,Chris Nashawaty,0,Can we finally just admit that Dane Cook isn't funny? In a comedy so lame its plot could've been swiped from a Bazooka Joe wrapper.
6399,butterfly-kiss-movie,J. Hoberman,10,"This smoothly odious piece of work, written by Frank Cottrell Boyce and directed by Michael Winterbottom, posits the self-consciously repellent Plummer as a sort of Valerie Solanas-inflected version of the Florida serial killer Aileen Wournos. [7 May 1996]"
6400,evan-almighty-movie,Michael Sragow,16,A colossal dud.
6401,in-the-valley-of-elah-movie,Tamara Straus,100,"For the most part it is an effective, disturbing and - a rarity for Haggis - subtle exploration of the stateside war story."
6402,eat-pray-love-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"Still, Eat Pray Love preaches a sermon it doesn't practice-the need to open one's self to the world. In a pictorial sense this is exactly what Liz does; she vacuums up the transformative essence of three continents. Yet the world gets weirdly short shrift because this transcendently narcissistic movie is, in a narrative sense, almost entirely about Liz and the movie star who plays her."
6403,blue-is-the-warmest-color-movie,Michael Phillips,88,Even with its limitations it's one of the necessary films of 2013. 
6404,swept-away-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"The film turns out to have nothing going for it at all, except a small charge for soul-deep Madonna haters."
6405,the-wolfman-movie,Andy Klein,33,"The Wolfman isn’t scary. In fact, it isn’t much of anything."
6406,moonrise-kingdom-movie,Richard Corliss,80,"Cheers for a Cannes director who has infused his technical mastery with radiant life. In the Museum of the World of Wes Anderson, the dolls are dancing."
6407,the-american-president-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,Genial middle-brow fare that coasts a long way on the charm of its two stars
6408,american-wedding-movie,Lawrence Toppman,63,"This isn't really a narrative: It's a collection of mostly unrelated scenes, about half of which pay off."
6409,lucky-you-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"This spring, boredom has a new name: Lucky You.  In the poker flick, an announcer calling a climactic poker match uses a Texas hold 'em term frequently, saying, ""And the flop. And the flop. And the flop."" This movie reviews itself."
6410,devils-due-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,25,It’s more silly than scary.
6411,killer-joe-movie,Betsy Sharkey,80,"By far the film's deadliest weapon is McConaughey. The way the actor leans into threats, dropping his voice, wrapping eloquence in sinister tones, is skin-crawling. The muscles in his neck literally seem to tense one by one. And if the eyes are the window to the soul, you really don't want to peer for long into his. It is not an easy performance to watch, but it is unforgettable."
6412,contagion-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,"This may not fit any conventional definition of entertainment, but it certainly keeps your eyes on the screen."
6413,to-save-a-life-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,A well-meaning but ineptly made message movie.
6414,red-army-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"Red Army is about many things — politics and sport, service and servitude, integrity trumped by money. Most memorably, though, it celebrates a good man living a great life by his own lights. "
6415,bridget-joness-diary-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Made against all odds into a funny and charming movie that understands the charm of the original, and preserves it."
6416,whipped-movie,Kevin Thomas,10,"Way too bleak to be funny, even as a contemporary satire of the battle of the sexes."
6417,fifty-shades-of-grey-movie,Rodrigo Perez,0,"Ultimately, Fifty Shades Of Grey is embarrassing and depressing, especially when considering the picture as a reflection of the quality of mainstream modern romance today. "
6418,son-of-saul-movie,Michael Phillips,100,"This is a small, tight, starkly claustrophobic film, closer in impact to Elie Wiesel's first-person account of the concentration camps, ""Night,"" than to the artful, slightly suspect emotional catharsis of director Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List."""
6419,nurse-betty-movie,Richard Schickel,90,"All in all, Nurse Betty is a wonderful movie, unpredictably alive to the fact that the American citizenry is a lot stranger than we like to admit."
6420,blade-runner-2049-movie,Dom Sinacola,84,Blade Runner 2049 should resonate deeply with anyone who’s ever held love for the original.
6421,the-invention-of-lying-movie,Nick Pinkerton,30,"Lying brushes more big ideas than commonplace comedies, but hasn't taken those ideas through enough drafts to work out their implications or--harder still--make them killingly funny."
6422,clue-movie,Michael Blowen,12,"Clue the movie, not the board game, isn't so much a drama as it is a marketing gimmick. Presumably, Paramount Pictures believed that an audience was clamoring to see actors play one-dimensional figures from a game. [13 Dec 1985, p.57]"
6423,detroit-rock-city-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"A turgid, unfunny, out-of-time rockspolitation movie."
6424,girls-will-be-girls-movie,Alexis Soloski,10,"The situations begin tamely, but escalate to drunken vomiting and drugged rapes—all played for yuks. Or is it yucks?"
6425,gran-torino-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,"It's also a terrific, career-capping role for Eastwood, who claims he's now retired as an actor. He shows off his comic chops more fully than in any film since ""Bronco Billy"" more than a quarter-century ago."
6426,8-women-movie,J. Hoberman,10,"For all the tumultuous entrances and flouncing exits, the eight principals manage maybe three laughs among them."
6427,the-incredibles-2-movie,David Sims,85,"While it takes time to build up steam and set up its plot mechanics, once everyone is in costume and letting loose, it’s an exhilarating ride."
6428,red-planet-movie,Bob Graham,0,There still is no life on Mars. Red Planet is airless.
6429,made-of-honor-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,"A nice cookie-cutter comedy, no more and no less, but Dempsey, with his relaxed charm, and Monaghan, with her soft and peachy sensual spark, rise to the challenge of making friendship look like the wellspring of true love."
6430,changeling-movie,Keith Phipps,75,"Eastwood creates a tone that's at once stately and unsettling, allowing a lot of breathing room for Jolie's sad, unyielding performance. She anchors a film that needs an anchor the further it goes along."
6431,clash-of-the-titans-movie,Ty Burr,38,The results are -- there’s no other word for it -- a disaster.
6432,wild-wild-west-movie,Amy Taubin,10,"So extremely stupid and incompetent, I doubt that even the most impartial critic could find much to praise."
6433,the-child-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"Like all the Dardenne s' films, L'Enfant embraces a peculiarly ascetic brand of what, in other filmmakers' hands, might seem like cheap melodrama."
6434,precious-based-on-the-novel-push-by-sapphire-movie,Noel Murray,75,"Not even Douglas Sirk or Lars von Trier would heap so much abuse on a heroine. And yet, on its own melodramatic, tear-jerking terms, Precious works."
6435,hell-ride-movie,Mark Olsen,30,"The film gets the scummy patina right, all phony-Leone dusty trails, but while everybody on screen looks to be enjoying themselves, it is no fun to watch."
6436,its-complicated-movie,Michael Phillips,75,It's Complicated isn’t: It’s pretty simple. It’s simply a good time.
6437,fair-game-movie,James Berardinelli,12,"Fair Game is howlingly bad - so awful, in fact, that it can actually be enjoyed on a certain level."
6438,do-the-right-thing-movie,Vincent Canby,100,A remarkable piece of work. [30 June 1989]
6439,dantes-peak-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Approximately the last hour of Dante's Peak is made up of action scenes, and how well one likes computer-generated destruction will determine how well one likes the movie."
6440,let-the-right-one-in-movie,Sean Axmaker,83,"It's a little long and dissipates some of its power in an unfocused subplot, but the skewed sensibility of the film is both innocent and feral and offers a smart and satisfying reworking to the familiar genre. An American remake is already in the works."
6441,bushwick-movie,A.O. Scott,30,"The filmmakers feign boldness in tackling national politics, but revert to coyness and caricature when it comes to local matters, gesturing toward a multiculturalism that isn’t even skin deep and sweeping gentrification under the rug."
6442,the-terminal-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,Hanks is great; the movie isn't. 
6443,the-wolfpack-movie,Scott Foundas,70,"So weirdly fascinating is the tale of the Angulo clan that one wishes The Wolfpack were that much sharper, more searching and coherently organized. Still, there is much to enjoy in director Crystal Moselle’s debut documentary feature."
6444,simply-irresistible-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,"Somehow both formulaic and bat-shit insane. It's sort of a given that films in this genre won't be rigorous cerebral exercises, but Simply Irresistible is almost hypnotic in its unyielding stupidity."
6445,the-master-movie,Joe Neumaier,80,"This superb, cerebral film about unchecked belief is a fictionalized and cutting drama hinging on the origins of Scientology. Scratch around a bit, though, and its wider indictments become clear."
6446,dunkirk-movie,Christopher Machell,100,"The director's technical mastery finally transcends craft to become art and, as a result, this is his best film to date."
6447,starsky-hutch-movie,Ty Burr,63,"Stealing the movie, however, is rapper Snoop Dogg as Huggy Bear, the pimp/informant originally portrayed by Antonio Fargas on the TV show. "
6448,walking-tall-movie,Addison MacDonald,25,"Short on story, character, and attempts to win viewers' emotional investment, the film only seems to take a breath when The Rock is making the baddies lose theirs."
6449,muppets-most-wanted-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"The story matters only in that it creates opportunities for heaps of ridiculousness, and writer-director James Bobin (who also directed The Muppets), along with co-writer Nicholas Stoller, mines them skillfully and breezily."
6450,the-fault-in-our-stars-movie,Richard Corliss,80,Hazel and Augustus will live in film lore because of the young actors who play them. 
6451,abundant-acreage-available-movie,Rodrigo Perez,75,"A humanist narrative about family, faith, and grief, ‘Acreage’ is an intimate film with few outsized dramatic moments, but as anchored by Amy Ryan’s mannered yet commanding performance—her finest in years—this lovely little story sensitively absorbs."
6452,beverly-hills-cop-iii-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,"Beverly Hills Cop III is made with so little spark, humor, and internal logic that it makes me better appreciate these other recent Murphy movies where the actor/comedian at least stretched his persona and attempted something apart from the action comedy mold."
6453,good-time-movie,E. Oliver Whitney,90,"Good Time is a uniquely exhilarating experience with a sharp, unflinching style and a magnetic performance from Robert Pattinson."
6454,role-models-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,The fun of Role Models is that it's a high-concept movie executed with speed and finesse and the kind of brusquely tossed-off obscene banter that can get you laughing before you know what hit you.
6455,the-devil-inside-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"The Devil Inside offers proof, if any were needed, that demons run rampant in Hollywood, possessing otherwise intelligent and creative people to make absolutely shitty ""gotcha!"" mockumonstrosities like this one. "
6456,bowfinger-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,Disciplined script -- bitingly funny.
6457,scooby-doo-2-monsters-unleashed-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,"With almost nothing else going for it, the sequel will likely be a disappointment to everyone except 10-year-old barf joke aficionados and a few stoned adults."
6458,20th-century-women-movie,Gregory Ellwood,91,"Masterfully played by Annette Bening, Dorothea is a fascinating character of contradictions."
6459,a-good-year-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"Russell Crowe may find himself discovering the simple joys of life in A Good Year, but audiences will be checking their watches during this joyless attempt at comedy."
6460,free-birds-movie,Drew Taylor,16,The characters are so two-dimensional that a meaningful connection with the material isn't elusive; it's downright impossible.
6461,thirteen-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,"With an authenticity that is tender and merciless, the movie shows you what it looks like when youth rebellion becomes a form of fascism."
6462,locke-movie,Alonso Duralde,100,"Hardy might be past needing a star-making performance, but this is the kind of work that raises him to highest echelon of actors working in film today. He and Knight remind us that artists can astonish with the simplest of methods."
6463,marci-x-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"The makers of “Bringing Down The House” should thank the gods of cinema for Marci X, which has relieved the Steve Martin/Queen Latifah hit of its status as the year's most misguided culture-clash comedy."
6464,gigli-movie,Jeff Giles,10,"After the schadenfreudian thrill of watching beautiful people humiliate themselves wears off, it has the same annihilating effect on your will to live."
6465,midnight-in-paris-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"The best Allen movie in 10 years, or maybe even close to 20 - is all about that idea: Reckoning with the past as a real place, but also worrying about the limits of nostalgia."
6466,toy-story-3-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"Toy Story 3 is a better film than ""Wall-E"" and ""Up"" in that it succeeds completely in conventional terms. For 103 minutes, it never takes audience interest for granted. It has action, horror and vivid characters, and it always keeps moving forward."
6467,head-in-the-clouds-movie,Ty Burr,38,"If you're up for a relentlessly overripe melodrama that takes place in movie-Europe as opposed to the real thing (the Parisian streetwalkers in berets are a good tip-off), by all means catch Head in the Clouds."
6468,evan-almighty-movie,Michael Ferraro,20,"An unnecessary sequel to the equally unnecessary ""Bruce Almighty."""
6469,17-again-movie,Perry Seibert,25,"Never figures out what it wants to be, and ends up a jumbled mess that nobody wants."
6470,guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,"It's easy to get carried away with movies like this, which lend themselves to fanboy hype. It's not a perfect movie. But it is one that is hugely enjoyable, bears repeated viewings and will be as funny in 10 years (or 50) as it is now. And that's pretty swell."
6471,the-maid-movie,Dana Stevens,100,"It's funny--bleakly, blackly so at times, but also tenderly funny with flashes of genuine compassion. The Maid is among the best films I've seen this year."
6472,goat-movie,G. Allen Johnson,0,"Perhaps it helps to think of Goat as a horror movie. There is a genre of horror film known as torture porn — films that revel in graphic depictions of torture, violence and sadism, mostly to defenseless victims. Think of Goat as hazing porn."
6473,grizzly-man-movie,Michael Atkinson,90,"For many the question remains about how Treadwell's eventual death should be regarded--as a tragedy, as a fool's fate, or as comeuppance for daring to humanize wild predators and habituating them to human presence. Herzog's perspective is, of course, scrupulously nonjudgmental."
6474,madagascar-escape-2-africa-movie,Tasha Robinson,25,"When it comes to time-wasting memory games, crossword puzzles are more fun than this movie."
6475,venus-movie,Desson Thomson,80,"Director Roger Michell and writer Hanif Kureishi take a deeper, edifying interest in the moral ambiguities that arise between Maurice and Jessie. And thanks to our warm investment in both characters, we're more than willing to sign up for this existential ride. We allow this relationship -- and the movie -- to take us places we'd never usually go."
6476,interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles-movie,Marc Savlov,67,"It is, however, a very satisfying film, and surely the first in a long franchise (it does, after all, bear the subtitle The Vampire Chronicles)."
6477,donnie-darko-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"Most experienced filmmakers wouldn't even attempt a film that's so blackly funny, that so rapidly shifts genres and tone, and that layers late '80s cultural references so thickly, from ""E.T."" to Smurfs."
6478,the-real-blonde-movie,Barbara Shulgasser,75,"A smart, funny and endearing movie. It has enough cynicism to satisfy the part of DiCillo that would mock a blue-eyed superstar, yet enough genuine sentiment to make it possible for us to swallow the cynicism. "
6479,in-praise-of-love-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"I see so little there: It is all remembered rote work, used to conceal old tricks, facile name-calling, the loss of hope, and emptiness."
6480,hot-rod-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"Hot Rod started to go wrong at about the time someone in casting said, ""You know what? I'll bet America's just about ready for the comedy stylings of Sissy Spacek."""
6481,the-million-dollar-hotel-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,Wenders's The Million Dollar Hotel is something of a monstrosity -- liquored self-indulgence taken to its own astral plane.
6482,potiche-movie,Eric Kohn,91,"Potiche successfully satirizes the gender politics at its core. At the same time, it knowingly mocks the obsession over debates about the suppression of women that pervaded the culture during the movie's setting."
6483,bucky-larson-born-to-be-a-star-movie,Andrew Barker,10,One of the most astonishingly unfunny films of this or any other year. 
6484,air-force-one-movie,Lisa Alspector,20,"Wolfgang Petersen and writer Andrew Marlowe, apparently afraid to really make fun of any American icons, challenge us to take the story straight no matter what, but the only thing this ponderous movie has going for it is its unintentional humor."
6485,we-the-party-movie,Stephanie Merry,38,"With the raunch of ""American Pie"" and the heart of an after-school special, the comedy turns out to be a lot less than the sum of its parts."
6486,boyhood-movie,Lawrence Toppman,100,"There’s not a great theme, a great performance or even a great scene in Boyhood. But I think it might be a great picture."
6487,big-mommas-house-movie,Ron Stringer,20,"Yo momma so fat, when she gets in an elevator, it has to go down. Had enough?"
6488,house-of-d-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,38,"All the characters are writ in broad strokes, making it impossible to sympathize with, much less relate to, anyone."
6489,just-go-with-it-movie,Kyle Smith,12,You know you're in trouble when you're suffering a comedy shutout and the pinch-hitters you send in are Kidman and Dave Matthews.
6490,boomerang-movie,Kenneth Turan,10,"A film that is more listless than funny and could surely use some of the energy that animated both Art Buchwald and Paramount Pictures in the lawsuit surrounding authorship of [Eddie Murphy]'s 1988 ""Coming to America."" [01 Jul 1992]"
6491,detroit-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"Detroit is a movie that will make you angry. It is designed to make you angry, and it does nothing to soften the blow or create some artificial uplift. But there is something about honesty that’s exhilarating. Detroit is tough, but it’s worth it, every minute of it."
6492,butterfly-kiss-movie,Derek Elley,90,"From its opening shots, Butterfly Kiss exudes a confidence and distinctive feel that promises something rather special. Unlike its characters, the pic knows where it's going."
6493,life-partners-movie,Gabe Toro,25,It's the sort of film where music montages are used like wallpaper to take narrative shortcuts and minimize messy conflict.
6494,the-alamo-movie,Richard Corliss,70,"Politics aside, this is a handsome film with orange skies to die for, or under, and a lovely score by Carter Burwell. The picture has some ponderous and snooze-worthy stretches, but it attains a certain melancholic grandeur, with the actors and crew fighting as desperately as Crockett and Bowie to make the best of a fated adventure."
6495,saraband-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"If it's not an actual masterpiece, it's at least the next best thing, a fully characteristic, fully alive work by a master of his art."
6496,enders-game-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"Straightforward, a bit literal-minded, very faithful to the book and largely compelling. "
6497,get-a-job-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,"Only Bryan Cranston, as Teller’s downsized dad, emerges with his dignity fully intact from Get a Job, whose scattershot direction is credited to Dylan Kidd (“Roger Dodger”)."
6498,a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"It’s a spooky, moody doozy of a debut, lensed by Director of Photography Lyle Vincent in a radiant monochrome that somehow makes even the darkness sparkle."
6499,hitchcock-movie,Andrew Schenker,12,"If you've ever seen Psycho, or even if you know anything at all about the film, Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock would like to congratulate you on your savvy."
6500,amistad-movie,Emanuel Levy,70,Aiming to instruct as well as entertain --- and often struggling to reconcile these two divergent goals.
6501,say-it-isnt-so-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,A black comedy in the form of vicarious serial punishment.
6502,no-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Even if No is not the whole truth — and no film is — its pungent dialogue and involving characters tell a delicious and very pertinent tale. And the messages it delivers, its thoughts on the workings of democracy and the intricacies of personality, are just as valuable and entertaining — maybe even more so."
6503,the-aristocrats-movie,James Greenberg,90,"Obscene, disgusting, vulgar and vile, The Aristocrats might be the funniest movie you'll ever see."
6504,the-illusionist-movie,Bill Gallo,90,"Beautifully acted and handsomely mounted, this gorgeous period piece is an intelligent and intriguing exploration of ""the dark arts"" -- less dependent on mere hocus-pocus than on the convincing journey of the soul undertaken by its hero."
6505,buzzard-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,80,Buzzard is both deeply unfun and something you can’t take your eyes off. It gets our edge of recommendation because there’s real focus to it: Marty’s ambitions are so low (his life seems to climax while wolfing down a $20 plate of spaghetti in a hotel room) that you truly fear for the future. Meet the new slacker.
6506,the-horse-whisperer-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,80,A handsome and effective-if over-long-tear-jerker about thwarted love between grown-ups who should know better.
6507,platoon-movie,Richard Corliss,90,"With craft, crackle, a little bombast and plenty of residual rage, he has created a time-capsule movie that explodes like a frag bomb in the consciousness of America, showing how it was back then, over there."
6508,milk-movie,A.O. Scott,100,"Harvey Milk was an intriguing, inspiring figure. Milk is a marvel."
6509,son-of-the-mask-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,"Lacks ""spark."""
6510,the-incredibles-2-movie,Robert Abele,95,"The good news is that this continuation is a similarly rousing and savvy adventure that energetically serves up more of what we love — from the sleek retro-futurist designs to the ticklishly severe Eurasian super-clothier Edna Mode — and yet wisely, wittily, reverses the first film’s accommodating traditionalism to make for an even richer, funnier portrait of its tight and in-tights family."
6511,furry-vengeance-movie,Ty Burr,12,"Vengeance has the odor of court-ordered community service. The jokes never rise above the groin. The trees look plastic, the characters more so."
6512,seven-pounds-movie,Scott Foundas,0,Dispiritingly obvious and phony from top to bottom.
6513,the-post-movie,Gary Thompson,88,"Spielberg and Co. are obviously excited to be making The Post, and that palpable enthusiasm makes the movie feel so unusually lively for a big-studio movie. It’s nimble, crisp, passionate, full of verve and invention."
6514,the-divergent-series-allegiantpart-1-movie,Kimberley Jones,30,"Three films into the ongoing Divergent series, one would hope we’d moved beyond laying plates and folding napkins to get to something more substantial. Yet Allegiant barely makes it to the appetizer course."
6515,the-secret-of-the-grain-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Rather than observing this family, we feel we are part of it, and that draws us in as nothing else can."
6516,highlander-endgame-movie,Cody Clark,14,Thinking (logically or otherwise) about this movie is a waste of your brain cells.
6517,stories-we-tell-movie,David Edelstein,90,"So Polley has gone meta — exuberantly, entertainingly, with all her heart."
6518,a-dogs-purpose-movie,Rex Reed,88,"It is without question the best dog movie since ""Lassie Come Home."" "
6519,starting-out-in-the-evening-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,Andrew Wagner has made a lovely comedy of death and rebirth.
6520,life-as-a-house-movie,Michael Sragow,25,Life as a House mounts a brutally insensitive attack on its audience's sensitivities.
6521,snow-dogs-movie,Dana Stevens,10,"Snow Dogs is, even by the standards of a tradition that includes ""Son of Flubber"" and ""The Shaggy D.A.,"" remarkably inept."
6522,the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-movie,Roger Ebert,0,"A contemptible film: Vile, ugly and brutal. There is not a shred of a reason to see it. "
6523,jackie-movie,Barry Hertz,100,"To watch Portman’s every move is to not only watch history being recreated, but to also witness history being made. No one will ever be able to touch this role again. Or, at least, no one should."
6524,diamond-men-movie,Jay Carr,88,"Riding a mood that's tilted to the jazzy blues that Eddie prefers to Bobby's blasting rock on the car radio, Diamond Men is a sparkly film that's easy to love."
6525,my-babys-daddy-movie,Chuck Wilson,30,"Strictly Urban Comedy 101, as if the filmmakers had neither the inclination nor the chops to move the genre past timeworn stereotypes."
6526,suicide-squad-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"There isn’t a moment of spontaneous fun or humor in this long, turgid movie, the latest let-down for rabid DC Comics fans who’ve been waiting for someone to pick up the baton Christopher Nolan left behind and do this universe justice. With “Suicide Squad,” the long wait continues."
6527,find-me-guilty-movie,M. E. Russell,75,"Lumet blatantly, simplistically stacks the decks in favor of the defendants, pitting them against mean, stupid cops and a cartoonishly nasty prosecutor."
6528,12-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"12 is every bit as much of a moral powerhouse as its predecessors but with the added bonus of being simultaneously intellectually riveting and, at times, almost indescribably poetic."
6529,august-rush-movie,Ken Fox,38,"Odd, quasi-mystical movie that’s too silly for adults to take seriously and frankly too weird for kids."
6530,dead-again-movie,James Berardinelli,100,"Dead Again does not come across as a Hitchcock knock-off, but as a motion picture that incorporates familiar themes and approaches while maintaining its own integrity and identity. Not once during the entire production is there an obviously stolen scene or camera angle replication."
6531,american-wedding-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,A gross-out saga that sentient adults should avoid like the plague.
6532,jurassic-park-iii-movie,Michael Atkinson,20,Drama is minimal and character nonexistent.
6533,holy-man-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,"All the advance signs looked discouraging, but I still kept thinking: How bad could a comedy starring Eddie Murphy and Jeff Goldblum really be? Well, let's put it this way … you won't ever hear me asking that particular question again."
6534,dont-say-a-word-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"This noirish, sourish thriller left me unmoving as well as unmoved."
6535,avp-alien-vs-predator-movie,Cliff Doerksen,30,Dumb.
6536,whipped-movie,Chuck Wilson,0,"As repellent as their characters are, one feels a degree of pity for the three male leads, who give fresh evidence that hungry actors can't say no to a studio feature, no matter how humiliating the script."
6537,the-outsider-2018-movie,Blake Goble,33,"It’s clichéd, distant, afraid to truly immerse itself in anything but long looks, but at least it looks good. And that’s that."
6538,the-ides-of-march-movie,Roger Moore,88,"It isn't a great film. But it is a smart and high-minded one, wonderfully cast, with understated direction. Clooney is good enough in the lead to stir talk of a political future. "
6539,the-in-crowd-movie,Kimberely Jones,0,The In Crowd is nothing but a deadly dull business.
6540,spy-kids-all-the-time-in-the-world-movie,Mike Hale,30,"The fall-off in sexiness, soulfulness and wittiness from Ms. Gugino and Antonio Banderas, the parents in the first three ""Spy Kids"" films, to Ms. Alba and Joel McHale is whiplash steep. "
6541,xxx-state-of-the-union-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,The special effects excite at first but wear out their welcome.
6542,urban-legends-final-cut-movie,Nick Rutigliano,20,"Simply less campily moronic than its predecessor, a tired kill-by-numbers."
6543,the-heart-is-deceitful-above-all-things-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"The movie is terrible, but made with verve and sincerity, all of it pointed in the wrong direction."
6544,alice-through-the-looking-glass-movie,Stephanie Merry,25,"Wondrous visuals only go so far, in a film that turns out to be lethally dull. "
6545,pitch-perfect-3-movie,Justin Chang,20,"The trailer for Pitch Perfect 3 makes it look and sound like a comedy, which puts me in the unfortunate position of announcing that it is nothing of the kind. It's a tragedy in four-part harmony."
6546,the-painted-veil-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"A lot takes place during The Painted Veil's two-hour running length, but most of what happens occurs within the hearts and minds of the leads."
6547,deadpool-movie,Chris Nashawaty,75,"It doesn’t have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story. What it has is the balls to mess with the formula and have some naughty, hard-R fun. It’s a superhero film for the wiseasses shooting spitballs in the back of the school bus."
6548,the-wettest-county-in-the-world-movie,Joe Williams,63,"Despite some gruesome images and the psychotic fervor of Rakes, it's a frustratingly slow boil. "
6549,ponyo-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,"You watch a Miyazaki film with the pie-eyed, gape-mouthed awe of a child being read the most fantastic story and suddenly transported to places previously beyond the limits of imagination. It's quite a trip."
6550,original-sin-movie,A.O. Scott,20,"Everything in this film is forgettable, right down to bongos pounding on the soundtrack to indicate a quickening of the pulse."
6551,they-remain-movie,Bilge Ebiri,30,"They Remain wants to unsettle us and invade our brains. Instead, what little power it has vanishes long before the credits roll. What remains is tedium."
6552,bobby-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,One of the year's worst movies.
6553,grown-ups-movie,Stephen Holden,0,"It doesn't get worse than Grown Ups, Adam Sandler's sloppy entry into this year's man-child-comedy sweepstakes. Lazy, mean-spirited, incoherent, infantile and, above all, witless."
6554,zookeeper-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,I'm not gonna sugarcoat this: Movies don't have to be this bad.
6555,daddy-day-care-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"I laughed a couple of times, but mostly I was bored out of my mind and not a little depressed. "
6556,the-cat-in-the-hat-movie,Ty Burr,12,"If the producers had dug up Ted Geisel's body and hung it from a tree, they couldn't have desecrated the man more."
6557,the-big-sick-movie,Sara Stewart,75,"Mainly, though, this is Nanjiani’s show. Bits of his smart, cross-culturally incisive stand-up are sprinkled throughout, in performances alongside his fellow comics (one of whom is Aidy Bryant of “SNL”)."
6558,the-crocodile-hunter-collision-course-movie,Eric Campos,10,"Crikey, what a croc o’ shit! But hey, at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading. So as painful as this movie is to watch, if you willingly buy a ticket, you’re only doing it to yourself."
6559,silent-hill-movie,Ray Bennett,20,"Witless, soulless and joyless, it displays its video game origins throughout."
6560,mrs-doubtfire-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"Strictly speaking, it's not a top example of movie making, but it offers two hours of undeniably solid entertainment, and not too many viewers can argue with that."
6561,brooklyn-movie,Stephen Whitty ,80,Gradually the film turns its very specific story of one immigrant into a moving group portrait.
6562,rumble-in-the-bronx-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"Rumble in the Bronx never quite achieves the smack-you-around zest of Chan's Hong Kong pictures. Still, it's hard to dislike a movie with such a friendly sense of the preposterous."
6563,a-walk-on-the-moon-movie,Elvis Mitchell,90,"Even when it turns turbulent, the film sustains its warm summer glow, and makes itself a conversation piece about the moral issues it means to raise."
6564,the-incredibles-2-movie,Josh Kupecki,78,"The action sequences are breathtaking, and the character-driven humor is, as per usual, top notch. "
6565,passion-play-movie,Keith Phipps,16,"Passion Play doesn't overreach so much as it overindulges in aimless pacing, inert acting, and a romance maudlin enough to make ""Twilight"" look restrained. "
6566,88minutes-movie,Ella Taylor,0,"We may have to sit through worse films to come this year, but with any luck, there'll be none as guilelessly, idiotically misogynist as this one."
6567,remember-the-titans-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"So smug and so proud of itself, and you can tell that everybody involved conceives of it as a civics lesson instead of a story, that they squeeze all the life out of it."
6568,jack-the-giant-slayer-movie,Roger Moore,63,"For all Singer’s expertise at making the fantastic real, all we’re left with here is an expensive-looking bauble – worth looking over, but not really anything to treasure."
6569,fighting-movie,Peter Hartlaub,75,"In a genre where too many films are all brawn and no brain, Fighting is a contender."
6570,the-mill-and-the-cross-movie,Nick Pinkerton,90,"An extraordinary example of both art-historical interpretation and CGI as passport to unknown lands, The Mill and the Cross, based on a book by Michael Francis Gibson, is a moving-image tribute to the still image, with its ability to ""wrestle the senseless moment to the ground."""
6571,godzilla-1998-movie,Lisa Alspector,10,"Overlong, neither funny nor scary movie about a big lizard."
6572,the-purge-movie,James Berardinelli,25,This is quite possibly the most moronic motion picture I have seen thus far in 2013 and that's saying a lot.
6573,charlie-countryman-movie,Rex Reed,0,"The result is the most idiotic excess of sex and bloodshed since ""Only God Forgives."""
6574,goats-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,Goats is just b-a-a-a-aad.
6575,kill-the-messenger-movie,Roger Moore,75,Renner’s performance — beginning with bluster and descending into twitchy paranoia — sells it and makes us fret for every “messenger” suddenly the target of the spotlight himself.
6576,bad-boys-ii-movie,Peter Travers,0,"Bad Boys II has everything. Everything loud, dumb, violent, sexist, racist, misogynistic and homophobic that producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay can think of puking up onscreen."

6579,bright-leaves-movie,Peter Rainer,90,"While making his new film, he (McElwee) imagines that his boy is looking back at his screen image from some distant point in the future, when McElwee himself is gone. No child of a moviemaker could ask for a more beautiful bequest."
6580,ben-hur-movie,Kate Taylor,25,"As the new Ben-Hur unspools into insignificance and sentimentality, there are fleeting moments that suggest someone behind this $100-million movie was actually thinking hard about how to replay a schlocky biblical epic for a secular audience in 2016."
6581,the-gift-movie,Rene Rodriguez,63,"She (Blanchett) single-handedly forms the human heart of this engrossing, if ultimately preposterous, supernatural thriller."
6582,american-pie-movie,Ann Hornaday,38,An uninteresting take on a tired formula that is only occasionally funny and usually pretty gross.
6583,stratton-movie,Anna Smith,20,"From chases on boats to bust-ups on buses, the action and locations are fitfully engaging, but the story feels cobbled together and the dialogue is often painful."
6584,21-and-over-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"Despite its collegiate setting, 21 and Over is pretty much for people with an IQ of 21 and under."
6585,the-sleepy-time-gal-movie,Dennis Lim,90,"Münch's characters are given to a certain rapt, unwieldy thoughtfulness, and accordingly, his films cultivate a mood of almost trancelike introspection."
6586,a-most-wanted-man-movie,Ty Burr,88,"The great pleasure of le Carré-land — for some, it’s the frustration — is that one’s own moral certainties are quickly stood on their head."
6587,chavez-movie,Bill Zwecker,75,It’s Pena’s quietly powerful interpretation of Cesar Chavez the man that makes this movie work so well.
6588,catch-and-release-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"The chick comedy-drama Catch and Release may look bland, but it's not. It's worse. To rise to the level of blandness, it would need to have a few gallons of Tabasco dumped into it."
6589,by-the-sea-movie,Rex Reed,25,"Looking lovely and catatonic, Angelina Jolie, who now calls herself Angelina Jolie Pitt, has come up with an exercise in self-indulgence for herself and husband Brad that is so boring it defies description. By the Sea is not only a dog; it’s a dog that’s got fleas."
6590,man-of-steel-movie,Charlie Schmidlin,75,"Goyer and Nolan have crafted in Man of Steel a taut, exploratory vision, and Snyder's later inheritance of the material indeed proves his best work since “Dawn of the Dead.” "
6591,oliver-twist-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,This is that rare movie version of a great novel in which watching IS reading.

6593,the-battle-of-algiers-re-release-movie,Ty Burr,100,The Battle of Algiers is a thinking person's action film in which there are winners -- but no heroes.
6594,once-upon-a-time-in-venice-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,20,A wincingly unfunny comedy caper.
6595,i-am-love-movie,Ty Burr,88,"If you're not in the mood, the whole thing will probably seem pretty silly. But if you are -- oh, if you are -- I Am Love may be the richest, tastiest truffle you're likely to savor all summer."

6598,hannah-and-her-sisters-movie,Staff (Not credited),63,"""It's one of the problems I have with Hannah. I feel I haven't gone deeply enough."" Should Woody Allen ever tire of making movies, he can take up criticizing them."
6599,bad-moms-movie,Sonia Rao,38,"This is no “Bridesmaids.” What the film’s premise has in novelty, it lacks in execution. The characters are uninspired, and they continue to lack depth and plausibility throughout. "
6600,the-constant-gardener-movie,Michael Atkinson,80,"Although le Carré's story may seem predictable and unduly focused on the plight of a pale, wealthy Old Worlder adrift in a sea of needy East Africans, the movie's human material is masterfully manipulated."
6601,miracles-from-heaven-movie,Jesse Hassenger,25,"Miracles From Heaven is too dramatically inert to oblige Garner with a great character, but it does offer plenty of tearful monologues and mini-monologues."
6602,finding-amanda-movie,Ty Burr,12,"Finding Amanda, unfortunately, is one vast, irritating surface."
6603,robin-hood-men-in-tights-movie,Christopher Harris,38,"Maybe Brooks has lost his touch, maybe some of us are getting too old to revel in toilet humour or maybe Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves was just too lousy a picture for Mel to bounce his manic slapstick from. Either way, Kevin Costner's earnestly self-important Robin Hood remains distinctly funnier, laugh for unintentional laugh, than Mel Brook's satirical one.[29 July 1993]"
6604,percy-jackson-the-olympians-the-lightning-thief-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"Director Chris Columbus has fun with this goofy premise, but as always I am distracted by the practical aspects of the story. Does it bother the Greek gods that no one any longer knows or cares that they rule the world? What are the genetic implications of human/god interbreeding?"
6605,black-rock-movie,Eric Kohn,75,"Black Rock never reinvents the rules, but it understands them just well enough to make its bloodless stabs at ingenuity stand out."
6606,far-from-the-madding-crowd-movie,Liam Lacey,63,Feels like a missed opportunity to do a country romantic melodrama in grand style.
6607,gods-own-country-movie,Justin Chang,100,"In the push-pull between Secareanu’s resonant stillness and O’Connor’s barely sublimated intensity, you feel the struggle of two souls forging a path toward each other, gradually realizing that while life may be harsh and unforgiving, love doesn’t have to be."
6608,the-accidental-tourist-movie,Roger Ebert,100,I've never seen a movie so sad in which there was so much genuine laughter. The Accidental Tourist is one of the best films of the year.
6609,peggy-sue-got-married-movie,Staff (Not Credited),75,"The film features good acting from almost everyone, the one notable exception being the annoying Cage who adopts a grating constricted voice for the role. "
6610,samson-movie,Joe Leydon,10,"Even if you’re willing to forgive the laughably fake beards, the unconvincing computer-generated imagery, and a man-versus-lion skirmish that might have embarrassed Ed Wood, the overall clunkiness of this enterprise may tempt you to shout rude things at the screen."
6611,w-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"In the end, W. makes up in immediacy what it lacks in objectivity."
6612,kingpin-movie,Rita Kempley,20,"Without a doubt, mainstream moviegoers will be revolted by the nastiness of it all."
6613,tims-vermeer-movie,Peter Travers,88,A stimulating detective story that holds you in thrall.
6614,big-bad-wolves-movie,Manohla Dargis,20,Is there a point? All the filmmakers seem interested in is the ugliness of the main Israeli characters.
6615,awesome-i-fuckin-shot-that!-movie,Bill White,25,"For the most part, the film is a chaotic blur of disconnected movement that re-creates the feeling of an unforgettably bad concert experience."
6616,the-brown-bunny-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,10,"In his second feature as a director, Gallo acts as writer, director, producer, star, cinematographer, production designer and editor. Thus, the failure is all his."
6617,blind-2017-movie,David Ehrlich,25,"Blind is bad for many reasons, chief among them how it contributes to the belittling notion that representation doesn’t matter for a demographic that will never be able to see themselves on screen."
6618,nurse-betty-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,The movie has a deliberately screw-loose feel.
6619,kids-in-the-hall-brain-candy-movie,Staff (Not Credited),0,The first movie from the cult television comedy troupe doesn’t have a single good laugh.
6620,dirty-love-movie,Mark Holcomb,0,"A kind of ""Sex and the City"" for L.A. bottom-feeders awash in clichéd, self-loathing misogyny that would make Howard Stern flinch."
6621,three-days-to-kill-movie,Stephen Whitty,25,It's a movie that's races from no place to get nowhere.
6622,game-over-man!-movie,Monica Castillo,10,"Game Over, Man! is a movie with few original ideas, plenty of tropes, and not enough love for the Bill Paxton “Aliens” character who made its eponymous catchphrase popular"
6623,little-boy-movie,Peter Keough,38,"The film is so bizarre, contrived, manipulative, and meretricious that anything is possible."
6624,the-wolverine-movie,Steven Rea,75,"Apart from Khodchenkova, who displays the acting acumen of a runway model and gives new meaning to the term Russian mole (she's the villainous vixen of the tale, suited up in high heels and slinky, scaly couture), the cast of The Wolverine is uniformly good."
6625,the-italian-job-movie,David Denby,70,"Good summer fun, but it’s only about two-thirds the picture it could have been. Since Edward Norton has nothing to play against, the rivalry at the heart of the movie never heats up.  [16 & 23 June 2003, p. 200]"
6626,life-and-debt-movie,Loren King,75,A searing documentary with an agenda.
6627,lost-embrace-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,70,The film takes a whimsical view of this insular and sometimes daft environment where everyone's eccentricities are given an opportunity to shine.
6628,where-the-wild-things-are-movie,Joe Williams,63,"To their credit, the creative team has retained the handmade look and unruly spirit of Maurice Sendak's bedtime fable; to their discredit, they haven't added enough narrative or emotional dimension to make it an effective movie."
6629,there-will-be-blood-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,100,There Will Be Blood is a masterpiece; Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as a ruthless oilman is without flaw.
6630,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,Ted Gideonse,10,"The dialogue is inane, the acting wooden, and Roger Christian's directing choices are a lesson in sci-fi film cliché."
6631,the-general-1998-movie,Joshua Klein,80,Credit director John Boorman with bringing a life like Cahill's to the screen with such acuity that it's easy to overlook the many familiar elements of his mobster movie. 
6632,the-saint-movie,Lisa Alspector,20,"This insufferable romance-adventure includes vague comedy as well as unintentional humor, and its target audience seems to be preadolescents who won't notice the calculated enthusiasm with which it sidesteps sexuality. "
6633,code-black-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,63,"The movie is at its best when it's immersing you in a series of conundrums and letting you feel what it's like to live with them, and wrestle with them. All of these people are doing the best they can, but the system is broken."
6634,sorority-boys-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"One element of Sorority Boys is undeniably good, and that is the title. Pause by the poster on the way into the theater. That will be your high point."
6635,innocence-2014-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"Innocence certainly has all the right genre conventions to toy with, but the haphazard script by Brougher and Tristine Skyler is a bloody mess."
6636,embrace-of-the-serpent-movie,Jordan Mintzer,80,"If the film runs a tad too long, especially in its second half, Embrace of the Serpent is still an absorbing account of indigenous tribes facing up to colonial incursions, revealing how Westerners are in many ways far behind the native peoples they conquer."
6637,tideland-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,38,"A murky swamp of a movie, Terry Gilliam's defiantly surreal Tideland finds every good idea drowning in an excess of indulgence."
6638,the-bodyguard-movie,Pamela Bruce,0,"Perhaps one of the most unbearable viewing experiences of the year, complete with a formulaic script, lousy acting, and muddled direction. "
6639,zodiac-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,90,"Firing on all cylinders as a creepy thriller, police procedural and ""All the President's Men""-style investigative newsroom drama, the smart, extremely vivid production oozes period authenticity."
6640,bridget-jones-the-edge-of-reason-movie,Carina Chocano,70,At its best at its most absurd.
6641,wakefield-movie,Sheila O'Malley,75,"Even though half of her screen time consists of her being seen but not heard, Garner has a consistent crispness; her character is simultaneously transparent and slightly enigmatic. "
6642,no-escape-movie,Stephanie Merry,37,"Every Asian character is either a ruthless murderer or anonymous collateral damage. A lot of locals have to die, the film suggests, in order for one white family to survive."
6643,the-clapper-movie,Rodrigo Perez,16,"Bafflingly witless, The Clapper is an oblivious non-starter with myriad deficiencies. Artless and clueless at every turn, writer/director Dito Montiel’s inane movie is a one-note half-gag somehow stretched into a painful 90-minute movie."
6644,parker-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,20,"The smidgen of dramatic color offered by Jennifer Lopez, as a divorced real-estate broker drawn into Parker's payback scheme, is offset by her character's shocking naïveté, shedding her clothes on command (as if she still couldn't hide a wire somewhere) and falling unconvincingly for Statham's featureless cipher."
6645,the-honeymooners-movie,Michael Wilmington,38,The movie suffers from a devastating flaw for a comedy: It isn't very funny.
6646,passengers-2016-movie,Barry Hertz,0,"What's worse than the actual movie itself, though, is how indicative it is of modern group-think studio production."
6647,real-women-have-curves-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,78,"Even though the storyline of Real Women Have Curves is a somewhat familiar tale, the film's originality lies in the way in which it's told."
6648,the-paperboy-movie,Scott Tobias,10,"The words ""florid"" and ""inert"" are not quite antonyms, but it would nonetheless seem impossible for those two adjectives to apply to the same thing. And yet here comes The Paperboy, a swamp noir so spectacularly incompetent that even the ripest pulp attractions are left to rot in the sun, flies buzzing lazily around them."
6649,formula-51-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"A muddled mess of bad-lad clichés, and Jackson's obvious talents only serve to point out how godawful everyone else seems to be."
6650,captain-corellis-mandolin-movie,Peter Rainer,30,"Based on an interminable 1994 international bestseller by Louis de Bernières that I found impossible to make my way through. The movie duplicates exactly my experience with the book, although I must say I was thankful to be spared serial outbreaks of hearty Greek dancing."
6651,tokyo!-movie,Maggie Lee,70,"Though these vignettes appear frivolous and inconsequential when set beside the directors' features, they will tickle the funny bones of a general audience. A safe choice for fantastic fests, worldwide cinemas will open to the kind of audiences who bought tickets to see ""Paris J'taime"" or ""To Each His Own Cinema."""
6652,race-movie,Brian Truitt,75,"Race makes its title's double meaning all too clear, and at a time when the Oscars and movies, in general, struggle with finding racial balance, two guys of different skin colors coming together for some sports-movie magic is a fitting and truly welcoming lapping of the competition."
6653,hulk-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Hulk represents the most involving superhero motion picture since ""Superman"" soared skywards in 1978. By taking its time to develop characters and situations, Hulk does what so many action/adventure movies fail to do -- allow us to really feel for the protagonists. "
6654,the-apostle-movie,Desson Thomson,100,"If you want to sample the sheer bouquet of great acting, you could get drunk on this movie."
6655,bossa-nova-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,80,"Despite the frivolous feel, it's clear the director intends for Bossa Nova to be a love letter to his two passions: Brazil and his leading lady (who's also his real-life wife). Neither lets him down."
6656,la-mission-movie,V.A. Musetto,25,Utterly predictable and full of trite dialogue.
6657,need-for-speed-movie,Peter Travers,38,There's nothing to distract you from a plot so tired there are tire tracks from other racing movies all over it.
6658,charlies-angels-full-throttle-movie,Jami Bernard,75,"This heavenly sequel, again directed by ""McG"" (aka Joseph McGinty Nichol), is infused with an irresistibly joyous spirit that simply cannot be faked."
6659,freedomland-movie,M. E. Russell,25,Freedomland is the worst kind of bad movie: one that thinks it's important.
6660,envy-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"The film is neither fish nor fowl nor some arresting new entity, but a lumpish coagulation of conflicting impulses and unrealized gestures."
6661,we-bought-a-zoo-movie,Richard Corliss,30,"Crowe has made a meretricious weepie that rouges the facts and defeats the attempts of Matt Damon, with his considerable charm and skill, to breathe some emotional truth into it. There's a word for the strenuous, shameless plucking of an audience's emotions that this movie traffics in: cornography."
6662,dracula-2000-movie,Peter Travers,10,"Dracula may stay undead in the new millennium, but there's not a sign of life - oh, that bloodless acting - in this sorry mess."
6663,the-black-power-mixtape-1967-1975-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"A tangy raw stew of history, even if it never begins to confront the contradictions that bedeviled black militancy."
6664,inside-llewyn-davis-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"But mainly, it’s the film’s folk music that roots in the heart like a faraway lure. "
6665,closed-curtain-movie,Jay Weissberg,70,"Less satisfying than his previous pic, yet still a bold, melancholy statement."
6666,wristcutters-a-love-story-movie,Michael Sragow,91,"Wristcutters: A Love Story is a lousy title for a lovely-loony picture about an afterlife for suicides. It's an off-road ""road movie"" about people who off themselves."
6667,biggie-and-tupac-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,"This time out, Broomfield comes up with maybe enough halfway decent material for a 10-minute segment on a second-rate tabloid TV show."
6668,nymphomaniac-volume-two-movie,Rene Rodriguez,63,"Much like the first film, Nymphomaniac Vol.2 isn’t remotely erotic or a turn-on — it’s a curiously intellectual experience that doesn’t move you below the neck, including the heart. "
6669,breach-movie,Scott Foundas,80,Here is one of the best American actors (Chris Cooper) in one of his best parts.
6670,the-emperors-club-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"Like the story, Kline builds in intensity: He has no flowery speeches that would be untrue to his character, but he leaves a clear impression of a man who values knowledge and the imparting of it above all else."
6671,isnt-she-great-movie,Ella Taylor,30,Lame comic-strip excuse for a biopic.
6672,time-out-movie,Sean Axmaker,100,"It's a chilly, lonely introduction to a man who has effectively stepped out of the social world of adult responsibility."
6673,the-virginity-hit-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,The Virginity Hit is repugnant.
6674,the-statement-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,Brit actors can't even be bothered to speak with French accents.
6675,chill-factor-movie,Kevin Thomas,30,Melts swiftly...don't expect a shred of credibility.
6676,the-cat-in-the-hat-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,10,Such a remarkable rift between its charming source material and its heinous cinematic realization that the producers may as well have skipped the hassle of securing licensing rights and simply called this mess Mike Myers: A--hole in Fur.
6677,waiting-movie,Sara Brady,0,"Waiting is, at its root, a heaping handful of almost-funny ideas cobbled together without much skill for shaping a story. The result is that one in five provokes a smile, while the other four make the viewers slightly sick that they now have to remember what they just saw."
6678,scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-movie,Shawn Levy,83,Wright and company do a splendid job of distilling it down to a fresh and entertaining joyride of a film.
6679,ripd-movie,Dana Stevens,30,"With its low-stakes chase scenes, obvious-from-the-get-go villains and nonsensical plotting, this feels more like a 96-minute-long episode of Scooby-Doo that's been laboriously translated into another language and then back into English. "
6680,the-heart-of-me-movie,J.R. Jones,90,Its intelligent characterizations make it one of the best movies I've seen this year. 
6681,the-female-brain-movie,Keith Watson,38,"The Female Brain never seems quite sure whether it wants to probe the depths of its title subject or just make us laugh. And given the shallowness of its quasi-scientific blather and the tepidness of its comedy, it ultimately does neither. "
6682,a-life-less-ordinary-movie,Marc Savlov,11,A Life Less Ordinary fails on so many levels it's nearly a textbook case of What Not to Do.
6683,i-heart-huckabees-movie,Rick Groen,63,"So I didn't Huckabees, nor did I entirely not it. Rather, when the end draws nigh and judgment beckons, I'm doomed again to dither in the tepid netherworld, that vast limbo where movies are only half-decent and movie-going is merely half-ed."
6684,the-florida-project-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Despite a seemingly straightforward slice-of-life storyline, The Florida Project achieves something rare and magical: presenting existence from the perspective of a young child while, at the same time, providing enough “clues” that viewers are able to decipher what’s really going on."
6685,mr-magoriums-wonder-emporium-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"Mr. Magorium, who is 243 years old (so are his jokes), is a cross between Willy Wonka and Geppetto, but Hoffman plays him with little more than a goofy dumb lisp, achieved by tucking his lower lip under his upper teeth, so that he looks just as rabbity-stoopid as he sounds."
6686,antitrust-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"It's too bad we don't have red, glowing DELETE buttons next to those soda cup holders. I could have done the world a favor."
6687,murder-by-numbers-movie,Bill Gallo,30,"Most obvious crime is first-degree dullness, giving us a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions."
6688,nine-lives-2016-movie,Steve Davis,0,The dialogue is enough to make your hair stand on end.
6689,the-life-of-david-gale-movie,Wesley Morris,25,"Positively reeks of self-importance -- the jokey, ham-fisted, pseudo-socially relevant, punch-pulling kind. It reeks worse of acting -- the Jack-Lemmon-in-a-coma Kevin Spacey kind. "
6690,the-cooler-movie,Ty Burr,75,"Looks brilliant while you're watching it and stands revealed as counterfeit only in the strong light of day. What Baldwin does, though, is the stuff of supporting actor Oscars. "
6691,project-x-movie,Andrew Schenker,12,"Awesomeness seems to be the chief quality prized by both the film and its characters; all other considerations--like safety, property damage, and especially good taste--are secondary."
6692,bridesmaids-movie,Joe Williams,88,"Kristen Wiig is the best sketch comic alive, and Bridesmaids should finally make her a movie star."
6693,american-pastoral-movie, Darren Ruecker,70,"American Pastoral doesn't quite nail its tone, but it's a compelling enough adaptation with a few truly inspired moments."
6694,keep-the-river-on-your-right-a-modern-cannibal-tale-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,88,A remarkable film about a remarkable man who's lived the kind of life usually reserved for adventure novels and pulp fiction.
6695,changeling-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Jolie is inspired casting. She plays the role like a gathering storm, moving from terror to a fierce resolve. And Eastwood, at the peak of his artful powers, tightens the screws of suspense without ever forgetting where the heart of his film lies."
6696,jarhead-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"It is not often that a movie catches exactly what it was like to be this person in this place at this time, but Jarhead does."
6697,21-grams-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"It's so laden with foreboding, you want to get out from under it and gasp for air."
6698,stealth-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,It's not new. It's not interesting. I wish it would go away.
6699,american-sniper-movie,Steve Persall,91,"Unlike many post 9/11 war movies, American Sniper goes easier on the gung ho, with a third act leavened by Chris' depressed denial, his ""hurt locker"" of stored regret. Eastwood is less concerned with action heroism than the consequences of deadly action, how it chips away at the living."
6700,max-payne-movie,Michael Sragow,38,"What kills Max Payne is that the characters think and feel in slow motion. Half the time, mentally, they're just running in place."
6701,cradle-2-the-grave-movie,Nathan Rabin,10,"Its creepy use of DMX's daughter is reprehensible, but the film is otherwise so unrelentingly sleazy that its use of the child-in-danger gambit actually qualifies as one of its subtler moves."
6702,enders-game-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,"Its strong special effects make its simulated battles effective and, echoing the book, its story line touches on a number of intriguing issues."
6703,a-christmas-carol-movie,Rick Groen,75,"This time, though, Zemeckis has another technical trick up his sleeve – 3-D – and for once the gimmick succeeds."
6704,safe-haven-movie,Chris Cabin,12,It goes without saying that Safe Haven is the whitest thing offered up for public consumption in the three days since Mumford & Sons won the Grammy for Album of the Year.
6705,high-fidelity-movie,Jami Bernard,88,"When director Stephen Frears worked with (Jack Black), he must have yelled ""Let 'er rip!"" instead of ""Action!"""
6706,super-troopers-2-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,20,"The sequel is so profound a buzzkill they could sell it at GNC as a detox kit. No high can survive it. It slays fun dead, grinds cannabinoids to dust, and maybe even wipes the mind of the warmth you might hold for the original Super Troopers."
6707,american-outlaws-movie,Staff (Not credited),33,Bogusly wholesome six-gun dud.
6708,black-and-white-movie,Pauline Adamek,5,When worlds collide - people yawn.
6709,match-point-movie,Richard Corliss,70,"When they get to canoodling and conniving, you won't ask for your money back."
6710,up-in-smoke-movie,Staff (Not Credited),75,"The funniest of all the Cheech and Chong movies, UP IN SMOKE provides a feast of gags for the sympathetically minded."
6711,buck-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"The character who emerges in the breezy, somewhat meandering Buck is plain-spoken, heartfelt, compassionate, witty, and wise.  His horse-training technique is based on understanding the psychology of animals and on attuning his human and equine clients with one another.  "
6712,frances-ha-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,"There is no particularly cathartic climax to Frances Ha. Instead there is a more realistic depiction of Frances’ growth. Like Gerwig’s performance, it’s natural, it’s realistic, perfectly believable."
6713,force-majeure-movie,Kimberley Jones,100,The film gets its biggest laughs – and there truly are some grandly bleak belly-shakers here – by upsetting the apple cart on traditional gender roles. 
6714,i-love-you-beth-cooper-movie,Scott Tobias,25,There’s hardly an authentic second in the film.
6715,the-secret-of-nimh-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"The Secret of NIMH is a richly animated and skillfully structured film created by former Disney animators Don Bluth, Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy. As craft, their first feature film is certainly an homage to the best of an age ago. "
6716,diana-movie,Cath Clarke,20,A right royal mess. 
6717,the-next-best-thing-movie,Stephen Holden,10,The moment the movie loses its lighthearted spirit is the moment it loses touch with reality
6718,goodbye-lenin!-movie,Ken Fox,80,"Marvelously entertaining, and occasionally brilliant, political satire. "
6719,the-mother-movie,Ruthe Stein,100,Daring in its affirmation that a dowdy woman in her late 60s still can let go of her inhibitions and exhibit a lascivious side. 
6720,shrek-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"This fractured fairy tale not only knows there's no substitute for clever writing, it also has the confidence to take that information straight to the bank."
6721,congo-movie,Liam Lacey,25,"Without Spielberg's technical pizazz, and with a gummy mixture of homage and spoof, Congo chokes on its own tongue in cheek."
6722,queen-of-katwe-movie,Brian Tallerico,75,"It seems unlikely that Phiona Mutesi ever imagined her life would one day be the subject of a Disney film. But she certainly learned that life is full of surprises. When it comes to movie surprises, Queen of Katwe is a truly pleasant one."
6723,hitman-agent-47-movie,Brian Tallerico,25,"Hitman: Agent 47 is aggressively awful, the kind of film that rubs its lackadaisical screenwriting, dull filmmaking and boring characters in your face, almost daring you to ask the theater operator for your money back."
6724,stealing-harvard-movie,Mike Clark,38,"When the most notable thing a film offers is the sight of Dennis Farina in drag, you can't expect much."
6725,munich-movie,James Berardinelli,100,"A film of uncommon depth, intelligence, and sensitivity."
6726,christine-1983-movie,Gary Arnold,70,"Christine does indeed suffer from the preposterous, low-octane nature of the devil-car pretext. But this satanic nonsense is saved from strictly facetious appeal by a few sensational pictorial effects, notably the sights of Christine speeding after a victim while engulfed in flames or miraculously repairing her own battered body, and by the no-nonsense performances of an excellent cast, especially Keith Gordon as the obsessed and transformed Arnie Cunningham. "
6727,this-is-the-end-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"There is stuff in This Is the End that had me laughing so hard, I sensed new body parts joining in to help out — my pancreas was heaving, my bile ducts ripped. "
6728,aferim!-movie,Mike D'Angelo,67,"To the extent that the film has an emotional journey, it’s the story of this man’s very, very slight moral awakening, which achieves nothing whatsoever and doesn’t necessarily look as if it’s going to stick."
6729,western-2017-movie,Carson Lund,75,"The absence of anything traditionally ""painterly"" reflects an ambivalent attitude toward the kind of capitalistic pro-growth machinations on display in the film."
6730,brokeback-mountain-movie,Ty Burr,88,"Brokeback may be too polished for some people, too elegantly dispassionate in its study of choked passion."
6731,the-next-best-thing-movie,Robert Horton,10,"A dismal film, a flop as both 21st-century romantic comedy and gay ""Kramer vs. Kramer."""
6732,the-nice-guys-movie,Alonso Duralde,72,"There’s a tipping point at which comedy goes from black to bilious, and that’s a balancing act that The Nice Guys doesn’t always nail. The laughs from this frequently entertaining action comedy get stuck in the throat, keeping this altogether good movie from being a great one."
6733,sammy-and-rosie-get-laid-movie,Sheila Benson,10,"Stunningly, ponderously bad."
6734,stuart-saves-his-family-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"Whatever goodwill Stuart Saves His Family manages to work up disappears by the maudlin, dramatic finale. [14 Apr 1995, p.5G]"
6735,broadway-danny-rose-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Broadway Danny Rose uses all of the basic ingredients of Damon Runyon's Broadway: the pathetic acts looking for a job, the guys who get a break and forget their old friends, the agents with hearts of gold, the beautiful showgirls who fall for Woody Allen types, the dumb gangsters, big shots at the ringside tables (Howard Cosell plays himself). It all works."
6736,straight-jacket-movie,V.A. Musetto,25,"The game cast tries desperately to be funny, but Day hasn't provided them with the material."
6737,from-dusk-till-dawn-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez had their fun with From Dusk Till Dawn, and now they need to stay away from each other. For their own good. Forever."
6738,monster-in-law-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"To boost this movie's rating to ""worth seeing"" would make me feel like a publicist or simply a dope."
6739,moulin-rouge!-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"A landmark musical movie -- controversial, mercurial, even cheeky. It's the kind of film that wildly divides audiences and critics -- people tend to either love or hate it. I loved it."
6740,lies-movie,J. Hoberman,70,"At once distanced and heedless, Lies manages to be lighter and less pretentious than any description suggests. The movie's playful aspect can't be denied."
6741,the-rewrite-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,"Lawrence’s script for The Rewrite could have used one, and his direction is uneven, but it’s still rewarding watching Grant dispensing his dithery charm surrounded by old pros."
6742,introducing-the-dwights-movie,Wesley Morris,38,"Nothing about this movie works, not the title (it used to be called ""Clubland ""), not Blethyn's attempt to inject comedy into her rickety stereotype of a character."
6743,beautiful-movie,Ella Taylor,20,"Made with the slick, shorthand complacency of a TV movie, Beautiful is so overstuffed with contrivance, you can hardly breathe."
6744,once-upon-a-time-in-anatolia-movie,Eric Kohn,91,"Nuri Bilge Ceylan's mesmerizing Once Upon a Time in Anatolia plays like ""Zodiac"" meets ""Police, Adjective."""
6745,hard-candy-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,"Tautly directed by David Slade, this drama probably offers more sadism than anyone could possibly want...The characters are absurd, but if you're up for this sort of thing, then surely you can con yourself into accepting them. Personally, I'd rather have this movie obliterated from my memory."
6746,our-little-sister-movie,A.O. Scott,90,"Seeming to wander through small incidents and mundane busyness, it acquires momentum and dramatic weight through a brilliant kind of narrative stealth. You are shaken, by the end, at how much you care about these women and how sorry you are to leave their company."
6747,we-movie,Richard Corliss,0,It's a shame that W.E. smells so bad.
6748,monsoon-wedding-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,"The old-world-meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie's soundtrack, a joyful effusion of disco Bollywood that, by the end of Monsoon Wedding, sent my spirit soaring out of the theater."
6749,king-of-california-movie,James Berardinelli,63,The movie develops in two pieces - one dealing with the quest for the hidden riches and once concentrating on the relationship between father and daughter. The latter works; the former doesn't.
6750,surrogates-movie,David Hiltbrand,38,"Surrogates, which borrows tone and content freely from ""I, Robot,"" is all windup and no pitch."
6751,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,J. Hoberman,20,The movie's mode is brutal and excremental.
6752,far-from-heaven-movie,Stephen Hunter,30,"The movie has the sense of being embalmed, or pickled. With its stilted dialogue not quite kitschy enough to be funny and not quite authentic enough to be realistic, the whole movie feels as if it's taking place in formaldehyde."
6753,the-music-of-strangers-yo-yo-ma-and-the-silk-road-ensemble-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,80,The music and the group are uplifting. The stories are inspiring.
6754,bee-season-movie,Ella Taylor,70,"McGehee and Siegel's ornate structure and editing stay just this side of tricky, as does their borderline-goofy use of special effects to make us see the world (and the words) through Eliza's anxious eyes."
6755,standard-operating-procedure-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"While this does not strike me as the most urgent element of Standard Operating Procedure, Morris makes a persuasive case that many of the Abu Ghraib photos don't show us what we think they do, and that some of the episodes depicted were staged specifically to be photographed (and might not otherwise have occurred)."
6756,taken-3-movie,Bilge Ebiri,20,Taken 3 is bad enough that it may just end it.
6757,armadillo-movie,A.O. Scott,80,"The achievement of this film is to forestall and complicate easy judgment. You emerge shaken and bothered, which may sound like a reason not to see the movie. It is actually the opposite. "
6758,year-one-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,30,Year One sets prehistoric comedy back at least 20 years.
6759,freddy-got-fingered-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"The movie is simply not professional. It's not, even by the lowest standards of Republic B-westerns in the '30s or bad, cheap horror films in the '50s, releasable."
6760,chill-factor-movie,Andy Klein,10,As worthless a piece of garbage as we've seen this year. 
6761,for-a-good-time-call-movie,Jess Righthand,38,"Even if a good phone-sex movie does exist, For a Good Time, Call . . .  is woefully, definitively not it."
6762,super-movie,Andrea Gronvall,30,"This movie is too pedestrian for camp, and too scattershot for an action comedy. "
6763,jawbreaker-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"Why sit through a lesser imitation, when you could just rent ""Heathers"" and those other movies for a far more enjoyable time? Drop-dead bitchery? Been there, done that."
6764,saving-grace-movie,Jay Carr,63,"It's funny and charming most of the time, thanks to Brenda Blethyn."
6765,i-origins-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"Brit Marling, who starred in and co-wrote Cahill’s debut feature, “Another Earth,” is very good as Ian’s lab assistant and eventual wife, and a young Indian girl named Kashish, a nonactress I would guess, is unforgettable. "
6766,tomorrow-never-dies-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"There is plenty of bang-bang but very little kiss-kiss in Tomorrow Never Dies, a solid but somewhat by-the-numbers entry in the James Bond cycle."
6767,2016-obamas-america-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,38,"D'Souza makes it all sound almost plausible, but only if you're predisposed to believe that Obama hates America. It's bashing, all right, but with a velvet-gloved fist."
6768,the-naked-gun-from-the-files-of-police-squad!-movie,Rita Kempley,80,"You have the right to remain silent. But if you do, call 911 -- your funny bone is busted. [2 Dec 1988]"
6769,motherhood-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"If Carrie Bradshaw ever trades her Manolos for sneakers and starts blogging about raising children, I pray she wouldn't be as tiresome as the heroine of Katherine Dieckmann's insufferable comedy Motherhood."
6770,kick-ass-movie,Marc Mohan,83,Director Matthew Vaughn has provided an imperfect but still wickedly hilarious take on Mark Millar's deconstruction of superhero mythos.
6771,air-america-movie,Caryn James,0,"This muddled film about a secret C.I.A. project in Laos in 1969 fails on every possible level: as action film, as buddy film, as scenic travelogue and even, sad to say, as a way to flaunt Mel Gibson's appeal."
6772,norbit-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,0,"Compared to Norbit, “Date Movie” is ""Casablanca."" If I thought hijacking a plane carrying prints of the film and crashing it into Murphy’s house would put a stop to it, I’d go out and buy a box cutter right now."
6773,bicentennial-man-movie,Richard Corliss,30,"The tone is cloying, the running time bloated."
6774,the-family-movie,Gabe Toro,25,"The Family is ultimately a headache, nearly two hours of baseball bat beatings and dull witticisms, with zero inventiveness or energy."
6775,the-breakfast-club-movie,Joe Brown,70,"Their conversations give The Breakfast Club its snap, crackle and pop. And this is that rare movie that could benefit from another half hour of talking time. [15 Feb 1985]"
6776,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,Robert Horton,10,"The film is Travolta's baby, but indifference and boredom is everywhere."
6777,1208-east-of-bucharest-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"Though it is modest, almost anecdotal, in scale, 12:08 East of Bucharest is also characterized by a precise and sneaky formal wit."
6778,the-omen-1976-movie,Staff (Not Credited),80,Suspenser starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as the unwitting parents of the Antichrist. Richard Donner's direction is taut. Players all are strong.
6779,galaxy-quest-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"More than one joke or one idea. It's a thoroughly satisfying comedy --and a respectable space adventure, as well."
6780,in-out-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"Aside from Dillon, who brightens every scene he's in, the delightful surprise here is Selleck, who brings wonderfully mischievous, energizing and self-deprecating qualities to the role of the dirt-digging but ultimately on-the-level broadcaster."
6781,citizen-kane-1941-movie,Pauline Kael,100,"The Orson Welles film is generally considered the greatest American film of the sound period, and it may be more fun than any other great movie."
6782,the-sweetest-thing-movie,Michael Dequina,30,"A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers-style, down-and-dirty laugher for the female set."
6783,chappaquiddick-movie,Rex Reed,88,"Several aspects of this sad, grim story remain a mystery, but I am pleased to report that for the most part, Chappaquiddick catalogues the facts and eschews the sensationalism. The result is a film of integrity and disclosure, a controversial chapter in American history that substitutes clinical accuracy for Hollywood embellishment, with an impressive attention to detail and an admirable respect for suspenseful narrative. "
6784,the-heat-movie,Joel Arnold,90,"If The Heat is about more than being a well-oiled delivery system for impressive and effective comedy, it's in part about what it means to be a good cop — including the question of how gender does or doesn't factor into that."
6785,the-bleeder-movie,Nigel M Smith,80,Falardeau draws exceptional character work from his cast.
6786,sunlight-jr-movie,Sara Stewart,75,It’s slightly tough to get onboard with the regal Naomi Watts sporting badly sprayed hair and frosted lipstick; surely there are more flattering shades at the Walgreens?
6787,hanna-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,63,"The single most compelling reason to see Hanna is Hanna herself. As played by Saoirse Ronan, who made her first big splash as another morally challenged youngster in Wright's 2007 ""Atonement,"" the character is a fascinating and frustrating cipher."
6788,breakfast-on-pluto-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"May be Jordan's wildest mis-shot yet, so dense with dying fizzle and limp ideas that I began to wonder if Jordan has an evil twin, or if there are in fact several Neil Jordans, among them at least one literate stylist and one humor-handicapped village idiot."
6789,jesus-camp-movie,Marrit Ingman,78,"It's a call to arms, a call to pick sides in the deepening cultural, political, and spiritual schism between the two Americas of the 21st century."
6790,you-instead-movie,Chris Cabin,25,The film's narrative conceit is so rigidly formulaic and lethargically spun that even the looseness and spontaneity that the setting affords feels dull and constricting.
6791,once-upon-a-time-in-anatolia-movie,Andrew Schenker,38,Nuri Bilge Ceylan has to be the least kinetic of working filmmakers - and not simply in the sense of static camerawork or lack of narrative momentum.
6792,american-hustle-movie,David Rooney,100,An infectious blast of funky jazz played by a terrific cast and a director at the top of their respective games.
6793,hell-ride-movie,Ruthe Stein,25,A pile of junk.
6794,air-america-movie,Dave Kehr,25,"The confusing screenplay, by John Eskow and Richard Rush, makes a few fumbling attempts to get a plot going (Downey crash-lands and has to be rescued by Gibson; later, their CIA bosses try to frame them for drug smuggling), but mainly the movie tries to get by on attitude, which is a mistake when Mel Gibson is its main perpetrator. [10 Aug 1990]"
6795,warm-water-under-a-red-bridge-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,"A movie about love, friendship and finding oneself, and it takes all its subjects very seriously while seeming to treat them with the lightest and most piquant of touches. Like its bizarre heroine, it irrigates our souls."
6796,fathers-day-movie,Stephen Hunter,20,"A lamebrained American remake of the classic, bitter French farce ""Les Comperes,"" Fathers' Day offers sporadic laughs of the lowest kind -- the old outhouse-bites-man thing -- but some conspicuous idiocy as well."
6797,the-bitter-pill-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Side Effects is mostly a good Saturday-night movie, but by the end, it's caused a few unintended side effects of its own: a bit of head-scratching, and a giggle or two of disbelief."
6798,toy-story-3-movie,Tasha Robinson,100,"The film never lets banter, visual gags, or the usual manic kid-flick running about interfere with its more delicately handled thoughts on loyalty, longing, broken relationships, and generational continuity. It honestly earns its emotion, moment by painstakingly executed moment."
6799,road-hard-movie,Stephanie Merry,37,"You can make a movie that’s both sweet and crass; just look at Judd Apatow’s comedies. But the mix doesn’t work here, maybe because both the vulgarity and the cheesiness are so amped up."
6800,anger-management-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,"A ragged piece of filmmaking, but the odds are you'll have as good a time watching it as Nicholson and Sandler seemed to have making it. "
6801,the-last-sentence-movie,Glenn Kenny,88,A remarkably full-bodied and frank character study that illuminates the old saw about the political being personal in a genuinely unusual way. 
6802,star-wars-the-clone-wars-movie,Hank Stuever,30,Unfolds with all the entertainment value of watching somebody else play a video game.
6803,monsters-inc-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"Movies like Monsters, Inc. literally make you feel like a kid again, marveling at the joyously inventive sights before you, and that's a feat that should not be taken lightly."
6804,since-otar-left-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Working with excellent site-specific music and this trio of exemplary -- and exceptionally well-cast -- actresses, director Bertuccelli does a superb job of touching just the right emotional notes in recounting the consequences of deception and the importance of family."
6805,into-the-blue-movie,Lawrence Toppman,25,"Not even the repeated sight of Jessica Alba in a bikini, the camera caressing her like the eyes of a strip-club patron, can lift this leaden refuse off the ocean floor."
6806,dumb-and-dumber-to-movie,Stephen Whitty,16,"Occasionally, particularly when it sticks to simple slapstick, the movie wins a laugh. But the majority of it isn't just dumb and dumber, or even crude and cruder. At nearly two hours, it's just dull — and duller."
6807,whiskey-tango-foxtrot-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"WTF is on the right track, even if it never pulls all the way in to the station."
6808,catwoman-movie,Winda Benedetti,16,A cinematic cat-astrophe. 
6809,deliver-us-from-evil-movie,Carrie Rickey,100,"Courageous, shattering and exceptional documentary."
6810,88minutes-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"This slimy, slug-minded mystery thriller starts out dead on arrival and then, like three-day-old fish, gets really bad really fast."
6811,whats-your-number-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"She's hopeless, he's hopeless, and this movie is just ghastly."
6812,burning-bush-movie,Scout Tafoya,100,"In the end, all that can be relied upon are objects and gestures. The littlest things that tie us to each other. The film often slows to a standstill to show children playing, cars passing, people talking and streets emptied of traffic."
6813,at-middleton-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"Small as it is, the film itself functions as a catchy, bittersweet waltz. You've heard it before, but the dancers are fun to watch."
6814,im-gonna-git-you-sucka-movie,Desson Howe,10,Wayans' choosing to play romantic lead seems more narcissistic than smartly comic (watch him unleash those built biceps once too often); he lacks an unidentifiable shtick. And he seems too easily satisfied with predictable and sophomoric punchlines. Lapses like that give Sucka the Shaft.
6815,new-suit-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,80,New Suit is devilishly good fun. 
6816,hacksaw-ridge-movie,Phil de Semlyen,80,"Occasionally soapy on the homefront but cataclysmic in combat, this is a worthy addition to the WWII canon. Garfield underpins it all with skill, showing that sometimes, war can be humanising too. "
6817,open-range-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"Nobody smells of sagebrush, campfire coffee, tobacco (smoked or chewed) and saddle soap like Duvall."
6818,harlem-nights-movie,Chris Dafoe,0,"As it stands, Murphy has put his idols and friends in front of a camera, given them a watered down version of The Sting and hoped they'd make the best of it. They don't. [23 Nov 1989, p.C12]"
6819,captain-fantastic-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,"Captain Fantastic isn’t only one of the year’s best movies, but one of the best cast and best acted, right down to the smaller roles."
6820,ponyo-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,100,"Don't tell Walt Disney, but Hayao Miyazaki really holds the keys to the magic kingdom."
6821,the-lure-movie,Russ Fischer,83,"Crafted as a kaleidoscope of color and nightclub sparkle, The Lure's glitter does not distract from the fact that this is a technically confident and often quite accomplished piece of filmmaking, with a rare ability to dance intuitively between linear plotting and phantasmagoric fantasy."
6822,the-salt-of-the-earth-movie,Rodrigo Perez,91,The Salt of The Earth is a mesmeric and unforgettable look at the world and it sufferings through the eyes of a remarkably insightful and honorable artist.
6823,the-distinguished-gentleman-movie,Julie Salamon,70,"With a refreshing absence of earnestness, the movie mainly spins out many variations on a theme: Easy Street begins and ends on Capitol Hill. [03 Dec 1992]"
6824,the-circle-2017-movie,Richard Roeper,38,I don’t think you and I need to connect on InstaSkypeChatFaceSnapTweeterBook for you to understand I’m saying we’ve seen this movie before. It’s just usually not this smug or condescending or muddled or inconsistent.
6825,in-bruges-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"Sharply written, superbly acted, funny and even occasionally touching."
6826,the-wind-rises-movie,Hannah Lamarque,80,"Unlike many of Miyazaki's previous works, The Wind Rises is a film rooted far more firmly in realism. Although it does have its fair share of fantastical dream sequences and magical flying machines."
6827,blue-crush-movie,Sean Axmaker,75,"A summer movie that knows it's a summer movie. You don't go to this film for the story, but for the scenery: Bikini-clad girls riding waves, surf photography as beautiful as it is breathtaking, sun, surf, sand, even a little PG-13 romance."
6828,ellie-parker-movie,Nathan Rabin,30,"It almost seems that Watts made a movie this intentionally scuzzy and low-rent as a severe form of penance to the gods of authenticity for the sin of making millions jet-setting around the world appearing in big, glamorous super-productions. But she goes too far in making the audience suffer as well."
6829,la-la-land-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"The real star in La La Land is the movie itself, which pulses and glows like a living thing in its own right, as if the MGM musicals of the “Singin’ in the Rain” era had a love child with the more abstract confections of Jacques Demy, creating a new kind of knowing, self-aware genre that rewards the audience with all the indulgences they crave...while commenting on them from the sidelines."
6830,drop-dead-gorgeous-movie,Marc Savlov,0,This biting parody of flyover-state beauty contests feels like a bad made-for-TV movie of the week.
6831,mr-magoo-movie,John Anderson,30,Crashingly unimaginative. But its real offense is making such poor use of Nielsen.
6832,half-past-dead-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,38,"The martial arts are well represented, the gentler arts -- like, for example, acting -- are not."
6833,inequality-for-all-movie,Kerry Lengel,80,An engaging film that’s head and shoulders above the average talking-head parade.
6834,shes-out-of-my-league-movie,Carrie Rickey,63,"Fortunately, the actors are so likable that these wincingly unfunny moments don't spoil the party."
6835,bless-the-child-movie,Mark Holcomb,0,A callous piece of work that exploits images of children in pain or jeopardy.
6836,the-myth-of-the-american-sleepover-movie,Rex Reed,0,"The movie is so clueless and time-warped it could be comprised of outtakes from ""Father Knows Best."" "
6837,collateral-damage-movie,Todd McCarthy,10,"More than an embarrassment, it's an insult."
6838,maria-full-of-grace-movie,Steven Rea,100,"Moreno, with her wide, watchful eyes, owns the camera - and the film. Her performance is perfectly natural and profoundly moving. Maria Full of Grace is a remarkable picture, full of suspense and discovery."
6839,thats-my-boy-movie,Michael Phillips,0,"Even with 87.5 years to go, the 21st century may never see a stupider comedy than That's My Boy."
6840,dog-days-2018-movie,Derek Smith,25,"Aside from the occasional idiosyncratic comic beat, Dog Days remains committed to coloring within the lines of established tropes in the animal-centric family film."
6841,the-ladies-man-movie,Wesley Morris,25,"As movies about relic sex machines go, this one lacks mojo."
6842,georgia-rule-movie,Liam Lacey,0,"Director Marshall ( Pretty Woman) has created a comic drama so confused in tone, the actors often seem to be acting in different movies."
6843,twelve-movie,Peter Debruge,10,Can't decide if it's a cautionary tale or a lifestyle catalog.
6844,hellboy-ii-the-golden-army-movie,Michael Sragow,75,"Del Toro stuffs the film with wit and wonderments. Yet, coming out this superhero summer, it plays like a lovingly crafted synthesis of every fantasy saga we've seen in the past decade."
6845,the-emoji-movie-movie,Matt Singer,10,"There are plenty of words that can describe The Emoji Movie. Here are a few of them: Unfunny. Saccharine. Nonsensical. Painful. And, of course, crappy. (If you prefer the poop emoji, that works too.)"
6846,riding-giants-movie,Staff (Not credited),100,"A more sober, less in-your-face documentary than Peralta's great skateboarding flick."
6847,revolver-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,"This 2005 feature offered me my first taste of Guy Ritchie's macho-centric artiness, and I hope it's my last."
6848,the-deep-end-of-the-ocean-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"The movie's a floating longboat that ought to be ignited and pushed out to sea, Viking style."
6849,alex-cross-movie,Drew Taylor,16,"Alex Cross is more boring than your average weeknight procedural, except much longer, dumber and more violent."
6850,herods-law-movie,Wesley Morris,88,"Incisive, highly entertaining political farce."
6851,answers-to-nothing-movie,Amy Biancolli,25,"The result is a diligent brand of gloom. When it isn't being diligently gloomy, it's being obvious. When it isn't being obvious, it's being sneaky, and when it isn't being sneaky, it's marching toward a climax of B-movie violence, stupidity and nuttiness that summarily bumps off the movie's least annoying character."
6852,babies-movie,David Denby,70,"The filmmakers register their point, but I don’t think it’s entirely parochial to note that, two decades from now, the American and Japanese children will probably have many choices open to them (including living close to the land), while the Mongolian and Namibian children are more likely to be restricted in their choices to the soil that nurtured them."
6853,derailed-movie,Kyle Smith,12,Train wreck.
6854,rebels-of-the-neon-god-movie,Clayton Dillard,88,"Tsai Ming-liang's debut makes one yearn for an alternative reality where it, not Pulp Fiction, became the beacon of '90s independent filmmaking."
6855,meeks-cutoff-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,Meek's Cutoff is an ambitious feat of visual storytelling that's alive to both its landscape and the actors who people it.
6856,jimmy-p-movie,Jordan Hoffman,30,It’s just boring – and boring in a way that apparently has no endgame.
6857,toy-story-3-movie,Joe Neumaier,100,"While the vocal performances of Hanks, Allen and company make up a perfect ensemble, and its visual leaps astound, TS3's real power sneaks up on you."
6858,jigsaw-movie,Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,16,"By now, you likely already know whether or not Jigsaw is for you. The series is nothing if not consistent, but the diminishing returns that led to its near-decade hiatus only continue here."
6859,little-nicky-movie,Robert Wilonsky,0,"Little Nicky will redefine the phrase ""worst movie ever,"" because it might actually be the worst movie ever."
6860,prime-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"This may sound like Woody Allen - in fact, it often feels like Woody Allen (minus the expected helpings of angst) - but it's not. Prime is from writer/director Ben Younger and, while it's not up to the level of Allen's great romantic comedies (""Annie Hall,"" ""Manhattan""), it's better than anything the acclaimed New York auteur has brought to the screen in recent years."
6861,ever-after-movie,Keith Phipps,10,"It's... directed by Andy Tennant (""It Takes Two"") with all the flair of an episode of ""7th Heaven"", making it that much more worth avoiding."
6862,the-mountain-between-us-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"The annoyingly coy title of this non-epic about two people trying to survive a private plane crash in the high Rockies while a passive sort of romance develops during the descent pretty much says it all while simultaneously offering nothing of any great interest, much like the entire movie."
6863,a-million-ways-to-die-in-the-west-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"That’s not to say that MacFarlane’s film isn’t funny, but rather that his creative talent could benefit from more judicious editing and focus. MacFarlane’s id runs rampant with no signs of a superego (internal or external) to rein it in."
6864,the-devil-wears-prada-movie,Carina Chocano,70,"The Devil Wears Prada spins Weisberger's rant into a sharp, surprisingly funny excursion into the catty realm of women's magazines. The movie skips the condescension usually aimed at this world in favor of rapt observation."
6865,the-salt-of-the-earth-movie,Jay Weissberg,90,Wim Wenders’ mastery of the documentary form is again on display in The Salt of the Earth.
6866,the-wolfpack-movie,Amy Nicholson,90,The Wolfpack is more like a diorama of the Angulos' unusual childhood than an explanatory documentary.
6867,marmaduke-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,25,The movie itself is already like one long commercial.
6868,first-they-killed-my-father-movie,Soren Andersen,100,"Jolie draws restrained, naturalistic performances from her all-Cambodian cast, particularly young Sareum Srey Moch. There’s a stillness and a stoicism in her portrayal that makes her an unforgettable figure in this unforgettable movie."
6869,human-flow-movie,Matt Fagerholm,100,"Though Donald Trump is never mentioned by name in all 140 minutes of Ai Weiwei’s new documentary, Human Flow, the picture is, quite simply, the most monumental cinematic middle finger aimed at his scandal-laden administration to date."
6870,percy-jackson-the-olympians-the-lightning-thief-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"As scripted by Craig Titley, this first in a presumptive franchise is a dull, scattershot affair that owes much to both ""X-Men"" and Greek mythology, but which never seems to slow down enough to make any sense whatsoever."
6871,selma-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,100,"With Selma, DuVernay has pulled off a tricky feat, a movie based on historical events that never feels dull, worthy, or lifeless; it hangs together as a story and not just part of a lesson plan. The movie is at once intimate and grand in scope."
6872,xxx-movie,Keith Phipps,70,"Diesel clearly has fun playing a character so bullish that his skin seems to be made of leather, and he's self-conscious enough to pull it off even after the film surrenders to formula."
6873,session-9-movie,Michael Atkinson,80,"May not quite be more than the sum of its creepy parts, but as a reality-is-fear launch into workaday darkness, it clearly points toward the horror genre's best destiny."
6874,the-real-cancun-movie,Mark Caro,0,"This movie thrusts you so close to these intoxicated idiots that you practically have to wipe off secondhand tequila, sweat and spit stains afterward."
6875,domino-movie,David Edelstein,0,Domino seemed to me the end of the world for movies--a glimpse of a future so excruciating that I'd prefer to take my chances with Hitchcock's eye-gouging avians.
6876,words-and-pictures-movie,Stephen Holden,80,"Words and Pictures has a host of flaws, but the performances by Mr. Owen and Ms. Binoche have a crackling vitality, and the screenplay’s strongest moments set off the kind of trains of thought that dedicated teachers hope to spur in their students."
6877,inferno-movie,Bilge Ebiri,10,Take the Dan Brown out of a Dan Brown movie and all you’re left with is Tom Hanks jogging in mild irritation.
6878,redoubtable-movie,Barry Hertz,38,"There are good intentions lurking here, especially in star Louis Garrel’s performance, but the film consistently fails to engage on an even basic level. "
6879,the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"There are probably enough moments to satisfy hard-core fans, but for the rest of us, this amounts to the Middle Earth equivalent of  “Star Wars: Episode II —  Attack of the Clones,’’ a space-holding, empty-headed epic filled with characters and places (digital and otherwise) that are hard to keep straight,  much less care about."
6880,obsessed-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"The movie’s most disturbing aspect, of which the filmmakers could not have been unaware, is the physical resemblance between Mr. Elba and Ms. Larter to O. J. and Nicole Brown Simpson. It lends Obsessed a distasteful taint of exploitation."
6881,frankie-and-johnny-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,88,"Last time, director Garry Marshall gave us the fairy tale with Pretty Woman. This time, he gets the story right. [11 Oct 1991, p.1D]"
6882,assassins-creed-movie,Jonathan L. Fischer,10,"I suppose you could say the film made me slightly more likely to play one of the games, but only because I’d do just about anything before I saw this movie again."
6883,the-aristocrats-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"The Aristocrats has a lot of laughs, but as it giggles and blasphemes its way into areas not so far removed from the scandalous landscape of the Marquis de Sade, the movie, funny as it is, becomes exhausting and a bit depressing."
6884,the-twilight-saga-new-moon-movie,Jessica Baxter,0,"It’s intellectually and socially detrimental to both literature and cinema, simultaneously."
6885,jason-x-movie,Owen Gleiberman,16,"It will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary. But here's the real damn: It isn't funny, either."
6886,twisted-movie,Michael Sragow,100,Twisted is an unusual forensic crime film because it's witty and sophisticated as well as taut and creepy.
6887,stand-up-guys-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"It's long on Viagra jokes and whorehouse scenes, and comes up short on plausibility."
6888,jeepers-creepers-ii-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Hopefully, someone will grab the torch and, if not run with it, at the very least track down and set fire to the highly combustible prints of this inexcusably inept yawn-a-thon - it's not so much bad as it is unfathomable."
6889,saint-john-of-las-vegas-movie,Chris Nashawaty,16,"With stars like Steve Buscemi and Sarah Silverman and big-fish producers such as Spike Lee and Stanley Tucci on board, you'd think this indie would offer some glimmer of wit or originality. Think again."
6890,todays-special-movie,J.R. Jones,70,Appealing restaurant comedy.
6891,toy-story-2-movie,Todd McCarthy,90,"Toy Story 2 is to ""Toy Story"" what ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was to its predecessor, a richer, more satisfying film in every respect."
6892,zero-dark-thirty-movie,James Rocchi,90,A masterwork from a master filmmaker.
6893,roxanne-movie,Hal Hinson,90,"Roxanne is the most unabashed, and most satisfying, romantic movie to come along in years. It's a swooning, delicate, heart-on-its-sleeve work. And so fulsome is its tenderness and naivete' that it requires a leap of imagination from the viewer to get on its wavelength. Few recent movies, though, reward the stretch as this one does."
6894,mondovino-movie,Ken Fox,70,"Hugely entertaining, globe-trotting documentary."
6895,the-heart-of-the-game-movie,Claudia Puig,88,It captures an authentic feel-good spirit and inspirational message that most Hollywood movies barely approximate.
6896,transsiberian-movie,Jenni Miller,88,This is one train that you shouldn't miss.
6897,mousehunt-movie,Jeannie Stein,10,Just plain bad.
6898,fathers-daughters-movie,Tim Robey,20,"The level of psychological nuance in Desch’s script, not to mention feminist enlightenment, makes EL James look like Virginia Woolf."
6899,how-to-be-single-movie,Richard Roeper,88,"It’s one of the most endearing romantic comedies in recent memory, with some laugh-out-loud dialogue, gorgeous photography and uniformly charming performances from the entire cast."
6900,the-mummy-tomb-of-the-dragon-emperor-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"Little more than a cluttered, noisy, and unsatisfying thrill ride to nowhere."
6901,glass-chin-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,Corey Stoll is the only reason to sit through this muddled Jersey-set drama.
6902,rescue-dawn-movie,J. Hoberman,70,"Rescue Dawn is the closest thing to a ""real"" movie that Herzog has ever made. The lone conquistador has joined the club. Rescue Dawn is a Rambo movie without the Man (who, if I remember my Rambology, was himself of German descent)."
6903,land-of-the-lost-movie,Lou Lumenick,12,"Will Ferrell's terminally stupid, sloppy, campy and cheesy -- and thoroughly unexciting and unfunny -- experiment in ""family entertainment."""
6904,teeth-movie,Carina Chocano,80,"Campy, shameless and sophisticated, Lichtenstein's debut is gutsy and original, and it makes ""Juno"" look positively tame by comparison."
6905,the-gospel-according-to-philip-k-dick-movie,A.O. Scott,30,The documentary doesn't get near the prowess of its subject; it passes through your life like a minor daydream.
6906,escape-from-planet-earth-movie,Aaron Hillis,0,Escape From Planet Earth makes a compelling case for our disposable culture to finally get wiped out by malevolent aliens.
6907,x-men-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"Isn't juvenile, it isn't even infantile. It's prenatal!"
6908,the-signal-2014-movie,Nathan Rabin,30,"The Signal would desperately like to be a film of ideas, but the few it presents are vapid and secondhand. Eubank’s overachieving work on the film suggests he’s destined for bigger and better things, though given the airy nothingness of the film’s mind games, that’s setting the bar awfully low."
6909,the-bands-visit-movie,Ken Fox,88,"A remote, Israeli desert town is the setting for this droll, endearing comedy about an accidental cultural exchange that very quietly says some very important things about contemporary Arab-Israeli relations."
6910,hillarys-america-the-secret-history-of-the-democratic-party-movie,Glenn Kenny,0,"According to a certain interpretation of the auteur theory, a film’s value derives from the extent to which it communicates the personality and character of its director. Judged by that standard alone, I suppose “Hillary’s America” is some kind of masterpiece."
6911,friends-with-benefits-movie,Joe Williams,63,"A bait-and-switch comedy. It poses as a naughty ""no-mance"" about friends who use each other for casual sex, but at the moment of truth it goes limp."
6912,fightclub-movie,Bob Graham,100,Delivers a sucker punch to the audience and then pulls the rug out from under it. It is sensational. It is also grimly funny.
6913,chasing-ice-movie,Mark Jenkins,85,"In Hollywood these days, such epic transformations are rendered with computers and called ""morphing."" Offering a lesson both to filmmakers and climate-change deniers, Chasing Ice demonstrates how much more powerful it is to capture the real thing."
6914,maelstrom-movie,Mark Holcomb,20,"Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically, and borrows heavily from Lynch, Jeunet, and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own."
6915,the-death-of-stalin-movie,Andrew Crump,89,It takes a deft hand and a rare talent to make tyranny and state sanctioned torture so funny.
6916,dead-man-on-campus-movie,Kevin Thomas,10,"Under Alan Cohn's straight-on direction, the film, written by various hands, huffs and puffs mightily just to keep a strenuously labored plot going."
6917,transformers-dark-of-the-moon-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Director Michael Bay, Hollywood's answer to the Antichrist, isn't primarily interested in your soul, though his movie does a pretty effective job of sucking that away (and sucking, in general)."
6918,crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon-movie,Ella Taylor,90,Has the sprawling canvas of an epic and the emotional heat of classical melodrama.
6919,steal-this-movie-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,Misshapen and obfuscating biopic.
6920,showgirls-movie,Elvis Mitchell,0,"The film makers had declared they were bravely exploring new levels of licentiousness, but the biggest risk they've taken here is making a nearly $40 million movie without anyone who can act. The absence of both drama and eroticism turns Showgirls into a bare-butted bore. [22 Sept 1995]"
6921,a-most-violent-year-movie,Alonso Duralde,91,"The pacing, the performances (Albert Brooks is a stand-out as Abel's lawyer), and every facet of the production serves the story and the film's larger ideas."
6922,rollerball-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Bad and baffling from the get-go, probably the only good thing to come out of this Rollerball is the boon it gives the porn industry in terms of another ready-made title to spoof."
6923,the-innkeepers-movie,James Adams,38,"Admittedly, it's been a long time since Kelly McGillis was being hyped as ""the next Grace Kelly."" But of all the films in all the world for whom the former Top Gun lust object could have done a walk-on, this lacklustre haunted-house feature is the one she chooses? "
6924,daddys-home-2-movie,Emily Yoshida,0,"This is a toxic, not at all benign film."
6925,villa-capri-movie,Joe Leydon,10,"Some bad movies trigger swells of anger and outrage, while others prompt industrial-grade snark and scorn. And then there are leaden clunkers like Just Getting Started that provoke an ineffable sense of sadness as one considers how much time, money and talent has been squandered on something so thoroughly useless."
6926,the-cobbler-movie,Brian Tallerico,12,"The Cobbler is almost fascinatingly awful enough to recommend. If one subscribes to the theory that you can learn as much from a bad movie as from a good one, this one’s a master class in what not to do."
6927,the-reagan-show-movie,Fionnuala Halligan,80,"Although this doc is slender, it’s also fascinating, playing into nostalgia and current-day politics in equal measure."
6928,she-hate-me-movie,D. Parvaz,25,What is this movie about? Is it a morality tale? Is it about the complexity of romantic love? Parenthood? Accepting the often-blurred lines of our sexual orientation? Is it about the role of race in white-collar crime? What?
6929,straight-outta-compton-movie,John Semley,88,"Besides the movie’s weight in our contemporary, post-Ferguson historical moment, Straight Outta Compton may also be the funniest, most exhilarating and flat-out best Hollywood movie of the summer."
6930,phantom-2013-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,0,"The dialogue is dreadful (though we are at least spared the usual hokey Russian accents) and the wrap-up ridiculous, the only mystery being why this peculiarity was ever greenlighted at all."
6931,the-shack-movie,Ignatiy Vishnevetsky,25,"There’s nothing about this unconscionably long movie (it runs a whopping 132 minutes) that suggests anyone involved ever watched it from start to finish. But it looks nice enough, like a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, with lots of flowers and flannel."
6932,all-is-lost-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"Redford, already a giant, has never been more suggestive. His character’s misadventure — might be a kind of cosmic penance. It’s the salvation of the moviegoing year."
6933,mother-of-tears-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"Aside from being vile and repellent, it's mainly dull - old-fashioned in its shock tactics and culminating in a ho-hum climax."
6934,miracle-at-st-anna-movie,Ann Hornaday,30,"The movie winds up a casualty of schmaltzy, patronizing sentiment on the one hand and overweening ambition on the other."
6935,magnolia-movie,Lou Lumenick,100,Hands-down the best movie of the year.
6936,full-frontal-movie,Shawn Levy,67,"Feels like a tonic for its makers, a means of clearing the palate after a series of rich meals. For viewers who appreciate risks, it should be just as refreshing."
6937,the-messenger-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,There's nothing drab about the tormented place these men take each other to. You'll want to go along.
6938,blackhat-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,12,Blackhat is also one of the most visually unattractive movies I’ve ever seen. 
6939,unfaithful-movie,Jami Bernard,88,"The movie doesn't stoop to cheap psychoanalysis and must be commended for a bravely ambiguous ending. But most of the credit goes to Lane, who is simply extraordinary as a woman whose body is at war with her conscience."
6940,halloween-the-curse-of-michael-myers-movie,Richard Harrington,10,"And so begins the impale imitation of John Carpenter's once-scary bogyman tale, in which every shadow and reflection is premeditated and all the herrings are red."
6941,red-riding-hood-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,20,This Red Riding Hood loses sight of the forest for the trees on its way to Grandma's house.
6942,the-comedy-movie,A.O. Scott,20,"If you can discern any critical distance or interesting perspective here, or even a good reason to spend 90 minutes in such company, I'm afraid the joke is on you. "
6943,the-assassination-of-richard-nixon-movie,Lawrence Toppman,100,"What surprises us most is the picture's topicality, and not just because terrorists crashed a plane into the Pentagon three years ago."
6944,blame-it-on-rio-movie,Staff (Not Credited),30,"Aside from a good exchange rate of one-liners, the chief feeling left by the movie (a remake of Claude Berri's Un Moment d'Egarement) is of a thin, cynical calculation. Sole reason to catch it would be to monitor one more step of Caine's increasing excellence as middle age overtakes him."
6945,mixed-nuts-movie,James Berardinelli,12,"Mixed Nuts makes a point of stating that there's magic at Christmas. After seeing this movie, I'm a believer. After all, it's virtually impossible to come up with an alternate explanation of how something this awful could make it to theaters across the nation."
6946,hudson-hawk-movie,Joe Brown,10,"Merely airheaded where it should be lighthearted, Hudson Hawk offers a klutzy, charmless hero, and wallows dully in limp slapstick and lowest common denominator crudeness."
6947,always-movie,Jay Scott,38,"To report that Always will make you cry is not esthetically saying much; slicing up onions has the same effect. Leslie Halliwell's one-word summation of the forties version applies to Spielberg's update for the nineties: ""icky."" [26 Dec. 1989]"
6948,the-do-over-movie,Keith Uhlich,0,"By now, it's clear that every Adam Sandler movie is dada of the high-concept, low-hanging-fruit variety, in which the Happy Madison stock company uses filmmaking (loosely termed) as an excuse to take an extended tropical vacation."
6949,doctor-strange-movie,Barry Hertz,38,"If that wasn’t enough, there is something even more dispiriting about Doctor Strange beyond its halfhearted visual and narrative ambitions – an issue that made a brief blip on the cultural radar when the film was first announced but has distressingly gone unheard of since: This is a movie that revels in whitewashing."
6950,crazy-stupid-love-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Men will watch Crazy, Stupid, Love thinking they're finding out things about women, but if anything, this movie works the other way. Women will get a glimpse into the male mind."
6951,hellraiser-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"This is a movie without wit, style or reason, and the true horror is that actors were made to portray, and technicians to realize, its bankruptcy of imagination. "
6952,good-burger-movie,Matthew Gilbert,38,"It's a neighborhood comedy for kids that squanders the high energy of a group of young actors on a stubbornly unimaginative script. [25 July 1997, p.C5]"
6953,wonder-woman-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"Caught up in the coils of Princess Diana’s hot lasso, I am bound to tell the truth: Wonder Woman is wonderful, and the Woman herself, as played by Gal Gadot, is the dazzling embodiment of female empowerment. She is also learned, charmingly funny and, for a goddess, touchingly human."
6954,grosse-pointe-blank-movie,Sean Means,80,"Armitage, Cusack and his Evanston chums have their work cut out for them to turn a stone killer into a sympathetic romantic character. That they succeed in such a shrewdly funny way is downright amazing."
6955,the-sons-room-movie,Chris Fujiwara,75,A triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos.
6956,legends-of-oz-dorothys-return-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,"All the brains, heart and courage in the world can't save a movie that doesn't have a third act."
6957,the-addams-family-movie,Jay Carr,38,"Ultimately, the film's self-censoring will to sweetness and innocence is even more fatal than the flimsiness of the plot. [22 Nov 1991, p.33]"
6958,the-gift-movie,Curt Fields,30,So chock-full of stereotypes as to be a filmic Southern Country Safari.
6959,good-night-and-good-luck-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,None-too-subtly implies Murrow could easily be talking about the present day.
6960,starred-up-movie,Brian Tallerico,88,Starred Up is HEAVY with slang and accents. You won’t understand a third of it. But there’s so much going on in between the lines of dialogue that you won’t care. 
6961,the-dukes-movie,Stephen Holden,20,"Plods along in its sloppy, joshing way, it tastes like pasta sauce that has sat on the shelf long after the expiration date on the can."
6962,freddy-got-fingered-movie,John Patterson,10,Lurches from one set-piece stomach-lurcher to the next with nary a nod to narrative coherence.
6963,hes-just-not-that-into-you-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,30,Boring at best and insidious at worst.
6964,blue-jasmine-movie,Manohla Dargis,100,"[Allen's] most sustained, satisfying and resonant film since “Match Point.”"
6965,a-hologram-for-the-king-movie,Michael Nordine,64,"A Hologram for the King succeeds at putting us in Alan’s meandering headspace, but that doesn’t mean you’ll find his journey as meaningful as he does."
6966,the-elephant-man-movie,Kim Newman,80,"If you thought the sweetness of The Straight Story was unprecedented in Lynchs work, look again at this earlier true-life tale of odd, everyday heroism."
6967,superfly-movie,Mike Scott,20,"The new Superfly is, simply, a terrible movie. It is slick, and it boasts action, hot tunes and style to spare. But beyond the polish that a deep-pocketed studio backer can buy -- in this case, Sony's Columbia Pictures shingle -- this is a shamefully hollow movie that fails on multiple levels."
6968,the-grand-budapest-hotel-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"It's a mature, intricately layered visual delight."
6969,may-movie,Tim Merrill,80,"Call it a horror movie, a psychological thriller or a feminist splatterfest, but this sort of story is tough to get right. May gets it more than right."
6970,fools-gold-movie,Wesley Morris,25,A tedious adventure-romance.
6971,horrible-bosses-2-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"What Horrible Bosses 2 lacks in nasty repartee, it tries to make up for in poorly staged comedy chases and break-ins. It is the Hollywood equivalent of a rambunctious little boy pointing to the toilet and squealing, “Mommy, look what I made!”"
6972,the-rocketeer-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"The Rocketeer may not be perfect, but it's an excellent example of how to adapt a comic book to the screen."
6973,miss-bala-movie,Eric Kohn,91,"In each tense moment, Miss Bala has a lot to say in a few words."
6974,mile-22-movie,Bobby LePire,10,"This isn’t a movie, it is anti-cinema; an endurance test to discover how malleable a human’s brain is."
6975,we-are-your-friends-movie,Brian Truitt,38,A plethora of beats drop but little else of note — musical or otherwise — happens in the Zac Efron DJ fest We Are Your Friends.
6976,true-grit-movie,Angie Errigo,100,"Terrific: tough, exciting, funny, gorgeous and bewitchingly acted, this is darn close to perfection."
6977,basic-instinct-movie,Dave Kehr,25,"Verhoeven does not explore the dark side, but merely exploits it, and that makes all the difference in the world."
6978,the-hangover-part-ii-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"It's a dumb, ugly and, most of all, painfully unfunny movie."
6979,cop-out-movie,Rex Reed,0,"With so much junk littering the screen these days, the movie business looks like a garbage strike, and it’s beginning to smell, too. The latest pollution from the celluloid dumpster is sub-mental horror called Cop Out."
6980,the-layover-movie,Kimber Myers,10,Second-tier airline safety videos are more entertaining than this fourth-rate comedy. Flight attendants on Southwest’s less-traveled routes are far funnier than the cast here. Watching a lonely suitcase circle a baggage claim conveyor belt is more diverting.
6981,the-life-of-david-gale-movie,Roger Ebert,0,"The secrets of the plot must remain unrevealed by me, so that you can be offended by them yourself, but let it be said this movie is about as corrupt, intellectually bankrupt and morally dishonest as it could possibly be without David Gale actually hiring himself out as a joker at the court of Saddam Hussein. "
6982,in-my-country-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"In their desire to humanize the big story, director John Boorman and screenwriter Ann Peacock ... have resorted to groan-inducing cliches and clunky narrative."
6983,evil-dead-2013-movie,Stephen Whitty,75,Be warned that this is a movie literally awash in blood and graphic violence. 
6984,flirt-movie,Tim Appelo,25,Flirt fails because the basic story isn't very good and its retelling adds only incidental insights. [11 Oct 1996]
6985,9-songs-movie,David Edelstein,30,"9 Songs could have been ""Last Rock Show in London."" Unfortunately, it's stupefyingly dull, even with good music and at the short but resonant length of 69 minutes."
6986,north-country-movie,Owen Gleiberman,75,"Might have been richer, tougher, more honestly liberal if it had revealed a few more shades of gray among the men."
6987,the-patriot-movie,Michael Wilmington,63,"As a whole, though, the movie is much less magnetic or believable than its star."
6988,love-mercy-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"In telling the story of one damaged suburban genius and his unlikely rebirth, Love & Mercy captures the vanished possibilities of 1960s pop music, the fecklessness of the California dream and its decay into tragedy and madness, and other things less easy to describe or define."
6989,furry-vengeance-movie,Lisa Rosman,20,The only saving grace of this wannabe Looney Tune? The animals don’t talk.
6990,the-natural-movie,Bill Cosford,75,"The Natural is dense with Boys' Life stories and grand heroics, and it sometimes wanders from black comedy to serious icon-bashing and back again. But mostly it's good fun. At the end, everyone in the audience is swinging imaginary bats. It's a great movie for summer. [11 May 1984, p.D1]"
6991,this-is-it-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"One of the best documents of live performance that I've ever seen, a rehearsal diary that's more intimate and immediate than a traditional concert film."
6992,the-royal-tenenbaums-movie,J. Hoberman,90,"May not be the movie of the year, but it is a seasonal gift to us all. Sweet and funny, doggedly oddball if bordering precious."
6993,gi-joe-the-rise-of-cobra-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Formerly a real American hero, G.I. Joe is no longer a hero (it's a group) or American. (It's a multinational team of military superstars, though the way it does business, you'd feel safer with the Croatian navy on your side.)"
6994,layer-cake-movie,Nathan Rabin,70,"The always-dependable and chameleon-like Craig has the chops and substance for that kind of film, but Vaughn prefers to keep matters brisk and superficial."
6995,friend-request-movie,A.A. Dowd ,25,"There’s nothing remotely clever about this web-based fright flick, visually or conceptually. It’s flimsy genre junk of the most generic variety, just with a really groan-worthy Facebook spin."
6996,the-boy-next-door-movie,Ed Gonzalez,12,The camera regards Guzman's buttocks and Lopez's breasts with an evasion of visual pleasure that could be blamed on the actors' nudity clauses if the entirety of the film didn't resemble a Lifetime movie embarrassed to have found its way to theaters.
6997,dont-say-a-word-movie,Kim Morgan,25,"Maybe if the story weren't so ludicrous we'd care. Or maybe if the film just went overboard with its ludicrousness, we'd be entertained, but Don't Say a Word is merely boring."
6998,walle-movie,Liam Lacey,100,"Mixing Chaplinesque delicacy with the architectural grandeur of a Stanley Kubrick film, director Andrew Stanton recycles film history and makes something fresh and accessible from it without pandering to a young audience."
6999,daddys-home-2-movie,Barry Hertz,0,"It should not exist, and the fact that it does is a slap in the face of anyone suckered into buying a ticket."
7000,gloomy-sunday-movie,Marrit Ingman,78,"Moments of black comedy break up the melodrama – a newsreel depicts the song's ""victims"" and a Nazi secretary rages against her Duden grammar manual – but the overall tone is still that of a four-alarm weeper."
7001,deceptive-practices-the-mysteries-and-mentors-of-ricky-jay-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,90,Here's a movie with magic.
7002,hounddog-movie,Peter Travers,12,"What I can't figure is why anyone would want to release this tripe in theaters just when Fanning has nearly lived it down. They ain't no friends of mine, or any other moviegoer."
7003,a-beautiful-mind-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,Crowe sometimes summons up one of the most powerful depictions of mental illness I have ever seen with barely an eyelid flicker separating manifestations of sickness from utterly sane displays of creative concentration.
7004,the-thing-1982-movie,Tom Huddleston,100,"The Thing has emerged as one of our most potent modern terrors, combining the icy-cold chill of suspicion and uncertainty with those magnificently imaginative effects blowouts."
7005,killer-of-sheep-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"Having heard tell of its wonders for decades, I found the actual movie less transporting than I'd been led to expect. It's clearly a brilliant debut."
7006,uhf-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"In UHF we get 90 minutes of Al Yankovic, and that's 85 minutes too much. The problem isn't that he's weird, but that he isn't weird at all. The premises for his gags are commonplace and predictable, and his follow-throughs lack imagination. He seems incapable of spinning more than one tired joke from each set-up. [21 Jul 1989, p.E1]"
7007,lamour-fou-movie,Betsy Sharkey,70,The documentary is fascinating as a museum piece with Berge serving as docent. 
7008,all-about-the-benjamins-movie,Dana Stevens,30,"This movie, a chaotic caper film at heart, wrecks its comic tone with some moments of gruesome violence."
7009,frank-movie,Kenneth Turan,80,"Odd, offbeat, somehow endearing, the bleakly comic Frank has its own kind of charm as well as some pointed, poignant things to say about the mysterious nature of creativity, where it comes from and where it might all go."
7010,battle-royale-2000-movie,Maggie Lee,70,"Bloodhounds will lick their lips experiencing the re-launch of Kinji Fukasaku's trendsetting Battle Royale (2000) with 3D effects, which basically make the splatter scenes gorier and stickier."
7011,beastly-movie,Steven Rea,38,"Beastly offers a thoroughly dopey reread of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" fairy tale."
7012,the-last-station-movie,Marc Mohan,75,"Giamatti, in fact, makes off with a few scenes as the literally mustache-twirling antagonist, providing some welcome moments of over-the-top levity."
7013,the-brave-one-movie,Claudia Puig,63,"If only The Brave One had captured more of the complex nature of the fear and paranoia plaguing society since 9/11. Instead, it is a well-made but predictable take on the revenge fantasy thriller, with a female twist."
7014,corky-romano-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"It might be courting hyperbole to call Corky Romano the single worst movie ever to feature an ''SNL'' cast member (Dan Aykroyd hit some pretty arid valleys), but I'm willing to go out on a critical limb and rank it among the all-time bottom dozen."
7015,home-again-movie,Roger Moore,38,"It’s the dullest movie about Tinseltown in decades, an irritating film full of irritating turns. "
7016,under-the-tree-movie,Kyle Kohner,83,"With suburban normalcy ultimately derailed by a suitably cynical, albeit humorous resolution, the final actions these neighbors take contribute to a far more meaningful message regarding the unsympathetic tendencies of humanity. Moreover, the measures taken by these feuding characters underlie the ruinous ways in which grief, hysteria and mental illness as a whole continue to be approached by society, especially by our own family members and neighbors."
7017,one-thousand-ae-movie,Scott Foundas,30,"Shyamalan is clearly a director-for-hire here, his disinterest palpable from first frame to last. Nowhere in evidence is the gifted ""Sixth Sense"" director who once brought intricately crafted setpieces and cinematic sleight-of-hand to even the least of his own movies."
7018,the-low-down-movie,Dennis Lim,70,"Captures the latent anxieties of a hazy, ambling existence with pinpoint accuracy."
7019,bridge-to-terabithia-movie,Alex Chun,90,"A wonderfully heart-wrenching love story for tweens, teens, and even adults who fondly remember when a friendship could be ignited by a gesture as simple as offering a stick of Juicy Fruit."
7020,the-machinist-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"In the hands of a less talented filmmaker, The Machinist would have felt like a stunt. But Anderson, with a terrific assist from Bale, makes his character's plight achingly physical."
7021,atonement-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"Nothing comes easily in Atonement, especially its ending, which, both happy and tragic, is as wrenching as it is genuinely satisfying. How fitting, somehow, that a novel so devoted to the precision and passionate love of language be captured in a film that is simply too exquisite for words."
7022,white-noise-movie,Wesley Morris,12,A moronic exercise in supernatural claptrap.
7023,luminarias-movie,Wesley Morris,0,"It is a traffic jam of broken hearts, fluxing racial identities and deplorable outfits that has everything but a salsa overhaul of ""I Will Survive."""
7024,john-wick-movie,Christy Lemire,75,"John Wick breathes exhilarating life into this tired premise, thanks to some dazzling action choreography, stylish visuals and–most importantly–a vintage anti-hero performance from Keanu Reeves. "
7025,the-imitation-game-movie,Steve Persall,91,"Cumberbatch radiates such intelligence — with Sherlock and this, egghead Benedict is his speciality — that gaps are easily excused. From sets and costumes to Alexandre Desplat's musical score, The Imitation Game is everything classy that Hollywood wishes it could be."
7026,winchester-movie,Stephen Dalton,30,"Mirren always brings a touch of class, of course, even to deluxe schlock like this. But Clarke is something of a blank leading man while the secondary characters are mostly pale phantoms sleepwalking through a thinly drawn plot."
7027,cry-the-beloved-country-movie,James Berardinelli,100,"There is not a false note in Cry, the Beloved Country. Every scene is an example of near-perfect composition and execution."
7028,welcome-to-the-rileys-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,A flawed script prevents Welcome to the Rileys from being the effective meditation on grief and healing it wants to be.
7029,elf-movie,Dana Stevens,70,"A charming, silly family Christmas movie more likely to spread real joy than migraine, indigestion and sugar shock. The movie succeeds because it at once restrains its sticky, gooey good cheer and wildly overdoes it."
7030,wing-commander-space-will-never-be-the-same-movie,Anita Gates ,10,The film is painfully boring and funny in the wrong places.
7031,under-the-skin-movie,Roger Moore,75,"Under the Skin isn’t conventional, thrilling or particularly satisfying in a sci-fi aliens-are-hunting-us sense. But it manages something far more sinister and fascinating. It gets under your skin and imprints on your memory."
7032,robocop-3-movie,Desson Thomson,37,"The movie, which is deadly slow and full of Japanese-bashing, is also an undisguised merchandising promo. "
7033,spring-breakers-movie,Simon Crook,80,"A lurid, luminous teen-bender movie, as ludicrous as it is stylish, and Harmony Korine’s best film in years. "
7034,winters-tale-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"For those who haven’t read the Mark Helprin novel on which Akiva Goldsman’s film is based, prepare to be confused, annoyed, bewildered, and yet more annoyed by the director’s inability to construct even the most basic of narrative fantasy romances."
7035,two-can-play-that-game-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,30,Too bad very few of these high jinks are actually funny -- the outtakes at the end of the film suggest a more relaxed ensemble vibe that the film proper was unable to retain.
7036,a-serious-man-movie,Dana Stevens,100,"A Serious Man is an exquisitely realized work; the filmmakers' technical mastery of their craft, always impressive, has become absolute. The script reads like a novel, densely allusive, funny, and terse."
7037,bad-moms-christmas-movie,Richard Roeper,38,It’s sloppy to the point of distraction — not that the forced hijinks and ridiculous storylines are actually worthy of our attention.
7038,you-the-living-movie,Peter Bradshaw,80,"You, the Living is a very funny film - though in the darkest possible way. It is a silent comedy, but with words."
7039,blind-spot-hitlers-secretary-movie,David Sterritt,100,"Junge's testimony is a salutary reminder that Hitler was like other people in ways, and that the evil he manifested could visit us again if more civilized humans don't remain watchful."
7040,i-melt-with-you-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"When a sheriff's deputy (Carla Gugino) visits the house, I Melt With You turns into a ludicrous, cheap horror thriller that sheds any claims to integrity. By the end, you feel nothing, not even contempt. "
7041,boo!-a-madea-halloween-movie,John Fink,25,"Ultimately, Boo! A Madea Holloween is a comedy with few too laughs, a stilted made-for-TV look, and weak character development."
7042,valentine-movie,Marc Savlov,0,Valentine succeeds only in boring you to death.
7043,flashdance-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"If Flashdance had spent just a little more effort getting to know the heroine of its story, and a little less time trying to rip off ""Saturday Night Fever,"" it might have been a much better film."
7044,blackkklansman-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"This freewheeling account of an African-American cop who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1970s is problematic as narrative drama, but stunning as provocation."
7045,damsels-in-distress-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"Stillman writes his own dialogue, and is a master of clever double-reverse wit."
7046,bringing-out-the-dead-movie,Tom Keogh,90,Certainly one of his (Scorsese's) most profound works.
7047,reindeer-games-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"The first All Talking Killer picture. After the setup, it consists mostly of characters explaining their actions to one another."
7048,the-master-of-disguise-movie,Dan Fienberg,10,The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe.
7049,che-part-two-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"Che is Soderbergh's most interesting film in years, defiantly eccentric and absorbing at its best."
7050,the-kite-runner-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Like ""House of Sand and Fog"" and ""Man Push Cart,"" it helps us to understand that the newcomers among us come from somewhere and are somebody."
7051,red-lights-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"The slowness of the film's first half will be off-putting to many, but the film's turns and final twist will reward the patient."
7052,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"If filmmaking has ever been less thrilling and more disengaging, I'd like to see it."
7053,a-serious-man-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,See this film immediately.
7054,silent-hill-movie,Peter Hartlaub,0,"Silent Hill has plenty of bad acting, bad dialogue and a confusing plot -- all of which become exponentially more painful when the movie goes on forever."
7055,pootie-tang-movie,Todd McCarthy,10,Has the distinction of being one of the most amateurish features ever released by a major studio.
7056,the-roommate-movie,Elvis Mitchell,5,"The Roommate has notched an unbelievable achievement; it makes the second rate ""One Tree Hill"" seems like it was about something. "
7057,the-worlds-end-movie,Matt Maytum,80,"The armageddon-through-beer-goggles approach brings the chuckles, but The World’s End stands up as a great example of the genre it ribs. Nostalgic, bittersweet and very, very funny."
7058,angel-heart-movie,Rick Groen,75,"There's a Faustian bargain in Angel Heart, and not only on the screen. Undeniably, Parker is hobnobbing with the false gods of Style. But isn't it just the damnest thing: he's having (and giving) a hell of a good time. [07 Mar 1987]"
7059,the-white-ribbon-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,Haneke (Caché) has created a morality tale that concludes with the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand: one more example of a solitary act of violence that unleashes a cataclysm.
7060,carrie-pilby-movie,Diego Semerene,0,The film is essentially an exercise in forcing a female genius back into her proper place of dependence on both the father figure and the Prince Charming.
7061,red-eye-movie,William Arnold,83,"With so much going for it, it's sad that Red Eye goes into such a third-act tailspin and cliched slasher-flick finale."
7062,tower-heist-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,70,"You can't help leaving the film with the following thought: Man, it's good to see Murphy being funny again."
7063,cameraperson-movie,Justin Chang,100,"In ways both subtle and overt, the movie continually draws our attention to the human consciousness guiding every shot, the hand that is gently yet unmistakably manipulating the image."
7064,highlander-endgame-movie,J. Rentilly,0,"Endgame has become a nincompoop's travelogue, drenched in stage blood, fake beards, and crappy special effects."
7065,the-hot-spot-movie,Dave Kehr,75,"Pretty silly. The Hot Spot certainly is, and it's occasionally quite entertaining for it, though the picture never really achieves a dimension beyond that of a Playboy Party Joke. [26 Oct 1990, Friday, p.I]"
7066,in-the-name-of-my-daughter-movie,Lawrence Toppman,67,"When the movie shifts gears, coming forward almost 30 years, Maurice becomes less interesting – and so does the picture."
7067,hot-tub-time-machine-2-movie,Bilge Ebiri,10,"It tries to repeat everything the original did, and winds up leaving you stone-faced and depressed. I think there were more laughs in Schindler’s List."
7068,behaving-badly-movie,Stephen Dalton,30,"A clumsy high-school sex comedy which tries too hard to be both shocking and endearing, falling short on both counts."
7069,punisher-war-zone-movie,Staff (Not credited),38,"A disappointingly schlocky effort that gives up on trying to make a realistic Punisher movie, settling instead on a hokey, multi-colored-neon gun rave best enjoyed in Rob Zombie's family room."
7070,my-father-the-hero-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,0,A hateful ”family” comedy based on jokey insinuations of incest.
7071,autumn-lights-movie,Brian Welk,70,"Autumn Lights examines love while embracing that philosophy of melancholia, and it manages to do so without plunging into tragedy or melodrama. Like the remote region of Iceland where it’s set, the film offers a quiet, thoughtful escape."
7072,before-we-vanish-movie,Rory O'Connor,83,"Anytime it feels that Before We Vanish is getting too caught up in its thought process, the director is always ready with a flash of ultra violence, slapstick humor, or a pithy line."
7073,the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"For now, The Two Towers feels like the second installment in what next year, when Frodo finally reaches Mount Doom and the story draws to a close, we'll surely be hailing as a masterpiece."
7074,united-93-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,70,"To see the flight captain and co-pilot checking the plane before takeoff, to watch the varied passengers settling into their seats, is more agonizing than watching passengers board the ship in all those ""Titanic"" films. With United 93 we see these people unknowingly stepping into a history that is still in terrible process. But as a work in (let's call it) the Akhmatova mode, it does not and could not succeed."
7075,the-party-movie,Peter Travers,75,"The laughs hurt so good, and the guests at this shindig treat each other like dartboards for 71 minutes. Yes, that's short for a movie, but your nerves couldn’t take more."
7076,kicking-screaming-movie,Robert K. Elder,63,"It's Ferrell who is the vehicle, a mow-you-down comic engine, and everyone else is just along for the ride in this marginally effective, starkly unoriginal family comedy."
7077,circuit-movie,Dennis Lim,10,"Even from deep in a K-hole, you'd need about 10 seconds to figure out the remaining plot twists in this jaded muscle-queen morality tale."
7078,whipped-movie,J. Rentilly,0,Its film school aesthetics and sophomoric storytelling are sense-deadening.
7079,in-praise-of-love-movie,Jonathan Curiel,75,A film that has unusual expectations from its audience -- and that's a welcome relief.
7080,the-cat-in-the-hat-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"Critics are paid to suffer bad art,no matter how icky it is from the start. So all we could do was to Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!  And we did not like it.  Not one little bit."
7081,adam-steve-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,"Often charming and funny, though sometimes quite gross."
7082,devils-due-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"As with most found footage films, there’s a lot of tediousness, with the early proceedings resembling the sort of home movies from which anyone not directly involved would normally flee."
7083,away-we-go-movie,David Denby,80,"Some of the episodes are ripely satirical, others almost heartbreaking. Allison Janney appears as a coarse drunk who taunts her kids; Maggie Gyllenhaal is a pushy New Age mom whose aggressive virtue saps the strength of everyone around her."
7084,war-machine-movie,Robbie Collin,20,A fantastically dreary and flatulent anti-war satire.
7085,the-rainmaker-movie,Todd McCarthy,90,"As carefully constructed, handsomely crafted and flavorsomely acted as a top-of-the-line production from Hollywood's classical studio era, Francis Ford Coppola's screen version of John Grisham's The Rainmaker would seem to represent just about all a filmmaker could do with the best-selling author's patented dramatic formulas without subverting them altogether."
7086,pixels-movie,Marc Mohan,8,"There are legitimate excuses for going to see Pixels. Losing a bet, perhaps. Having a loved one held for ransom. Maybe a serious blow to the head. But none of those (except maybe the last) would allow you watch and actually enjoy the latest cinematic leavings of Adam Sandler."
7087,introducing-the-dwights-movie,Aaron Hillis,30,"With its broad, toothless humor and ham-fisted fits of melodrama, this sitcom-grade embarrassment aims to dethrone ""Muriel's Wedding"" as the quirky Aussie feel-gooder of all time, except it hurts too much to watch."
7088,quick-change-movie,Rick Groen,100,"Delightfully inventive, consistently funny, clever but not slick, brisk yet never antic, Quick Change is the perfect cinematic date - a summer film for all seasons, the kind of sharp-edged picture that gives lightweight a good name. [14 Jul 1990, p.C3]"
7089,ready-to-rumble-movie,Sean Means,0,"I just wanted to rail against the casual homophobia, the senseless violence and the sociopathic cruelty that Ready to Rumble treats as good clean fun."
7090,scooby-doo-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,10,The gratuitous vulgarity is just one more reason that Scooby-Doo should never have left the pound.
7091,romance-movie,Jean Oppenheimer,30,The fact that Romance was written and directed by a woman doesn't make the film any better; it simply makes it objectionable on other grounds.
7092,duck-season-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"Duck Season is something quite different, capable of gratifying film snobs and regular viewers alike."
7093,wakefield-movie,Tim Grierson,70,"Although Wakefield’s ending leaves open the possibility for multiple interpretations, the filmmaker removes the sting from her story’s tale, which keeps its insights from cutting as deep."
7094,mccanick-movie,Nikola Grozdanovic,16,"It fails to convince, and succeeds only in frustrating."
7095,brothers-movie,David Edelstein,90,Sheridan’s actors work with their intellects fully engaged--and they engage us on levels we barely knew we had.
7096,brooklyn-movie,A.O. Scott,90,"Brooklyn endows its characters with desires and aspirations, but not with foresight, and it examines the past with open-minded curiosity rather than with sentimentality or easy judgment."
7097,gimme-shelter-2014-movie,Peter Travers,38,Propaganda is a bitch to act. And this misguided movie leaves Hudgens buried in it.
7098,simpatico-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,10,An extravagant waste of resources.
7099,the-ladykillers-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"The new version of The Ladykillers is like an able forger's copy of a masterpiece. The brushstrokes are broader, the colors are a little less subtle, and one or two portions of the canvas were finished in a hurry. But it's well worth a look if you're passing by. "

7102,jiro-dreams-of-sushi-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"We meet a variety of interdependent characters, from tuna vendors to rice experts, all in thrall to Jiro and his sons. I really wish Tokyo were closer."
7103,man-on-the-moon-movie,Kevin Maynard,63,"Unsuccessfully attempts to fathom Kaufman's lunatic sensibilities, supplying scant psychological insight into what made the outrageous comic tick."
7104,high-school-musical-3-senior-year-movie,Perry Seibert,75,"It's a well-produced yearbook that will one day bring back sweet memories for the cast and fans, but probably won't be of interest to anyone who wasn't part of the scene."
7105,get-smart-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"Rather than the laugh a minute promised by old comedies, Get Smart generates approximately one laugh per hour, and I can't remember either one."
7106,the-people-vs-larry-flynt-movie,Robert Horton,100,"Forman imbues the material with exactly the right dry, satirical flavor, yet this story is still a Frank Capra little-guy-against-the-system picture."
7107,the-passion-of-the-christ-movie,David Edelstein,20,This is a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie -- The Jesus Chainsaw Massacre -- that thinks it's an act of faith. 
7108,head-over-heels-movie,Kimberley Jones,30,"Head Over Heels whitewashes the originality and, well, weirdness Waters showed in his first film, although it's impossibe to imagine anything starring young poster-pups Potter and Prinze Jr. could be particularly edgy."
7109,hollywood-shuffle-movie,Christine Arnold,75,"Hollywood Shuffle isn't perfect. It usually looks as cheap as it was, and some of the messages land with a thud instead of a zing. But its central point -- hold onto your dream and your dignity -- is inspiring. A promising filmmaker has been born. [12 June 1987, p.D-5]"
7110,rock-of-ages-movie,Ann Hornaday,38,"Rock of Ages gets too mired in plotty cul de sacs, manufactured setbacks and numbers that are all staged as show-stoppers. In the words of the Journey song that serves as a climactic singalong, it goes on and on and on and on."
7111,jim-andy-the-great-beyond-featuring-a-very-special-contractually-obligated-mention-of-tony-clifton-movie,Manohla Dargis,100,"The result isn’t another ho-hum documentary likeness in which all the elements neatly and often flatteringly stack up. “Jim & Andy” is instead a complexly layered and textured Cubist portrait, one that’s been constructed from fragments of its two title subjects and their work."
7112,the-pink-panther-2-movie,Mary Elizabeth Williams,10,One of the most dreadfully unnecessary movies in recent memory.
7113,besotted-movie,Megan Lehmann,12,"Contains much more prosaic ingredients. Like props and sound effects that could have been borrowed from an off-off-Broadway play, a host of painfully strained performances and a plot that's almost unbearably stupid."
7114,the-imposter-movie,Rick Groen,75,"The utterly bizarre story made national news when it broke, has since provided much magazine fodder, and popped up only two years ago adapted into a dramatic feature. Now it receives the documentary treatment and, in the devilishly manipulative hands of director Bart Layton, what a treatment it is – the weirdness just gets weirder."
7115,joe-dirt-movie,Desson Thomson,10,All failed concept and misfired comedy.
7116,coming-through-the-rye-movie,Sheri Linden,70,"Sadwith, whose TV credits include the miniseries “Sinatra,” conjures a few memorable moments in his big-screen debut. But the most stirring moment belongs to Cooper, who turns a barely audible, exasperated sigh into a complicated life story."
7117,life-or-something-like-it-movie,Mike Clark,38,Life is a crock -- or something like it.
7118,insidious-chapter-3-movie,Michael Ordona,0,"Insidious: Chapter 3 is simply not scary. Not a bit, not a whit. Except that the audience will be terrified of the next stabbing of their eardrums, at generally predictable intervals."
7119,the-fault-in-our-stars-movie,Diane Garrett,90,"The Fault in Our Stars may not show the true messiness of cancer, but it does grapple with death and the ability to survive great loss. Maybe that's enough truth for one movie."
7120,the-big-short-movie,Calvin Wilson,100,The Big Short is the film that “The Wolf of Wall Street” wanted to be.
7121,the-gallows-movie,Josh Kupecki,0,The Gallows offers exactly none of the frisson or pleasure of a found-footage film done right.
7122,identity-thief-movie,Peter Rainer,0,"I squirmed in my seat throughout Identity Thief, a colossally unfunny and misguided comedy. "
7123,frozen-river-movie,Roger Ebert,100,Sometimes two performances come along that are so perfectly matched that no overt signals are needed to show how the characters feel about each other. That's what happens between Melissa Leo and Misty Upham in Frozen River.
7124,the-man-who-wasnt-there-movie,Peter Travers,90,"Steadily engrossing and devilishly funny, and, o brother, does it look sharp."
7125,gleason-movie,Sheri Linden,90,"If this film portrait stirs deep emotions, they spring from a breathtakingly unsentimental embrace of life at its most challenging."
7126,the-identical-movie,Chuck Bowen,0,"The film's so preoccupied with being ""inspirational"" that it disastrously fails to evoke the allure of rock n' roll, particularly in America in the 1950s, when it represented an erosion of racial and sexual barriers."
7127,john-wick-chapter-2-movie,Justin Chang,90,"The movie may look like disposable goods — it’s a sequel, a shoot-’em-up, starring an actor too often treated as a punchline — but it is also a connoisseur’s delight, a down-and-dirty B-picture with a lustrous A-picture soul."
7128,lauberge-espagnole-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"A lighthearted, good-natured motion picture that contains enough humor to leaven the tone and keep the drama from becoming too serious."
7129,the-sitter-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"It's smart, funny, agreeably perverse and simultaneously abrupt and exhausting."
7130,natural-selection-movie,Mark Feeney,25,"The movie has elements of road picture, social satire, and odd-couple romance, but mostly it's about lack of pacing and tone. Somewhere very (very) deep in here is a whiff of ""Citizen Ruth,"" and who knows what Alexander Payne might have done with this material. Instead we know what writer-director Robbie Pickering has done with it, and that ain't much."
7131,paranormal-activity-3-movie,Roger Ebert,25,"Inexplicably, there are people who still haven't had enough of these movies. The first was a nifty novelty. Now the appeal has worn threadbare."
7132,when-in-rome-movie,Janice Page,25,"It winds up being predictably charmless and forgettable, even as a travelogue or iPod download."
7133,one-for-the-money-movie,A.O. Scott,30,"An attempt to inaugurate a new movie franchise, something that might appeal to women and mystery fans. This is a perfectly sound ambition, but the movie, directed by Julie Anne Robinson from a script by Stacy Sherman, Karen Ray and Liz Brixius, is so weary and uninspired that it feels more like an exhausted end than an energetic beginning. "
7134,thomas-in-love-movie,Paula Nechak,25,"Since we never see Thomas, we can't care for him. And he's hardly a sympathetic ""hero"" in his treatment of women and his insistence that other characters honor his personal boundaries while he ignores theirs."
7135,murder-on-the-orient-express-1974-movie,Andrew Sarris,10,Murder on the Orient Express falls down so badly as escapist entertainment that it is as if it were designed to prove the proposition that movies and mysteries don't mix.
7136,once-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,80,"Although there's plenty of music, and plenty of joy, in Once, it's ultimately a quiet, wistful picture."
7137,scrooged-movie,Staff (Not Credited),10,"Scrooged is an appallingly unfunny comedy, and a vivid illustration of the fact that money can't buy you laughs. Its stocking spilling with big names and production values galore, this updating of Dickens' A Christmas Carol into the world of cutthroat network television is, one episode apart, able to generate only a few mild chuckles."
7138,hoot-movie,M. E. Russell,25,"It's meant to be funny, but I couldn't help thinking they were figuring out where to plant the pipe bombs."
7139,jason-x-movie,Hank Sartin,10,"Here suspense is abandoned, and Jason is on-screen so long you get sick of seeing him -- and sick of the poorly staged slasher-film tricks."
7140,the-fantasticks-movie,Dana Stevens,20,"The movie version overflows with affection and good intention, but unwittingly turns a bauble of cheerful fakery into something that mostly feels phony."
7141,war-inc-movie,Claudia Puig,63,"Screwball, vaguely futuristic political satires are a rare hybrid, and War, Inc. is an intriguing, if flawed, example."
7142,needful-things-movie,Mike Clark,25,"Even by King-movie standards (and there are none lower), the misanthropy, grotesque humor, and all-out ugliness is itself in maximum overdrive. [27 Aug 1993, p.3D]"
7143,paris-can-wait-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,30,"By the time the final meal is devoured, you’ll be wanting nothing so much as an antacid."
7144,little-men-movie,Matthew Anderson,100,Sachs' extraordinarily humane knack for emotional restraint echoes throughout Little Men. And it is all the more profound for it. 
7145,the-next-three-days-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,A ponderous but mesmerizing tick-tock thriller.
7146,the-snowman-movie,Barry Hertz,25,"An awkward, needlessly dark, atrocious mess whose visual tics courtesy of director Tomas Alfredson amount to, basically, snow. So. Much. Snow. Shockingly, a fetish for the white stuff in no way overcomes any clunky narrative obstacles here – and they are legion."
7147,robot-and-frank-movie,Steve Persall,91,"Robot & Frank occasionally strains for emotion and stretches credulity, even for such fantasy circumstances. But it has two hearts - one human, one not - in the right place, and intelligence that is anything but artificial."
7148,jennifers-body-movie,Nick Antosca,80,"The difference between “Juno” and Jennifer’s Body, I realized, was that Diablo Cody's disgustingly smug dialogue -- supposedly so winning when spoken by Juno -- is much easier to swallow when it comes from characters who actually are disgustingly smug -- like Jennifer."
7149,tabloid-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,88,"McKinney, a woman whose spellbinding and baffling presence - nay, performance - in Tabloid more than lives up to her recent off-screen antics."
7150,teeth-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"A clever and affecting thriller/comedy about a subject that absolutely cannot be written about in a daily newspaper or website that's for a general audience. The film is a giddy pastiche of styles -- slasher picture, faith film, social satire, teen romp, '50s atom bomb monster movie -- and it makes you laugh and squirm and grin in appreciation."
7151,national-treasure-movie,Peter Travers,25,"It's not just hard to believe any of this, it's impossible. And director Jon Turteltaub (Phenomenom) directs with robotic cheerlessness. "
7152,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,Jack Mathews,0,"One of the darkest, ugliest, most uninvolving and incomprehensible major-studio fantasies I've ever seen."
7153,dazed-and-confused-movie,Peter Travers,100,"Linklater is a sly and formidable talent, bringing an anthropologist's eye to this spectacularly funny celebration of the rites of stupidity. His shitfaced ""American Graffiti"" is the ultimate party movie -- loud, crude, socially irresponsible and totally irresistible."
7154,looking-glass-movie,Robert Abele,30,"Looking Glass ultimately feels trapped between leaning toward Lynchian identity weirdness and suggesting a classically character-driven slice of indie exploitation, despite a suitably retro Tangerine Dream-like score that vibrates suspensefully when needed."
7155,spread-movie,Melissa Anderson,20,"Spread becomes a sloggy, tepid comeuppance tale."
7156,kicking-and-screaming-movie,Barbara Shulgasser,25,"Baumbach is obviously a bright man, but this material is too thin for anything more than a slight New Yorker short story about thoughtful screw-ups."
7157,alice-through-the-looking-glass-movie,David Ehrlich,16,"As Alice runs from one hollow set piece to another, hitting every standard mark that a colossal movie like this must in order to pay for itself, her adventure grows less and less interesting with every turn. By the end, all that lessness is too much for the muchness to match it. Less is usually more, but when it comes to this franchise, none would be ideal."
7158,wild-things-movie,Rick Groen,25,This picture breaks through the limits and goes way beyond the pale -- it seems to enjoy irking us for the sheer hell of it.
7159,bruce-almighty-movie,Scott Tobias,0,"Even the most narcissistic jerk, like the one played by Jim Carrey in the loathsome comedy Bruce Almighty, would be expected to dream up untold pleasures for himself, acting as a self-serving genie with infinite wishes. "
7160,a-time-to-kill-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"There's no question the movie's entertaining. But the blatantly schematic depictions of black and white, liberal and hawk, and other tiresome dichotomies turn A Time to Kill into the moral equivalent of a cockfight."
7161,tangled-movie,Tasha Robinson,83,"The story should be a standard mismatched-couple-falls-in-love tale, but the script and the sprightly directing give the story plenty of snap and humor, and the animation is so luminously beautiful that even a falling-in-love sequence cribbed in part from The Little Mermaid is overwhelmingly magical."
7162,the-statement-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,90,"Has the hallmarks of a top-notch Jewison production -- splendid performances, especially from leads Michael Caine, Tilda Swinton and Jeremy Northam, a pulse-quickening pace and production values that establish story and character within a distinct environment. "
7163,izzy-gets-the-fck-across-town-movie,Richard Roeper,38,"The only thing less satisfying than the build-up is the finale, which goes from mind-boggling to you’ve got to be kidding me."
7164,thoroughbreds-movie,Fionnuala Halligan,80,Some zinging dialogue and pungent photography are complemented by the two young leads and the late Anton Yelchin in support.
7165,georgia-rule-movie,Michael Sragow,16,"Jane Fonda does an about-face on her persona and her talent, playing a teetotaler and, what's worse, a pious bore."
7166,the-avengers-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"This new film version, sad to say, is a hollow shell of the original series."
7167,no-reservations-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"I don't believe in fixing things that aren't broken. Sandra Nettelbeck's wholly accessible ""Mostly Martha"" (2001) is one of the most delightful comedies of recent years, so the idea of a remake with English instead of German dialogue is already pretty dubious, an insult to the capacities of both audiences and the original filmmakers."
7168,the-do-over-movie,Will Ashton,33,It’s just as predictably mind-numbing and tedious as any other comedy Sandler has attached his name to post-“Funny People.”
7169,catwoman-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Utterly devoid of merit, fantastic or otherwise, a more exasperating descent into the feline world is difficult to imagine. "
7170,serving-sara-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,20,"Long before Serving Sara drags its butt to the finish line, you wish you were watching a different race."
7171,finding-neverland-movie,Michael Sragow,88,"The glory of the movie is Depp, who achieves his own immortality."
7172,to-be-or-not-to-be-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"To Be is a very funny comedy, salted to taste with melodrama and satire."
7173,jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-movie,Matt Singer,30,This isn’t just a film you need to “turn off your brain” to enjoy; nothing less than surgically removing your brain from your body would do the trick.
7174,gigantic-movie,Scott Tobias,25,Any resemblance the film bears to real people and real situations is purely coincidental.
7175,austenland-movie,Stephanie Merry,37,The movie has an Austen-like plot about an Austen obsessive. And while Hess laboriously checks off so many familiar scenarios...the film doesn’t have so much of what makes Austen transcendent.
7176,friday-the-13th-part-2-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"This movie is a cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead teenager genres; about two dozen movies a year feature a mad killer going berserk, and they're all about as bad as this one. "
7177,intolerable-cruelty-movie,Michael Atkinson,80,"Zeta-Jones is merely ravishing, but Clooney owns the film. Ordinarily best at sardonic, man's-man confidence, he strides through Intolerable Cruelty with fantastic screwball zest. To see Clooney tenderize, season, grill, and serve this ham hock of a role is to see an old-fashioned virtuoso in perpetual motion. "
7178,the-best-of-me-movie,Bilge Ebiri,20,"In The Best of Me, the melodrama feels so hurried and half-baked that the end result isn’t just disappointing. It’s borderline infuriating."
7179,dead-man-movie,Barbara Shulgasser,25,"Particularly because unlike so many other boring movies one sees, Jarmusch films require many more words to explain the boringness than less certifiably artistic films would."
7180,ready-to-rumble-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,Let's be real clear about this: You've got to be suffering from some major trash-culture brain damage to enjoy a movie like Ready to Rumble.
7181,abandon-movie,Charles Taylor,30,"This alleged thriller, which might be described as ""'Gaslight' Goes to College,"" is one of the most incoherent features in recent memory."
7182,mr-deeds-movie,Peter Travers,10,"It's not just that the movie itself is wicked awful, it's that Mr. Deeds brings out the worst in Adam Sandler."
7183,night-of-the-living-dead-movie,Staff (Not Credited),80,"Despite mostly unprofessional acting, near nonexistent production values, homemade special effects, and cheap grainy black-and-white film stock, the film is a triumph."
7184,casino-royale-movie,Marc Savlov,78,"The good news is Craig, who was riveting as a London pharmaceutical salesman in the recent Brit import ""Layer Cake,"" is equally mesmerizing here."
7185,lethal-weapon-4-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,The most lethal weapon of all turns out to be the script.
7186,sils-maria-movie,Joe Neumaier,80,This is the film that fulfills whatever promise Kristen Stewart has shown for more than a decade.
7187,theres-something-about-mary-movie,Bob Graham,100,"In the person of Cameron Diaz, Mary is an island of sanity, good-natured humanity and genuine sweetness in an ocean of anarchy. Without her presence, There's Something About Mary would be merely sophomoric and tasteless."
7188,mile-22-movie,David Ehrlich,16,"Without a bloody foundation of truth to ground their swagger in reality or give it some kind of moral purpose, these two certified alpha males are completely lost; it’s like they were given all the various bits you need to assemble a watchable action movie, but went into production without any idea of how those pieces might fit together."
7189,pacific-rim-uprising-movie,David Fear,12,"This is Transformers-level inanity. This is a blow to your head from a mallet. It will not make you feel like a 10-year-old, but it will make you feel 10 years older than when you first entered the theater. It is certainly not personal in any way, shape or form, just strictly chilly, corporate to a fault and somehow both chintzy and wildly overblown. "
7190,winter-passing-movie,Roger Ebert,88,This is the kind of movie routinely dismissed as too slow and quiet by those who don't know it is more exciting to listen than to hear.
7191,quantum-of-solace-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"After the heights of ""Casino Royale,"" the series falls back into routine with this above-average thriller, filled with over-the-top action, familiar Bond atmosphere and a story that's impossible to follow - and why bother anyway? Daniel Craig is still the coolest man in the universe. That definitely helps."
7192,the-trip-to-italy-movie,Betsy Sharkey,90,"Brydon and Coogan's discourse over breakfast, lunch and dinner is captured with a casualness that makes the eavesdropping delicious."
7193,the-family-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"It’s too bad we can’t take a hit out on The Family. This unexciting, unfunny would-be action satire is filled with Italian-American stereotypes, decades-old TV-style Mafia cliches, bits of business that never amount to anything and actors so much better than the hoary, one-joke material."
7194,life-as-we-know-it-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,"The movie will surely find an audience, since it speaks to young people's anxieties about marriage and parenting. But what are two particularly engaging performers doing in a dump of a comedy like this?"
7195,the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn---part-2-movie,Sara Stewart,63,"Finally, someone took the source material at its terribly written word and stopped treating the whole affair so seriously. "
7196,act-of-valor-movie,Andrew Schenker,0,"A movie whose cinematic ineptitude is matched only by its ideological rottenness, Act of Valor features a cast of real-life active-duty Navy SEALS in order to grant the project's us-versus-them geopolitical worldview a sham moral authority. "
7197,gigli-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"Wretched. And while the dirtiest, low-rottenest part of me wouldn’t mind watching the institution of Ben/Jen get reamed, the heft of the blame should be shouldered by Hollywood vet Martin Brest, who wrote an incoherent, incompetent script and further mangled it with his direction."
7198,collateral-movie,David Ansen,80,"Mann vividly captures the nocturnal pulse of East L.A. in this taut, confined game of cat and mouse. In the homestretch the thrills get too generic and farfetched for their own good. But the first two thirds are a knockout. "
7199,the-fifth-estate-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,38,"The film is guilty of some of the same quick judgment it clearly doesn't endorse, exploiting Julian Assange's unmistakable appearance to help give itself a boogeyman."
7200,goodbye-world-movie,Katie Walsh,83,The strength of Goodbye World is that it understands the foibles of these characters and lets them be as flawed as they are while they are also trying to survive not just the apocalypse but each other.
7201,united-93-movie,Claudia Puig,100,"An unflinching, powerfully visceral and haunting portrait of the tragic events aboard one of the terrorist-commandeered flights on the fateful morning of Sept. 11, 2001."
7202,outlaws-and-angels-movie,Rex Reed,0,"No need to get worked up about Outlaws and Angels, a vile, nauseating and incomprehensible pile of saddles-and-spurs gibberish sane audiences will undoubtedly avoid at all costs."
7203,blood-work-movie,Ann Hornaday,80,"Eastwood's instinct for creating efficient, adult, mainstream entertainment is virtually unerring. He's still a class act, not to mention craggy, suave, laconic and very, very cool."
7204,incendies-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"The movie, engrossing as it is intentionally horrifying, is capped by a last-minute revelation that brings the story to a haunting, powerful close."
7205,repo-men-movie,Nick Pinkerton,0,"The movie shares this premise with 2008's ""Repo!: The Genetic Opera."" It would be worth researching who ripped off whom if both weren't ghastly."
7206,aliens-of-the-deep-movie,J. Hoberman,70,Often thrilling almost-feelie.
7207,in-good-company-movie,Mike Clark,75,Gives Dennis Quaid one of his best screen showcases.
7208,bushwick-movie,Duane Byrge,70,"What distinguishes Bushwick from your standard-issue, boneheaded video game is its cheeky cerebral wit."
7209,last-flag-flying-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"It plays like one of Linklater’s most intimate gifts, an adult rumination on the tricky subject of patriotism. "
7210,before-the-devil-knows-youre-dead-movie,Rick Kisonak,90,"Bleak, weirdly witty at times and unrelentingly suspenseful, Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead is the cinematic equivalent of a perfect storm."
7211,florence-foster-jenkins-movie,Peter Travers,75,"So, you're probably asking, what kind of a movie is this? A damn fine and funny one, thanks to the way the estimable director Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liaisons, The Grifters, The Queen) conducts the piece."
7212,annihilation-movie,Rex Reed,25,Annihilation is a demented science-fiction comic book of a movie that makes less sense than a butterfly mating with a buffalo.
7213,the-real-cancun-movie,Scott Tobias,0,"Save for the diminished allure of drunk, naked hotties, there's nothing of worth in The Real Cancun."
7214,dont-say-a-word-movie,Charles Taylor,10,"A stupid, brutal and nonsensical picture."
7215,big-eyes-movie,Ty Burr,38,"Big Eyes may not be Tim Burton’s absolute worst movie — we’ll always have “Planet of the Apes” — but it’s pretty close to the bottom. It’s also the film that reveals his weaknesses as a director and, by their absence, his strengths. Gaudy, shallow, shrill, smug, the movie proves beyond a whisker of doubt that Burton has little interest in human beings unless they can be reduced to cartoons."
7216,a-life-less-ordinary-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"The new film by the phenomenally talented Scots-English trio of director Danny Boyle, producer Andrew MacDonald and screenwriter John Hodge -- they did both ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Trainspotting"" -- is a failure so absolute and witless it deserves some kind of mention in the Hall of Lame."
7217,afternoon-delight-movie,Todd McCarthy,30,"It’s impossible to buy into the film’s plea to be taken seriously at the end, just as the upbeat finale feels false."
7218,sin-nombre-movie,Steven Rea,88,"Forceful, heart-wrenching stuff."
7219,the-mexican-movie,Robert Horton,10,Has even less directorial initiative than it has romantic spark.
7220,the-secret-life-of-walter-mitty-movie,Kyle Smith,38,"The story of a guy who never goes anywhere or does anything. Until he goes everywhere and does everything, but he might as well have stayed home."
7221,basmati-blues-movie,Derek Smith,12,Danny Baron's film awkwardly melds Bollywood romcom tropes with a half-hearted critique of the GMO industry.
7222,saint-john-of-las-vegas-movie,Stephen Holden,20,"This disjointed, desperately whimsical film is simply not funny: not for a minute."
7223,the-blues-brothers-movie,Martin Chilton,100,"The film also has stunning car chases, choreographed like the dancing in a musical, as the Blues Brothers are pursued throughout Chicago, at one point even tearing through a shopping mall, in their 'Bluesmobile', a retired 1974 Mount Prospect, Illinois Dodge Monaco patrol car."
7224,brother-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"Mr. Kitano directed, edited and wrote Brother -- and his style of close-to-the-vest brutality travels extremely well."
7225,jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-movie,Peter Travers,63,"Black is expectedly hilarious, but the beauty part of his performance is that, instead of exaggerating or patronizing this Instagram princess, he finds her vulnerable heart."
7226,hot-tub-time-machine-2-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,11,"Oh, for a time machine that would give me back the hour and a half I spent watching this movie."
7227,blindness-movie,Matthew Sorrento,10,The able cast can't swim through the muck.
7228,passengers-2016-movie,Tasha Robinson,30,"For all its visual flourishes and fair-to-decent acting, Passengers is a failure of a movie full of missed opportunities."
7229,the-generals-daughter-movie,Desson Thomson,70,"The movie, directed by Simon West isn't bad, although the repeated shots of Campbell lying spread-eagled on the ground, and the amount of detail we're forced to swallow about the horrors she underwent border on the offensive."
7230,almost-famous-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,80,"Like rock 'n' roll itself, the movie's really all about girls. Even when -- no, especially when -- it's pretending not to be."
7231,columbus-movie,Stephanie Merry,88,"The drama is a realistic and methodical meditation on family obligation, personal sacrifice and — of course — the power of architecture. That makes Columbus as lovely to look at as it is to ponder."
7232,superbad-movie,Stephen Farber,70,"Some of the patter is funny, but the movie lacks the clever plot developments and the character nuances of a classic like ""American Graffiti."" And it's missing the belly laughs of earlier raunchfests ""American Pie"" and ""There's Something About Mary."""
7233,nerve-movie,Steve Davis,67,"Up until now, Roberts and Franco have been second-tier actors in the industry food chain, but their first-rate performances in this better-than-average genre flick exude something called charisma. After this film, the two of them may graduate from watchers to players."
7234,the-corruptor-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"The director is James Foley, who is obviously not right for this material."
7235,phone-booth-movie,Peter Travers,75,"Farrell is a dynamo. And Kiefer Sutherland, whose sniper role is essentially a voice on the phone, matches Farrell subtle shift for subtle shift."
7236,red-road-movie,Desson Thomson,70,"Its story -- and eerie allure -- comes from our evolving perception of Jackie (Kate Dickie), a surveillance operator in Glasgow, Scotland, who spends long days and nights monitoring the screens."
7237,200-cigarettes-movie,Roger Ebert,12,Dreadful...Maybe another 200 cigarettes would have helped; coughing would be better than some of this dialogue.
7238,dear-white-people-movie,A.O. Scott,90,"You want to see this movie, and you will want to talk about it afterward, even if the conversation feels a little awkward. If it doesn’t, you’re doing it wrong. There is great enjoyment to be found here, and very little comfort."
7239,dear-white-people-movie,Steven Boone,88,"It's fortunate that, like ""The Social Network,"" Dear White People is so charismatic in form and style that we easily forgive its surfeit of priviliged narcissists. "
7240,the-sweetest-thing-movie,Dennis Lim,0,One of the cruddiest-looking movies ever made.
7241,dopamine-movie,Kevin Crust,70,"Overcomes some forced artiness to be a sweet, smart romance without being saccharine."
7242,kaboom-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"The movie has been cast, designed, clothed, scored and edited to the bleeding edge of hip, but it hasn't exactly been written."
7243,the-motorcycle-diaries-movie,David Sterritt,100,"One thing few will disagree on is the quality of the film's acting, especially by Gael García Bernal as Guevara and Rodrigo de la Serna as his friend. Both effortlessly embody the footloose, sometimes feckless quality of this ""On the Road""-style adventure."
7244,mustang-movie,Nicolas Rapold,100,"The ensemble of young actresses is a constantly restless and real presence, the perspective filtered mostly through the cheeky Lale but also through the group as a loving crew."
7245,midnight-sun-movie,Peter Debruge,30,"The trouble isn’t just that Midnight Sun cherry-picks the most poetic elements of a real-world disease to serve its transparently manipulative ends, but that it offers audiences such an unrealistic portrait of romance in the process."
7246,keeping-up-with-the-joneses-movie,Steve Persall,25,Keeping Up With the Joneses is the sort of strenuous comedy giving zany a bad name.
7247,twelve-years-a-slave-movie,Eric Kohn,100,"More than a powerful elegy, 12 Years a Slave is a mesmerizing triumph of art and polemics: McQueen turns a topic rendered distant by history into an experience that, short of living through the terrible era it depicts, makes you feel as if you've been there."
7248,virtuosity-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,33,"Washington is wasted here. Kelly Lynch is wooden.  Crowe has a ball going over the top, but how much taunting and eyeball popping can a performer do?"
7249,fair-game-movie,Kenneth Turan,0,Don't imagine there is any reason to see Fair Game.
7250,the-pacifier-movie,Owen Gleiberman,33,A yawn-by-numbers romper-room dud.
7251,dumb-and-dumberer-when-harry-met-lloyd-movie,J.R. Jones,20,"The best thing I can say about this limp prequel to the Farrelly brothers' Dumb & Dumber is that it obliged me to check out the original, which I'd been studiously avoiding for years. If you haven't seen it, it's pretty funny, and mercifully light on the scatology and cheap sentiment of later Farrelly efforts."
7252,west-of-memphis-movie,Steve Persall,91,"Thanks to Jackson's involvement as a producer, Berg has time and access Berlinger and Sinofsky didn't, allowing expansion of whatever material that's repeated."
7253,diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-movie,Lael Loewenstein,70,"It's a spry, fluffy comedy."
7254,mission-to-mars-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,One of the most gorgeous science-fiction movies ever - and probably also one of the most realistic in detail and scientific extrapolation
7255,nymphomaniac-volume-two-movie,Boyd van Hoeij ,83,"At its best, the film doesn't strain for meaning but instead treats all of its intellectualizing as a lark that can be taken seriously but doesn't need to be."
7256,wild-wild-west-movie,David Denby,10,"The movie is exhausting, utterly without feeling, and pointless -- though Smith looks great in his Western outfit."
7257,a-million-ways-to-die-in-the-west-movie,Drew Taylor,0,"It’s a lifeless, meandering, overlong (116 minutes!) trudge through the oversized ego of its creator, full of wrong-headed humor and inept filmmaking."
7258,random-hearts-movie,Diana Abu-Jaber,8,Dissects the dicey question of fidelity with all the finesse of a Veg-O-Matic and leaves us with something closer to chopped liver than broken hearts.
7259,the-cobbler-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,"The Cobbler is such a weirdly somber comedy that it would almost be in poor taste to laugh during it, though there’s not much danger of that happening. "
7260,mr-roosevelt-movie,David Ehrlich,75,"Mr. Roosevelt is a sweet and shaggy comedy about someone who needs to renovate their idea of home. It’s a reminder that the 21st century is going to be full of coming-of-age films about 30-year-olds, and it’s compelling evidence that that might be alright."
7261,the-road-to-guantanamo-movie,Ruthe Stein,100,A film that must be seen to understand the sad truths of our times. It's been made with a sensitivity and creativity that's come to exemplify Winterbottom's work.
7262,freddy-got-fingered-movie,Robert Horton,10,Do not bring children to this movie unless you want them to have nightmares for weeks.
7263,overboard-2018-movie,Derek Smith,25,All of the broad physical humor in the world can't distract from the fact that the film is an endorsement of psychological exploitation.
7264,ripd-movie,Gabe Toro,0,"This expensive misfire runs a little less than ninety minutes, which means that there’s likely a 105-110 minute long version that the producers hacked up in order to get the maximum amount of 3D showtimes to not embarrass the studio on opening weekend. Judging by the released product, that version is likely even worse, if such a thing were possible. "
7265,badlands-movie,Pauline Kael,30,"There's a basic flaw in Malick's method: he has perceived the movie--he's done our work instead of his.  In place of people and action, with metaphor rising out of the story, he gives us a surface that is all conscious metaphor.  Badlands is so preconceived that there's nothing left to respond to. [18 March 1974, p.135]"
7266,phantom-of-the-paradise-movie,Pauline Kael,90,"The film is a one-of-a-kind entertainment, with a kinetic, breakneck wit."
7267,the-red-turtle-movie,Eric Kohn,100,"This is a quiet little masterpiece of images, each one rich with meaning, that collectively speak to a universal process. "
7268,the-dictator-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"Cohen probably thinks he's Charlie Chaplin lampooning Hitler, but of course Hitler was still on top of the world when ""The Great Dictator"" came out in 1940; Cohen is actually Chaplin's antithesis, a first-world bully content to target the Other. "
7269,standing-tall-movie,Clayton Dillard,38,"The film quickly devolves into a contemptible, exploitative presentation of sociological matters."
7270,anton-chekhovs-the-duel-movie,J. Hoberman,90,"The Duel is the most successful literary adaptation I've seen since Pascal Ferran's 2006 ""Lady Chatterley."""
7271,whipped-movie,Ken Fox,30,A misconceived roundelay that crosses the thin line dividing gross-but-funny from just plain gross.
7272,jason-x-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"The only chills to be found are courtesy of your theater's central air, and the suspense will come from the wait to see which disappointed kid in a hockey mask will be the first to slash the screen."
7273,dead-man-movie,Mike Clark,38,"Coy to a fault, the movie collapses under its own weight with 90 minutes to go, despite Robby Muller's impressive black-and-white photography, which puts the film on a higher artistic plane than other equally unbearable movies. [16 May 1996, Pg.06.D]"
7274,northfork-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,"Gets under your skin with its graceful edits and poetic elisions, lovely performances, and faded imagery. "
7275,brick-mansions-movie,Bilge Ebiri,30,"It should be wilder, funnier, nuttier. "
7276,vice-2015-movie,Chris Packham,30,"The film unspools with a momentum that mitigates its artless brutality, kinda, but it's a high-pressure firehose of stupid."
7277,the-man-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,10,"Fuu . . . cryin' out loud, this movie's dumb."
7278,it-might-get-loud-movie,Sam Adams,67,"The resulting jam session ought to be a music geek’s wet dream, but there isn’t enough common ground to produce more than a few flashes of inspiration."
7279,star-trek-beyond-movie,Kimberley Jones,30,"Lin’s F&F films are operatically dumb, which was what makes them so much fun; maybe if Star Trek Beyond were stupider it wouldn’t feel like such a chore."
7280,vampire-academy-movie,Randy Cordova,30,"The film is based on a popular series of young-adult books (big surprise), but one figures only die-hard fans will enjoy the result. The movie is slow-witted and moves at a glacial pace."
7281,underworld-blood-wars-movie,Roger Moore,25,"The action beats are barely passable — glitchy, pixelated jerks in the digitally-augmented jumps, punches, etc. The production design — dark on dark, all the better to hide the bored actors."
7282,bones-movie,Joe Leydon,80,"A sly mix of haunted house melodrama, slasher pic mayhem and retro-blaxploitation iconography, spiced with dollops of grisly, dark comedy."
7283,blackthorn-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,38,"Blackthorn feels less like a proper sequel to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" which it purports to be, than a coattail rider. "
7284,abcd-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,38,"Madhur Jaffrey and Faran Tahir fare considerably better as Nina's conservative mother and brother, leaving us confused ourselves: Why didn't Patel focus on them, instead?"
7285,after-the-sunset-movie,Jen Chaney,30,A purported heist flick that sucks all the style out of stealing.
7286,the-art-of-getting-by-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"Flaccid, endlessly irksome coming-of-age drama. "
7287,amelie-movie,Manohla Dargis,20,Sucks -- because it's a frenetic bore that insists on its audience's adoration while making no demands upon their intelligence.
7288,son-of-the-mask-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"What the filmmakers missed in assuming the mask from the earlier film is that it was Carrey's astonishing physical comedy that made that film a hit, not the animation."
7289,anatomy-of-hell-movie,Ella Taylor,10,Anatomy of Hell offers one of the most hateful and mechanical representations of sexuality I've ever seen. 
7290,john-tucker-must-die-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"Whatever the target demographic was in the pre-production phase, now it's limited to sexually active 14-year-olds still retaking the sixth grade."
7291,the-hurricane-movie,Shawn Levy,91,"This is some of the finest acting you will see on-screen, maybe ever. Single-handedly, Washington turns The Hurricane from so-so to must-see."
7292,nine-lives-2016-movie,Devan Coggan,16,"Watching these videos of actual cats, all of whom have racked up countless views on YouTube, just serves to underscore how unfunny and neutered Nine Lives actually is."
7293,the-ballad-of-jack-and-rose-movie,David Ansen,80,"Day-Lewis, who imbues Jack with a ravaged, Keith Richards charisma, is once again extraordinary."
7294,misery-loves-comedy-movie,Drew Hunt,25,"Commingling industry shoptalk with introspective insights and wrangling testimonials, the film casts an incredibly wide net, but doesn't reveal much of anything. "
7295,passion-of-mind-movie,Emanuel Levy,20,"This small-scale, chamber piece, which boasts good acting from Moore, Skarsgard and Fichtner, has a strong built-in appeal for women but may experience harder times in going beyond the specialized arthouse circuits due to the narrowly-scoped, undernourished script."
7296,the-lure-movie,Simon Abrams,63,Watching The Lure is a bit like having manic depression—the thrilling high points are just as relentless as the crushing low-tide ebbs.
7297,dont-tell-mom-the-babysitters-dead-movie,Ellen Futterman,38,"The baby sitter isn't the only thing dead in this movie - the plot also suffered a massive coronary while being scripted. In fact, the only life breathed into Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead is the light comedic performance of Christina Applegate (Married . . . With Children), with an assist from Keith Coogan. [13 June 1991, p.6E]"
7298,mysteries-of-lisbon-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,100,"Once you start to ride with the rapturous, gorgeous, digressive symphony of images and words and music in this film it's completely absorbing and unlike anything you've ever seen. "
7299,manchester-by-the-sea-movie,Chris Nashawaty,100,"Affleck has never had a role that matches his minimal, anti-charisma style like this one. His tendency to be mumbly and awkward and withholding fits his character perfectly. And Hedges, as a temperamental teenager working through loss in his own authentically teenage way, is a real discovery. Michelle Williams, as Lee’s ex-wife, doesn’t get many scenes, but she cracks your heart open in the ones she has."
7300,the-last-exorcism-part-ii-movie,Tim Robey,20,"The actual exorcism sequence, involving three well-meaning cult members and a chicken, is strangely uneventful – and if there’s one thing a movie exorcism should never, ever be, it’s that. "
7301,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,William Arnold,16,It doesn't have the imagination or daring to make a full turn to self-parody.
7302,repo-men-movie,Carrie Rickey,38,"As an account of how for-profit big business literally rips a consumer's heart out, Repo Men is too graphic for me."
7303,a-very-harold-kumar-christmas-movie,Peter Travers,25,"We're getting more of the same, but less of the impact, like weed from a bad dealer."
7304,the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-3d-movie,Nick Schager,12,"There's no deliberate Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2-style comedy to the film, just dim-witted gruesomeness retrofitted with gimmicky contemporary trappings."
7305,the-contender-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,It's an intelligent and informed look at the preposterous ways our leaders are often picked and sabotaged.
7306,machine-gun-preacher-movie,Tasha Robinson,75,"Machine Gun Preacher is stirring when it presents Childers as a hero, but it does its most impressive work when it addresses him as a flawed, struggling, but still determined man."
7307,swing-vote-movie,Michael Phillips,63,This one may be soft and derivative. But the actors establish a groove and stay on-message.
7308,bubble-boy-movie,Bruce Fretts,0,"After enduring only a few minutes of this shrill debacle, you'll feel more trapped in the theater than Jimmy is by his bubble."
7309,fat-albert-movie,Desson Thomson,70,"Seems like a pretty cool movie -- at least, for a remake of a 1970s Saturday morning TV show."
7310,timbuktu-movie,Jessica Kiang,83,"For all its value in bearing witness to the kind of atrocious acts that get but little attention on the world stage, this is not mere testimony, this is cleverly crafted and remarkably affecting storytelling."
7311,the-beverly-hillbillies-movie,Rick Groen,25,"Barely dusted off, the humourless stuff is served up straight- damned if it isn't a Hillbillies homage. [19 Oct 1993]"
7312,star-wars-episode-v---the-empire-strikes-back-movie,David Sterritt,100,Technical virtuosity and entertainment ingenuity.
7313,elektra-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Another inert, soul-dead action drama that turns actors into zombies...It's garbage."
7314,hudson-hawk-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"This may be the only would-be blockbuster that's a sprawling, dissociated mess on purpose. It's a perverse landmark: the first postmodern Hollywood disaster."
7315,the-amazing-spider-man-2-movie,James Rocchi,30,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2, is just good enough to make you painfully aware of all the ways it's not good at all."
7316,morning-movie,Sara Stewart,38,It often seems like an acting workshop: Behave as if you are the parent of a dead child.
7317,sanctum-movie,Marc Savlov,20,"Those audiences who have complained about the clunky exposition and mawkish emotional dialogue in Cameron's films will discover the ""King of the World""'s own dramatic talents to be on par with the Bard in comparison to the shouty, over-emoted hokum on display here."
7318,body-shots-movie,Charles Taylor,30,"A grim, sour view of single life."
7319,the-legend-of-hercules-movie,Randy Cordova,10,"The whole thing is a total bore; even the supporting players aren’t motivated enough to attract attention. That’s good news for Lutz; he can’t be blamed for torpedoing the project, because everyone is doing subpar work here."
7320,oz-the-great-and-powerful-movie,Scott Foundas,30,"Oz tilts towards the mawkish, as the sham wizard learns the value of selflessness and an incessant Danny Elfman score tugs so shamelessly at your tear ducts that it would make the Tin Man surrender his heart on the spot."
7321,dear-wendy-movie,Staff (Not credited),10,"Is there anything more tedious than the guy who complains and complains about something he knows nothing about? Danish cinema auteur Lars von Trier has never been to the United States because he's afraid of flying, yet he seems determined to keep making movies about how horrible this country is."
7322,30-beats-movie,Diego Semerene,25,"While it lends itself to some interesting insight on the politics of non-exclusive, fuck-buddy dynamics, its characters are ultimately too one-dimensional and their dialogue too theatrical to sustain an involving cinematic experience."
7323,the-canyons-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Paul Schrader’s The Canyons is not the worst movie of 2013 — it's marginally better than ""InAPPpropriate Comedy"" and ""Scary Movie 5,"" two even worse bombs that Lindsay Lohan also lent her rapidly diminishing talents to — but it is surely the most boring I’ve seen."
7324,annihilation-movie,Jake Coyle,75,"Rarely has a film conjured such a thick atmosphere of dread and wonder as “Annihilation,” a movie that unfolds, grippingly, as an existential mystery."
7325,mr-magoriums-wonder-emporium-movie,Laura Repstad,25,"For a movie built around a brightly-colored, magical toy store, Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is surprisingly forgettable. In fact, it's most wondrous feat is just how it manages to waste good actors and fine performances."
7326,the-matrix-movie,Rod Dreher,75,"It's like animation come to three-dimensional life, and f/x addicts as well as sci-fi fans will not want to miss a split-second."
7327,rush-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,83,"Rush is a pretty thrilling piece of pop entertainment. It's excitingly assembled and moves like a bullet, highly engaging and nerve-wracking when it needs to be and light on its feet elsewhere."
7328,all-about-steve-movie,Ty Burr,0,"Easily the worst movie of the week, month, year, and Bullock’s entire career. It is to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away."
7329,the-honeymooners-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,38,"At least The Honeymooners is not one of those remakes that looks bad compared to the original. It's just bad, period."
7330,black-hawk-down-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"One hell of a ride. For better or for worse, it will leave you stunned and reeling."
7331,forgetting-sarah-marshall-movie,Carina Chocano,70,"The movie's big revelation, though, is Brand's Aldous, whose idiot-Lothario exterior masks a frank, accidentally wise and Yoda-like interior, and whom we grow to like more and more despite getting to better know him and his faults. The same can be said about the movie."
7332,young-adam-movie,Lawrence Toppman,63,"All the actors give performances so low-key they're almost minimalist. That works, except when we're supposed to believe every woman would throw herself at the closed-off Joe. "
7333,x-men-first-class-movie,Todd McCarthy,80,"Audacious, confident and fueled by youthful energy."
7334,no-escape-movie,Jake Cole,0,The only way that this film could be any more racist is if the Dwyer family holed up with Lillian Gish and waited for the Klan to save them.
7335,marina-abramovic-the-artist-is-present-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"""It is extremely difficult to be like a mountain, to create stillness in the middle of hell,"" is how Abramovic describes her task. The most resonant part of this surprisingly emotional film demonstrates how powerful this interaction is, how it expresses something that is no less moving for being, literally, beyond words."
7336,alex-cross-movie,Chris Cabin,12,"Expositional and often self-serious to the point of genuine awkwardness, the dialogue is never as haltingly unconvincing as when it's attempting to give some approximation of Alex Cross's essential looseness and good humor."
7337,alex-emma-movie,Lawrence Toppman,38,"Wilson brings low-wattage amiability to his part, as always. Hudson's mismatched with him but tries to set him afire."
7338,action-point-movie,Peter Travers,25,A few primo bits sneak through.... But mostly we’re watching the bawdy life being drained out of a once subversive franchise. Action Point is the first Jackass-related movie to play it safe. Now that is truly painful.
7339,pay-it-forward-movie,Dennis Lim,0,An overflowing septic tank of chicken-soupy sanctimony that proceeds from casually offensive hypocrisy to wretchedly inapt religiosity.
7340,blade-runner-2049-movie,Jordan Farley,100,An exquisitely crafted sequel that stands shoulder to shoulder with one of the greatest films ever made. Everyone involved is operating at the height of their powers.
7341,natural-born-killers-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,78,"Berserk from the outset, Natural Born Killers lunges for our collective viscera in its opening sequence (surely one of the most brilliant establishing sequences of all time) and never lets go for the next two hours."
7342,the-invisible-woman-movie,Todd McCarthy,100,"A career high point for Ralph Fiennes as both an actor and director, this unfussy and emotionally penetrating work also provides lead actress Felicity Jones with the prime role in which she abundantly fulfills the promise suggested in some of her earlier small films."
7343,hollow-man-movie,Kenneth Turan,10,"Despite a wealth of special effects...this movie is surprisingly inert, more dull than anything else, with little to recommend it on any level."
7344,the-only-living-boy-in-new-york-movie,Glenn Whipp,10,"""Only Living Boy"" fails to convince as a character study, romance or love letter to the CBGB-era New York City. It drops a plot bombshell close to the end of its 88-minute running time, but the filmmakers haven’t laid the track to make it plausible."
7345,twenty-feet-from-stardom-movie,Peter Rainer,100,"I have rarely seen a movie that better expressed the revivifying nature of music. (Many of the women, not surprisingly, grew up singing gospel in church choirs and had preachers for parents.)"
7346,together-2001-movie,Peter Rainer,90,Moodysson captures exactly the preening narcissism and gumption of these frazzled would-be revolutionaries trying to wriggle out of their bourgeois straitjackets.
7347,x-men-days-of-future-past-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"I couldn’t follow many of the ins and outs of the time-travel scenario, and I’m not altogether sure that the filmmakers could, either. It doesn’t really matter. It’s enough that the movie is fun. We shouldn’t also expect it to make sense."
7348,book-of-shadows-blair-witch-2-movie,Wesley Morris,12,Cult shocker has been turned into throwaway megaplex fodder.
7349,the-astronaut-farmer-movie,Scott Foundas,80,"This is gloriously self-aware hokum, a fantasy movie that is, above all, about our need for fantasy and escapism -- and even our need for movies like  The Astronaut Farmer  -- to help us combat the depression and disappointments of the everyday."
7350,wonder-woman-movie,Andrew Barker,80,"Wonder Woman is the first major studio superhero film directed by a woman, and it shows in a number of subtle, yet important ways."
7351,beasts-of-the-southern-wild-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,"A mixture of magical realism, Southern gothic, coming-of-age movie, star turn for first-timers, disaster story and out-and-out strangeness. It's unlike any film you've seen."
7352,42-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Helgeland works in what I think of as a conservative — or maybe it's just really, really basic — neoclassical Hollywood style, spelling everything out, letting the story unfold in a plainspoken and deliberate fashion, with a big, wide, open pictorial camera eye. It's like the latter-day Clint Eastwood style, applied to material that's as traditional as can be."
7353,saving-silverman-movie,Peter Travers,10,"Peet is always worth watching, but the role does her no favors, and the script, involving a kidnapping and a surprise cameo by Neil Diamond - you heard me - smacks of desperation beyond saving."
7354,the-heartbreak-kid-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,"The ethnic humor that gave May's movie its charge is replaced by crass mean-spiritedness. If I were in movie hell, I'd rather see ""Good Luck Chuck"" again than return to this atrocity."
7355,slumdog-millionaire-movie,Joe Morgenstern,100,Slumdog Millionaire is the film world's first globalized masterpiece.
7356,the-cruise-movie,Kevin Thomas,100,The Cruise validates beautifully a life that is its own validation.
7357,the-dark-tower-movie,Richard Roeper,25,"The cinematography has a washed-out, dull tone. The special effects are mediocre. With a few exceptions, the dialogue is stilted and filled with expository passages so obviously intended to explain things to us, I half-expected characters to turn to the camera and say, “Here’s what you need to know so you can understand what’s happening.”"
7358,the-untold-story-of-emmett-louis-till-movie,Carrie Rickey,75,"The heroine of this story is the eloquent Mamie Till-Mobley, Emmett's mother, who recalls her fight to have an open-casket funeral for her son."
7359,lean-on-pete-movie,Richard Roeper,100,"As the film takes deeper and darker turns, it also becomes something special, something unflinchingly honest, something that will punch you in the gut AND touch your heart."
7360,spiral-2002-movie,Edward Crouse,70,"With playful, compelling gore having slowed to a near trickle stateside, Uzumaki demands attention."
7361,dragonslayer-1981-movie,Roger Ebert,75,"The scenes involving the dragon are first-rate. The beast is one of the meanest, ugliest, most reprehensible creatures I've ever seen in a film, and when it breathes flames it looks like it's really breathing flames."
7362,bronson-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,80,"Refn has somehow found his way to an authentic English hard-man drama, anchored in a dynamite performance, even as it celebrates thug life."
7363,jawbreaker-movie,Nathan Rabin,20,"A nasty black comedy whose relentlessly glossy exterior recalls both Araki and John Waters without the wit or smarts of either...As a black comedy, Jawbreaker has one major flaw: It's not funny."
7364,charlie-wilsons-war-movie,Michael Sragow,83,Philip Seymour Hoffman steals the movie.
7365,7-chinese-brothers-movie,John DeFore,70,"Byington's two-chuckle-a-minute script is mostly interested in Larry's constant, evasive patter, which continues whether the target of his words appears to care what he's saying or not."
7366,let-it-ride-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"The movie is so witless and confused in tone that its seedy racetrack clientele only emerge as dim, inarticulate cartoons."
7367,hobo-with-a-shotgun-movie,Noel Murray,75,"It's a hyper-violent, self-conscious throwback, with the sickly plastic aroma of a tape that's been gathering dust in the corner of a video store since 1984."
7368,sex-and-lucia-movie,Marta Barber,75,"Medem may have disrobed most of the cast, leaving their bodies exposed, but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt. That's why Sex and Lucía is so alluring."
7369,donnie-darko-the-directors-cut-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,100,"In this bolder, longer new cut, characters are allowed to finish scenes previously left as DVD extras, effects are creepier, and the theories of ""the Tangent Universe"" are explored in greater depth. Friends and neighbors, this is a Great American Movie."
7370,jefferson-in-paris-movie,Hal Hinson,30,"So what exactly is the point? Does Jefferson's treatment of Sally Hemings establish his racism or his instinctive color-blindness? Unfortunately, the picture is so unfocused and tumbles so rapidly from one event to another that it's difficult to tell."
7371,the-story-of-us-movie,David Sterritt,25,"Audiences may want their own speedy divorce from this irritating collection of stale jokes, pointless vulgarities, and warmed-over clichés."
7372,simply-irresistible-movie,Paul Malcolm,20,"A betrayal of all things Buffy, not to mention a complete waste of Gellar’s strengths as a young actress. Even the most hardcore of her fans would do well to give it a miss."
7373,bad-education-movie,David Denby,90,"Complex and devious beyond easy recounting, Bad Education is about the fallout from the ending of a ""pure"" love between boys, consecrated in an Almodóvaran temple--a movie theatre."
7374,nobel-son-movie,Nathan Rabin,16,"Nobel Son sadistically resurrects the Tarantino knockoff--an unloved, foul-mouthed little bastard of a subgenre that should now go away forever."
7375,jupiter-ascending-movie,Alonso Duralde,85,Who cares if the story is occasionally impenetrable or if some gags land with a thud when the thrills and the eye candy keep coming at such a breathless pace? Jupiter Ascending doesn’t break the new ground that the Wachowskis have managed in the past...but the film never slacks in its efforts to wow us.
7376,orlando-movie,Rita Kempley,80,"Swinton is elegantly comic, but also strangely cartoonish.... A funny and forthright screen presence, she is the foil for the stately pace and the opulent sets -- the most ravishing since ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" There is only one conclusion: Potter, the little smarty-pants, is pulling our cross-gartered gams. She's having us on with this spoof of the prissy masterpiece theatricality."
7377,adult-world-movie,Gary Goldstein,80,"Brimming with sharp asides and clever throwaways...plus astute observations on literary pretension and misguided youth, Adult World is a winner."
7378,uncovered-the-whole-truth-about-the-iraq-war-movie,V.A. Musetto,25,"Greenwald does nothing with the interviews, basically just posting them, one after the other, with the hope that viewers will do his job for him. The result is one-sided and bone-dry. "
7379,buybust-movie,Katie Walsh,70,"In the cynical worldview of BuyBust, there’s no escaping this crushing cycle of killing and corruption. That real-life message makes this wild action film more powerful, but the violence is a hard pill to swallow."
7380,jimmy-p-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"Del Toro overdoes the anguish to the point of looking like he’s playing advanced constipation, and the film, by France’s Arnaud Desplechin, gets stuck in an endless series of therapy scenes built around cheesy re-enactments of Jimmy P’s dreams."
7381,the-lone-ranger-movie,Ann Hornaday,25,"This mishmash of styles, genres and tonal shifts makes for a dizzying pastiche best described in terms of the many movies it references throughout its nearly 2 1/2-hour running time, from “Little Big Man,” Buster Keaton’s “The General” and the Monument Valley-set canon of John Ford to “Dead Man,” “Rango” and “Pirates of the Caribbean.”"
7382,love-simon-movie,Sheila O'Malley,88,"Director Greg Berlanti, who has helmed a string of hit television shows as producer and writer, uses the familiar teenage romance genre to tell an LGBTQ story, and in so doing makes these tropes feel fresh, fun, entertaining. "
7383,land-of-the-lost-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"This dramatically, thematically and artistically bankrupt comic fantasy cost something in the neighborhood of $100 million to make and isn't worth the celluloid it's printed on."
7384,inside-job-movie,Ann Hornaday,88,"If you think you've absorbed all you could about subprime mortgages, credit default swaps and the arcana of elaborate derivatives, think again. Inside Job traces the history of the crisis and its implications with exceptional lucidity, rigor and righteous indignation."
7385,the-manchurian-candidate-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"A political thriller that manages to be at once silly and clever, buoyantly satirical and sneakily disturbing, but he (Demme) has recovered some of the lightness and sureness of touch that had faded from his movies after ""The Silence of the Lambs."""
7386,tokyo-godfathers-movie,Carla Meyer,75,Gorgeous animated film. 
7387,the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug-movie,Colette Bancroft,75,Never mind the dwarves and elves and wizards — maybe even the hobbit. The star of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the dragon.
7388,the-snowman-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"A leaden, clotted, exasperating mess."
7389,dungeons-dragons-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"This dragon, sadly, is DOA."
7390,the-big-sick-movie,Gary Thompson,88,"The Big Sick is romantic and funny, but the movie is way too sprawling and ambitious to be contained by the words romantic comedy."
7391,superman-movie,Judith Martin,80,"it's the simple, earth-bound quality of the film that makes this comic-book fantasy soar."
7392,gi-joe-retaliation-movie,Steve Persall,25,"This movie never realizes how ridiculous anything it does truly is, right up to the last-second promise of another sequel."
7393,secretary-movie,Michael Wilmington,38,"Though I would agree it's original -- it's the first aboveground romance movie I've seen in which the heroine is repeatedly spanked, verbally tormented and tied to a chair by her lover--- it's not an experience I much enjoyed."
7394,abcs-of-death-2-movie,Rob Staeger,70,"Overall, it's a strong sampler, with surprising variety."
7395,if-i-stay-movie,Jon Frosch,30,"Stacy Keach provides a bit of relief from all the oppressive earnestness in his brief appearance as Mia’s grandfather, evoking a depth of feeling otherwise missing here."
7396,secret-in-their-eyes-movie,Eric Henderson,38,"Billy Ray unfurls the parallel time structure with the same flat, procedural monotony applied by Juan José Campanella to the original film."
7397,a-perfect-world-movie,Edward Guthmann,75,"Costner and Lowther are a winning pair, and Eastwood, an elegant director, takes his time telling the story, seasoning it with frequent humor and avoiding the logistics of the manhunt. [24 Nov 1993, p.E1]"
7398,standing-ovation-movie,Pete Hammond,20,"This is the kind of movie where the audience of extras orgasmically react after every song as if they were at a Bruce Springsteen concert instead of watching a bunch of kids who wouldn't make the cut in a junior high production of ""Bye Bye Birdie."""
7399,the-door-in-the-floor-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,70,By the end the story is more satisfying than you might expect.
7400,something-in-the-air-movie,A.A. Dowd ,83,"Because of its autobiographical slant, Something In The Air has been compared to Assayas’ 1994 breakthrough, ""Cold Water,"" which gazed upon roughly the same period of the director’s life. "
7401,may-movie,Dennis Lim,20,The flavor is textbook '90s indie -- self-regarding quirk with an occasional spasm of Solondzian incorrectness. 
7402,below-movie,William Arnold,16,An excruciatingly awful thriller.
7403,swingers-movie,F. X. Feeney,81,"Has such perfect pitch in small matters that, as it builds, it proves no less capable in tackling bigger issues--and what begin as chuckles become deep belly laughs."
7404,max-movie,Kenneth Turan,30,"Just because people are objecting to Max for all the wrong reasons doesn't make it a good film, and it's not. It's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script, unimpressive acting and indifferent direction."
7405,suffragette-movie,Roger Moore,88,"In the best picture of 2015, Carey Mulligan is the stoic, long-suffering sweatshop worker radicalized into action."
7406,evening-movie,Keith Phipps,25,"Evening proves that there are such things as mistakes, by featuring two hours of bad choices and half-executed ideas."
7407,the-long-kiss-goodnight-movie,Peter Travers,75,"Geena Davis and her director and husband, Renny Harlin, recover from their ""Cutthroat Island"" fiasco in grand style, and screenwriter Shane Black (""The Last Boy Scout"") juggles jolts and jokes with a mad fervor that almost earns him his $4 million salary."
7408,extremely-loud-and-incredibly-close-movie,Pete Hammond,90,"It's an emotional powerhouse of a film, an unforgettable and rewarding motion picture experience."
7409,the-two-jakes-movie,Hal Hinson,10,What The Two Jakes makes us long for most is the earlier film.
7410,the-magnificent-seven-2016-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,25,"It would be too easy to say The Magnificent Seven isn’t magnificent. It’s definitely not, but the film has an even more egregious quality: it’s uninspired. There’s no risk, no real attempts to subvert expectations, and no desire to truly give the audience something, if not entirely new, then at least surprising."
7411,sinister-2-movie,Andrew Barker,30,"A retread of such brainless, shameless lameness that it’s hard to imagine anyone begging for another installment."
7412,50-first-dates-movie,Ty Burr,63,"The plot -- it's inspired and ridiculous at the same time -- is best described as ""Groundhog Day"" meets ""Memento."" "
7413,rebel-in-the-rye-movie,Robert Abele,25,"Rebel in the Rye is the most dispiritingly presentational of biopics, on a tight schedule to hit its marks and compartmentalize its subject’s life."
7414,grizzly-man-movie,Scott Foundas,100,"A brilliant portrait of adventure, activism, obsession and potential madness that ranks among helmer Werner Herzog's strongest work."
7415,v-for-vendetta-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"V for Vendetta represents 2006's first memorable motion picture - a visually sumptuous concoction that combines political allegory, bloody action, and a few stunning cinematic moments into a solid piece of entertainment."
7416,the-fall-movie,Marc Savlov,78,The Fall lives and dies on the strength of Pace and Untaru's remarkable performances. It's there that the pulsing heart of this magical-real film beats most true.
7417,the-fighter-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"The rousing The Fighter tries a number of risky maneuvers and manages to make them pay off in the end. The movie initially feels like more of a near thing than the filmmakers anticipated, but as in boxing it's only the final decision that counts."
7418,fed-up-movie,Marc Mohan,83,"A surprisingly in-depth and confrontational examination into the obesity epidemic among Americans, especially children, over the last 30 years."
7419,crimes-and-misdemeanors-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,20,None of the characters or ideas is allowed to develop beyond its cardboard profile.
7420,inside-job-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"Name names, please. Or shut up."
7421,before-the-devil-knows-youre-dead-movie,Glenn Kenny,88,"The action is violent, messy, and threaded through with dark humor. This is a movie for grownups, for sure, but it has a mulish kick that most such pictures consider themselves to tasteful to aspire to."
7422,an-education-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"Afterward, you'll want to listen to the Beatles sing ''She's Leaving Home.'' It might be a girl like Jenny the lads had in mind."
7423,the-shawshank-redemption-movie,Elvis Mitchell,90,"There are times when The Shawshank Redemption comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained.  [23 Sept 1994, p.C3]"
7424,time-out-movie,Peter Rainer,100,"A hushed, small-scale masterpiece that moves into the shadowlands of tragedy."
7425,i-melt-with-you-movie,Nick Schager,12,"The only thing more narcissistically indulgent than the film's repugnant protagonists is Mark Pellington's iPod-scored, visually flashy, thoroughly hollow directorial celebration of them."
7426,the-girl-cut-in-two-movie,John Anderson,70,"For all its charisma, A Girl Cut in Two lacks a certain depth."
7427,japanese-story-movie,Peter Rainer,90,Tsunashima gives a deft performance in a role that starts out as caricature but becomes full-bodied. Collette commands the screen virtually the entire time. 
7428,i-shot-andy-warhol-movie,Elvis Mitchell,80,The film's greatest directorial success is in finding a thoroughly entertaining way of inviting the audience to share Valerie's point of view.
7429,reprise-movie,Michael Phillips,100,"A kinetic delight, Reprise comes from director Joachim Trier, born in Denmark but raised in Oslo, Norway, and it’s a highlight of the filmgoing year so far."
7430,last-orders-movie,Michael Atkinson,30,"The carload of codgers in Fred Schepisi's Last Orders merely bellyache, philosophize, crack unfunny jokes, and ruminate simplemindedly about Death."
7431,adrift-2018-movie,Rex Reed,100,"It’s a true story, basically a two-hander about a pair of courageous lovers lost at sea, as crushingly hard to imagine as it is to watch, but every element is so perfect that it left me shaking and devastated."
7432,alex-emma-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,How could a movie with such likable actors be so deeply dislikable? 
7433,the-third-murder-movie,Deborah Young,90,"Though different in feeling from the Japanese writer-director's perceptive family tales like After the Storm, it has the same clarity of thought and precision of image as his very best work."
7434,in-good-company-movie,M. E. Russell,75,"A modest movie full of decent pop songs, three-dimensional humans and sharp observations about the male mind. It's also full of funny little ironies."
7435,grind-movie,Scott Foundas,0,"A crass, condescending piece of corporate bamboozling, Grind plays like a movie conceived by monkey-suited honchos who regard their targeted audience as impressionable nincompoops susceptible to every new trend in sports, clothing and music that comes down the pike."
7436,rocknrolla-movie,Andrea Gronvall,0,Frenetic and self-conscious to the point of tedium.
7437,mickey-blue-eyes-movie,Desson Thomson,30,About as funny as digging your own grave in an unmarked part of New Jersey.
7438,paycheck-movie,Peter Travers,25,"The title of this limp retread of ""Minority Report"" -- both films are based on stories by Philip K. Dick -- presumably refers to the reason the big names involved did this movie."
7439,2-guns-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"The director mixes the colors of his palette carefully. He uses (but never overuses) slow-motion, aerial shots, extreme close-ups and quick cuts, avoiding any self-consciously “stylish” display. He varies the pace of scenes and the angle of shots enough to keep the movie flowing, but we never feel we’re watching someone show us how clever he is."
7440,last-orders-movie,Ella Taylor,90,"Superbly adapted by Fred Schepisi from the Booker Prize-winning novel by Graham Swift, Last Orders pays quietly passionate tribute to the unsung working-class generation that fought World War II and survived to take up apparently humdrum lives."
7441,passion-of-mind-movie,Ella Taylor,20,It's hard to imagine a movie at once more pandering and insulting to adult women
7442,the-return-2004-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"While most films are fortunate if they succeed on any level, The Return works easily on several, making as powerful a mark emotionally as it does visually and even allegorically. Yet the film so catches you up in its compelling story, you're almost not aware of how masterful a piece of cinema you're watching."
7443,neil-young-journeys-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"It certainly stays alive in this spare and intriguing film directed by Jonathan Demme, who has helmed two previous Young concert films."
7444,lullaby-movie,Nick Schager,10,Rarely has the terminal seemed as interminable as it does in Lullaby.
7445,the-boss-baby-movie,John Semley,75,"That the plot is totally stupid is Boss Baby’s saving grace. It’s the rare cartoon that actually feels like a cartoon, propelled by its goofiness and sheer energy and rarely bogged down by boring, polemical lesson-learning."
7446,superman-returns-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,80,"Director Bryan Singer positions this new film as a sequel to Donner's film, and his Superman -- played with winning fortitude by newcomer Brandon Routh -- is less a Man of Steel than a Man of Heart."
7447,summer-catch-movie,Jonathan Foreman,12,Summer Catch is the sludge at the bottom of the barrel.
7448,italian-for-beginners-movie,Steve Simels,30,"None of this is any more fun as it sounds -- the cancer ward scenes are truly disturbing -- but to be fair, writer/director Lone Scherfeg (the first woman to make a Dogme 95 film) manages some black-humored laughs."
7449,virgin-movie,J.R. Jones,80,I was haunted afterward by its seething rage at the malicious paternalism and sexual hypocrisy of fundamentalist Christians.
7450,swiss-army-man-movie,Peter Travers,63,There are times when this mindbending bromance actually achieves a twisted tenderness. There are also times when you'd like to ride Manny's farts to the nearest exit. It's your call.
7451,uncommon-valor-movie,Michael Blowen,0,"With Ted Kotcheff's hackneyed direction and Joe Gayton's cliche-ridden script, this version of ""Missing"" for the soldier of fortune set is one of the most reprehensible exploitation films of the year."
7452,brave-movie,Rene Rodriguez,100,"Brave has a manic, almost daffy energy and sense of humor."
7453,paycheck-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"The story, adapted by Dean Georgaris, doesn't come within a light year of science-fiction plausibility, and after a while Woo gives up trying to sell it and reverts to the action choreography that made him a master of Hong Kong martial-arts movies. "
7454,bad-teacher-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"Diaz, costars Jason Segel and Justin Timberlake, and a sharp supporting cast  manage to deliver a crappy good time, mercifully devoid of any heart-tugging teacher-student subplots."
7455,wild-things-movie,David Denby,30,"Wild Things, which was written by Stephen Peters and directed by John McNaughton, lacks fantasy and flamboyance, that it lacks, precisely, wild things, and that most of it is just flat. "
7456,the-5th-wave-movie,Steve Davis,30,"Given the likely reception to this movie, it’s unlikely there will be a sixth wave anytime soon."
7457,easy-money-movie,Richard Corliss,80,"Well acted and acutely observed, the film doesn't try to be a conventionally satisfying coke-land action film."
7458,stories-we-tell-movie,A.A. Dowd ,91,"Polley’s fledgling foray into documentary filmmaking is also an investigative mystery, a real-life soap opera, and — most compellingly, perhaps — a searching “interrogation” (the director’s word) of the hows and whys of storytelling itself."
7459,2016-obamas-america-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,20,"One could and perhaps should use scare quotes around ""intellectual"" when it comes to someone who would crank out a piece of campaign-season partisan hackwork this crude and sloppy. (By this standard, James Carville looks like Immanuel Kant.) "
7460,barbershop-2-back-in-business-movie,Carla Meyer,75,A warmhearted and surprisingly ambitious sequel.
7461,fist-fight-movie,Peter Debruge,20,A risible excuse for comedy that treats compulsory education as a joke and violence as a reasonable way to solve problems. 
7462,grown-ups-2-movie,Randy Cordova,20,It’s hard to imagine another comedy coming along this year that is this abrasive and free of laughs. It’s like everyone involved intentionally tried to create a horrible movie.
7463,father-figures-movie,Carla Meyer,25,"Wilson and Helms favor Bradshaw in likability. But they are not two hours’ worth of likable, in a film this flawed."
7464,watchmen-movie,Kyle Smith,100,"Director Zack Snyder's cerebral, scintillating follow-up to ""300"" seems, to even a weary filmgoer's eye, as fresh and magnificent in sound and vision as ""2001"" must have seemed in 1968, yet in its eagerness to argue with itself, it resembles ""A Clockwork Orange."""
7465,your-highness-movie,Ty Burr,12,"The most painful movie so far in a year that's already scraping the bottom of the barrel, Your Highness is a tedious, dung-colored misfire that sullies the genre of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" and ""The Princess Bride."""
7466,inside-out-2015-movie,Tasha Robinson,100,"Inside Out has a rich, unpackable story. But like all Pixar’s best films, it’s fleet and accessible, trusting the audience to keep up with an adventure that unfolds at a breakneck pace."
7467,christine-movie,David James,90,"Christine is a fine piece of cinema, not only boasting one of the best performances of the year to date, but also tackling a difficult subject with ample empathy and intelligence."
7468,whitney-movie,Peter Travers,70,"Though Macdonald offers the sight and sound of Whitney in interviews and home movies, she is never heard grappling with the grave issues the film raises. "
7469,wolf-creek-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,12,Just because Dimension considered Greg McLean's nasty exploitation flick worthy of their time and money doesn't mean it deserves yours.
7470,half-past-dead-movie,Marrit Ingman,0,"“This is just like a video game,” observes rapper-cum-actor Ja Rule, taking aim during one of the myriad firefights that comprise this lunkheaded, vaguely dystopic actioner. Man, is it ever."
7471,jersey-boys-movie,Geoff Pevere,38,"It never reaches the soaring, cloud-busting heights of Frankie Valli’s otherworldly falsetto, and it doesn’t even try."
7472,102-dalmatians-movie,Michael Wilmington,38,How is it possible that actors as expert as Close and Depardieu can wind up together in a mostly brainless big-budget stinker?
7473,win-win-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,It's an original that plays as if it were based on a novel.
7474,the-secret-in-their-eyes-movie,Deborah Young,90,A riveting Argentine thriller spiked with witty dialogue and poignant love stories.
7475,happy-gilmore-movie,Joey O'Bryan,11,"A lame, unoriginal comedy."
7476,samson-movie,Inkoo Kang,10,"The film is just plain bad, with an amateur cast (led by Taylor James), cut-rate special effects, who-cares storylines, and confusing details shoehorned in from the Bible. "
7477,dungeons-dragons-movie,Rita Kempley,10,Stinketh like the breath of a dyspeptic dragon.
7478,left-behind-2014-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,12,The film is amateurish on almost every level.
7479,jason-bourne-movie,Robert Abele,95,"This fourth entry after a nine-year break for Damon and Greengrass should represent, for those ready and able to separate popcorn mayhem from the grim realities of world headlines, a bruising and exhilarating ride."
7480,exodus-gods-and-kings-movie,David Ehrlich,20,"I can’t fault Ridley Scott for wanting to stage a version of this saga, just as I can’t ignore the fact that my dad tells the same tale every spring, but much more engagingly, in half the time and drunk on Manischewitz. "
7481,caesar-must-die-movie,Noel Murray,83,"In Caesar Must Die, the characters are both actor and audience, looking at themselves through the lens of a centuries-old fictionalization of history."
7482,eight-crazy-nights-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,"Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike, Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire."
7483,all-about-eve-movie,Able Green,90,"All About Eve has substance in virtually every dramatic and romantic mood, which have been given proper shading and projection by producer Darryl F. Zanuck and Mankiewicz."
7484,pride-prejudice-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"The movie flames to life whenever Donald Sutherland moves into frame as the young ladies' relaxed, humorous, and magnificently rueful father."
7485,dear-frankie-movie,Connie Ogle,75,Dear Frankie is a small movie with a big soul and no easy formula for the happiness of its big-hearted characters.

7487,beloved-2011-movie,Melissa Anderson,30,A sprawling mess of multiple romantic triangles in which all the angles are obtuse. 
7488,the-accountant-movie,Richard Roeper,88,"Madness abounds in The Accountant, an intense, intricate, darkly amusing and action-infused thriller that doesn’t always add up but who cares, it’s BIG FUN."
7489,the-believer-movie,Steve Davis,78,The film's greatest strength undeniably lies in Gosling's revelatory portrayal of Danny.
7490,gods-and-generals-movie,Carrie Rickey,38,"It may not be the worst war epic ever made - that probably would be ""Battlefield Earth"" -- but it's darn close to being an unqualified disaster of that magnitude."
7491,carandiru-movie,Stephen Holden,80,Exudes a throbbing flesh-and-blood intensity so compelling that it's impossible to avert your eyes. 
7492,grown-ups-2-movie,Mark Jenkins,5,"This movie, like all of Sandler's, insists on its star's likability."
7493,the-kid-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,"So rich in processed sugar, canned sentiment and schmaltz, I thought I was going to throw up."
7494,we-own-the-night-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"Adequately acted and flecked with the required quota of action to satisfy genre fans, pic recalls numerous good police dramas of the 1970s, but mostly in superficial ways that bring nothing new to the table."
7495,the-trip-to-italy-movie,Joe Williams,88,"He’s like a globe-trotting Richard Linklater. And with Winterbottom’s first-ever sequel, his “Trip” films now rival ﻿Linklater’s “Before” series in charting how a twosome evolves over time. Plus, they’re bloody hilarious."
7496,gossip-movie,Wesley Morris,12,One of those truly biodegradable experiences.
7497,girlfight-movie,Roger Ebert,88,It's always about more than boxing.
7498,brake-movie,Michael Atkinson,30,"Dorff's mannered Bruce Willis affect seems as insincere as the script, which helplessly loses credibility as info accrues and the narrative unpeels."
7499,believe-me-movie,Josh Kupecki,20,"What is most egregious, and seems completely lost on the filmmakers, is that the film is the very thing it attempts to expose: a pandering cash-in on faith-based films disguising itself as an honest examination of belief. And that, true believers, is unforgivable."
7500,blue-crush-movie,Ron Wells,30,"I'm sure that an interesting film could easily be made about girl surfers, this just ain't it."
7501,bettie-page-reveals-all-movie,Ella Taylor,75,That she continues to invite not just Beyoncé and Katy Perry but millions of adoring men and women along for the ride is icing on the cake.
7502,the-future-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"As she did in her striking 2005 debut, ""Me and You and Everyone We Know,"" July creates a fluid cinematic universe."
7503,the-hills-have-eyes-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"It is not faulty logic that derails The Hills have Eyes, however, but faulty drama. The movie is a one-trick pony."
7504,the-revenant-2015-movie,Roger Moore,100,"A riveting saga of pain, grit and the brute moral relativism of revenge, the first law of all, and the only one that mattered back then. The Revenant is one of the best pictures of the year."
7505,drop-dead-gorgeous-movie,John Hartl,10,"Broad, obvious and thuddingly unfunny, Drop Dead Gorgeous makes almost every previous ""mockumentary"" look like a work of genius."
7506,secretary-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"It provokes nothing but yawns, and the sex it explores is stuff everybody knows about and says, ""So what?"""
7507,the-honeymooners-movie,Mark Holcomb,30,"John Schultz's wan, unfunny The Honeymooners is unlikely to tickle devotees of Jackie Gleason's archetypal yuk-fest."
7508,gullivers-travels-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,0,"Listless, dull, and totally lacking in spectacle."
7509,taking-lives-movie,Marrit Ingman,20,A twist ending in search of its movie.
7510,the-ridiculous-6-movie,Brian Tallerico,12,"The film has no flow, no rhythm, and absolutely no reason to be 119 minutes. And then there’s the broad racism and misogyny of the piece."
7511,jack-the-giant-slayer-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,"By the end, I was adding my own internal ""Deadwood""-style profanities to McShane's clean dialogue. ""For the sake of the (God-@#$%) kingdom, cut it (the @#$%) down!"" Movies about mile-high beanstalks shouldn't require additional audience imagination."
7512,tabu-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,100,"If you have the patience to watch this film develop and unfold, like some bizarre night-blooming orchid, what you'll see is not just the last movie released in 2012, but possibly the most original of them all."
7513,breaking-in-movie,Vince Mancini,25,Even on a technical level Breaking In is shockingly inept.
7514,the-bye-bye-man-movie,David Fear,12,"Horror-movie fans often have put up with a lot to get their requisite amount of fright per month, and that tolerance limit is seriously tested by this slapdash attempt to introduce a new slasher hall-of-fame character into the mix."
7515,much-ado-about-nothing-movie,Steve Persall,83,"Much Ado About Nothing is simply a fun time among Whedon and his friends, and for the most part it's contagious."

7517,wild-hogs-movie,Ruthe Stein,0,Hogwash and not even funny hogwash.
7518,the-pianist-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,One of the great Holocaust films.
7519,enchanted-movie,Wesley Morris,75,The sight of Adams gliding and beaming and chirping in this movie - a self-mocking cartoon that transforms into an inspired live-action musical farce - is just about the happiest time I've had watching an actor do anything all year.
7520,the-deep-end-of-the-ocean-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"It has the overwhelming stench of a film afflicted by star ego -- Michelle Pfeiffer is never wrong, which is exactly what is wrong with The Deep End of the Ocean."
7521,risen-movie,Eric Henderson,12,It's an episode of Without a Trace: Jerusalem presented with all the panache of a Trinity Broadcasting Network TV special.
7522,the-trust-movie,Chuck Bowen,63,"Throughout Alex and Benjamin Brewer's film, Nicolas Cage holds the screen with his distinct timing and expressive force of being."
7523,leap-year-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,30,"If only Leap Year were an anomaly, the kind of picture that comes along only once every four years. Instead, it's yet more evidence that romantic comedies are only getting worse."
7524,warm-bodies-movie,Liam Lacey,63,"Warm Bodies is for audiences who prefer stories about mending hearts to munching brains, and ideally, for girls who aren't quite sure yet if they want a slightly scary boyfriend, or a living doll they can dress up."
7525,antz-movie,David Sterritt,100,Pure fun.
7526,happy-tears-movie,Melissa Anderson,0,"Continuing both his bad filmmaking and obsession with lethal orifices, Mitchell Lichtenstein follows up ""Teeth,"" his clumsy debut about a dismembering vagina, with a voluminous explosion of poop."
7527,book-club-movie,Ann Hornaday,75,"It has brio, rueful humor and celebratory verve that is nearly impossible to resist."
7528,no-good-deed-2014-movie,Josh Kupecki,11,"No Good Deed slouches toward its inevitable conclusion much like that rough beast to Bethlehem, falling apart and lacking all conviction."
7529,final-destination-3-movie,Peter Rainer,0,"There's nothing fresh or off-beat in Final Destination 3, no talent that is struggling to get out. The only thing struggling to get out was me from the theater."
7530,transformers-the-last-knight-movie,Peter Travers,0,"Transformers: The Last Knight is all kinds of awful. It's also the worst of the series to date, which is saying something."
7531,the-skin-that-i-live-in-movie,Alison Willmore,75,"Aside from his usual bold color schemes, Almodóvar has managed a remarkably restrained telling of what's in essence a sci-fi psychosexual melodrama set in the very near future of 2012 Toledo."
7532,walk-the-line-movie,J.R. Jones,80,"As the star-crossed couple, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon contribute all their own vocals, and their soapier scenes together reminded me of no less than the 1954 ""A Star Is Born."""
7533,the-three-stooges-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"It's just not enough to say that The Three Stooges is the death of comedy. Rather, it's the death, burial, putrefaction and decomposition of comedy. It is where comedy, once alive, ends up as dust blowing in the wind, like something out of a really bad Kansas song."
7534,legends-of-the-fall-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"Legends of the Fall is a magnificent bore: a western saga lolling in its own immensity - its big music, its big scenery and, yes, its big hair"
7535,the-final-project-movie,Rob Staeger,10,"Slipshod in every way, The Final Project can't even be bothered to show the important stuff."
7536,man-down-movie,Brian Tallerico,25,"Man Down is a bad film, but it’s made even worse by the taste it will leave in your mouth regarding its silly handling of a very serious issue."
7537,two-for-the-money-movie,Steven Rea,63,"It says in the beginning of the film that Two for the Money is ""inspired by a true story."" Problem is, it's just not that inspired."
7538,the-duff-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,33,"Director Ari Sandel, working with a script by Josh A. Cagan, doesn't have the deftness to really convey how Bianca's personality turns conventional wisdom into her own unique, attractive qualities."
7539,the-bands-visit-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"The Band’s Visit has not provided any of the narrative payoffs we might have expected, but has provided something more valuable: An interlude involving two “enemies,” Arabs and Israelis, that shows them both as only ordinary people with ordinary hopes, lives and disappointments. It has also shown us two souls with rare beauty."
7540,harry-+-max-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,The most shocking thing about Harry and Max isn't the subject matter. The most shocking thing is just how tepid it is.
7541,charlies-angels-full-throttle-movie,Glenn Kenny,12,"As for me, watching this overripe, ignorant parading of Hollywood privilege an hubris put me in mind of a different song--Neil Young's ""Revolution Blues."" Specifically the bit about Laurel Canyon being filled with famous stars . . ."
7542,brothers-keeper-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Brother's Keeper, the year's best documentary, has an impact and immediacy that most fiction films can only envy. It tells a strong story, and some passages are truly inspirational, as the neighbors of Munnsville become determined that Delbert will not be railroaded by some ambitious prosecutor more concerned with bringing charges than with understanding the reality of the situation."
7543,silence-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Still, when you’re making a Christian epic and the best thing about it is the guy playing the inquisitor, you have a serious problem. "
7544,four-lions-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"The only reason to see it is Riz Ahmed's performance as Omar, the supposed brains of the operation. Mr. Ahmed reminded me a bit of Robert Carlyle. He's dynamic, quick-tongued and intense. And much too classy for this tatty room."
7545,2016-obamas-america-movie,Phil Contrino,30,"Even if 2016 is preaching to the choir, its fanbase is eager to tithe - it's spent this week as Fandango's #1 ticket seller."
7546,friday-night-lights-movie,David Ansen,90,Few films have shown so powerfully the slashing double edge of sports fever.
7547,the-cat-in-the-hat-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"An abomination, impure and simple."
7548,the-divergent-series-insurgent-movie,Amy Nicholson,10,Insurgent is so vapid it seems impossible that there's enough story left for another sequel.
7549,the-mummy-2017-movie,David Edelstein,0,The Mummy is not your usual lousy movie. It has been made with skill and hits its marks. But those marks are so low and so brazenly mercenary that it doesn’t feel like much of an achievement. It’s not involving. 
7550,kingsman-the-golden-circle-movie,Jake Cole,38,The hollow grandeur of the film's action only gives the proceedings a glib undertone that also undermines the rare occasions of earnestness that the heroes exhibit toward fallen comrades.
7551,american-hardcore-movie,Gregory Kirshling,75,"Illuminating nostalgia, stuffed with all the right tattooed talking heads (like Black Flag's Henry Rollins), plus grim-looking concert footage of wailing skinny guys."
7552,rush-hour-3-movie,Scott Schueller,25,Rush Hour 3 is DOA.
7553,get-out-movie,Matt Singer,80,It does what all great horror movies do: turn real-world anxieties into the stuff of nightmares.
7554,two-girls-and-a-guy-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,90,"You'll likely come away from this astonishing encounter between the three corners of a lovers' triangle not just amused but enlightened about such not-so-simple issues as fidelity, betrayal, lust, possessiveness, honesty and forgiveness. "
7555,the-campaign-2012-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"Because The Campaign tries to say something about truth vs. hogwash in election season, it's doubly sad the efforts of screenwriters Chris Henchy and Shawn Harwell come to so little. "
7556,caves-of-forgotten-dreams-movie,Roger Moore,88,"If you're looking for a filmmaker to document, for all of humanity, ""one of the greatest discoveries in the history of human culture,"" the great Werner Herzog is your guy."
7557,the-breadwinner-movie,Danielle White,67,"While it is more of a kids’ story, Anita Doron’s screenplay contains layers and subtleties that adults are sure to appreciate."
7558,the-bridges-of-madison-county-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"A beautiful film, not only in the way it was photographed, but for the manner through which the characters are revealed to us."
7559,anatomy-of-hell-movie,Keith Phipps,30,"Even without the difficult imagery, Breillat's grim observations on men, women, and sexual orientation, are tough to take. "
7560,finders-keepers-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,90,"Revealing its humanity slowly and a little tardily, Finders Keepers finally does justice to its dueling antiheroes."
7561,intolerable-cruelty-movie,Peter Travers,75,"Near the end of this smart, speedy romantic farce, the comic engine hits a wall and sputters. Until then, this Coen brothers film -- easily their silliest -- is fueled by a screwball fizz that keeps the laughs popping. "
7562,the-strangers-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"A horror film with a moral. No matter how nasty a gang of murderers is, the moviemaker calling the shots is ultimately worse."
7563,two-days-one-night-movie,Peter Bradshaw,100,A tense dramatic situation and a subtly magnificent central performance from Marion Cotillard add up to an outstanding new movie from the Dardenne brothers.
7564,amelia-movie,Claudia Puig,63,Amelia goes airborne but never fully soars.
7565,cold-comfort-farm-movie,Desson Thomson,80,"Thanks to Schlesinger's exacting direction and Malcolm Bradbury's witty, restrained script, these characters are kept more amusing than horribly pitiable."
7566,gotti-movie,Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,16,"When the film isn’t simply boring, it becomes unintentionally hilarious in its occasionally inept production."
7567,mea-maxima-culpa-silence-in-the-house-of-god-movie,Mark Jenkins,85,"The movie revisits the themes (and some of the same characters) of Amy Berg's chilling 2006 chronicle ""Deliver Us from Evil."" But it reaches further, expanding from one American diocese to Ireland, Italy, the Vatican and the career of the current pope."
7568,big-daddy-movie,Edward Guthmann,0,"Nasty to women, cruel to old people and tosses in a cardboard gay couple for gratuitous laughs. It's also got one of those annoying soundtracks that lays rock music right over the dialogue -- as if it wanted to distract us from it."
7569,hotel-transylvania-2-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,38,"If this all sounds rather dull, that is because it is."
7570,the-death-of-stalin-movie,Jake Cole,63,Armando Iannucci satirizes the manner in which political power is accorded to those who can mask cutthroat ambition behind an outward projection of bland inoffensiveness.
7571,the-princess-diaries-2-royal-engagement-movie,Ty Burr,38,So unfocused is Shonda Rhimes's screenplay and so flabby is Marshall's direction. 
7572,camp-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Camp has also been compared to Alan Parker’s ""Fame,"" which operates with a similar love of behind-the-scenes melodrama and youthful idealism, but different in that it doesn’t induce brain-swelling revulsion in the viewer."
7573,the-big-short-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"With its cartoonish pace, larger-than-life characters and detours into farce and agitprop, this movie captures the accelerated pace of life in the financial markets and the vast scale of their mendacity far more vividly than a naturalistic drama could."
7574,the-selfish-giant-movie,Mark Jenkins,90,"As Arbor, nonprofessional actor Chapman gives one of the fiercest performances of this kind since Martin Compston's turn as a different sort of teenage entrepreneur in Loach's 2002 film ""Sweet Sixteen."" He's riveting, even in his final moment of calm."
7575,this-is-not-a-film-movie,A.O. Scott,100,"How did Mr. Panahi do this? I'm at a bit of a loss to explain, to tell you the truth, since my job is to review movies, and this, obviously, is something different: a masterpiece in a form that does not yet exist. "
7576,big-fan-movie,Marc Mohan,83,Oswalt sells Auferio's pasty indecision and makes him a more sympathetic figure than he has any right to be.
7577,movement-and-location-movie,Chuck Wilson,70,"Despite its sci-fi hook, Movement and Location turns out to be a surprisingly resonant film about how impossible it is for most people — no matter their cosmic time zone — to carve out a life that's emotionally honest."
7578,mother!-movie,Peter Bradshaw,100,"As horror it is ridiculous, as comedy it is startling and hilarious, and as a machine for freaking you out it is a thing of wonder."
7579,planet-of-the-apes-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"My Homo sapiens brain was boggled by the movie's clumsiness, while my heart was chilled by the chance that otherwise mature members of my species might mistake this disjointed botch for summer entertainment."
7580,rams-movie,Joe McGovern,91,The film’s glacial pacing and drily absurd tone mimic their relationship with a bit too much discipline.
7581,mr-3000-movie,Anita Gates,70,"If there was any question about how well Bernie Mac's charm, demonstrated in stand-up comedy and on his Fox sitcom, would play on the big screen, the news is good: no problem."
7582,ronin-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,It's a welcome throwback to the days when the world didn't have to end or tanker trucks explode to get an action audience's attention.
7583,basic-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"I must confess that I was outsmarted by the ending, but by that time my brain had been bludgeoned into a state just north of stupor."
7584,girl-on-a-bicycle-movie,John DeFore,30,A rom-com whose agreeable individual elements aren't enough to sell the witless contrivance around which they revolve.
7585,tokyo!-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"Do these films reflect actual aspects of modern Tokyo? The hikikomori epidemic is apparently real enough, but the other two segments seem more deliberately fantastical. The entertainment value? Medium to high: ""Merde."" Tokyo? Still standing."
7586,the-life-aquatic-with-steve-zissou-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"As someone who has warmed up to Anderson's work only gradually, I'd call this a step back for him, but I also can't help but wonder: Will he ever take that crucial step forward and stop saying, Isn't it ironic?"
7587,tropic-thunder-movie,Peter Hartlaub,100,The movie is laugh-until-your-stomach-hurts hilarious.
7588,bopha!-movie,Jay Carr,88,"In Bopha! the usual apartheid-struggle elements never thin out into abstractions. They're elemental, encapsulating a country's tragedy resonantly and powerfully in a single family's. [24 Sept 1993, p.51]"
7589,better-living-movie,Maitland McDonagh,30,"It's all terribly schematic, thematically obvious and not in the least bit funny."
7590,xanadu-movie,David Ansen,10,"Michael Beck (of ""The Warriors"") shows no discernible talent for musical romanticism Olivia (""Totally Hot"") Newton-John sings prettily but is totally tepid, and the ever graceful Gene Kelly deserves a medal for keeping a straight face. Robert Greenwald, the director, should look into another line of work. Perhaps opening a disco? [18 Aug 1980, p.85]"
7591,the-minus-man-movie,Christopher Brandon,10,Really a big fat zero.  Hampton Fancher has done the unthinkable -- he's made a boring serial killer movie.
7592,the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-2-movie,Alonso Duralde,90,This is a film that dares to be about something while still delivering as a piece of straightforward entertainment.
7593,petes-dragon-movie,Russ Fischer,85,David Lowery‘s ease with actors and command of tone make Pete’s Dragon one of the best remakes in recent years.
7594,urban-legend-movie,Bob Heisler,30,"A low-voltage drive-in movie, made strictly by the book."
7595,i-tonya-movie,Rex Reed,100,"This remarkable movie — factual and funny, always surprising and unconventionally written, directed and acted — sets the record straight with an adrenalin rush that overwhelms the senses."
7596,gauguin-voyage-to-tahiti-movie,Pat Brown,38,"Gauguin represents for the film no less an ideal Romantic subject than the Polynesians represented for the painter himself: penniless, chronically ill, and living in self-imposed isolation—the very embodiment of the suffering artist. "
7597,justice-league-movie,Robbie Collin,20,"It feels like a sheepish feature-length retraction of the franchise to date. It’s consistently embarrassing to watch, and features plot holes so yawningly vast they have a kind of Grand Canyon-like splendour: part of you wants to hang around to see what they look like at sunset."
7598,left-behind-2014-movie,Steve Macfarlane,12,"Left Behind is one of those films so deeply, fundamentally terrible that it feels unwittingly high-concept."
7599,the-brothers-grimsby-movie,Drew McWeeny,0,An entirely laughless affair and easily the low point of Cohen's career so far.
7600,the-last-airbender-movie,A.O. Scott,20,The problem -- the catastrophe -- of The Last Airbender is not in the conception but the execution. The long-winded explanations and clumsy performances are made worse by graceless effects and a last-minute 3-D conversion that wrecks whatever visual grace or beauty might have been there.
7601,jaws-the-revenge-movie,Staff (Not Credited),20,"Pacing leaves a lot to be desired and the moment-of-attack sequences, full of jagged cuts and a great deal of noise, more closely resemble the view from inside a washing machine."
7602,eight-crazy-nights-movie,Nathan Rabin,20,"The worst Hanukkah movie ever made, Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights does for the holiday what ""Santa Claus: The Movie"" did for Christmas."
7603,the-wrestler-movie,Dan Jolin,100,"An emotional smackdown. Rourke's never been better, and the change of pace and texture suits Aronofsky perfectly. ""The Raging Bull"" of wrestling movies? Oh, go on then."
7604,of-gods-and-men-movie,A.O. Scott,100,"Of Gods and Men is supple and suspenseful, appropriately austere without being overly harsh, and without forgoing the customary pleasures of cinema. The performances are strong, the narrative gathers momentum as it progresses, and the camera is alive to the beauty of the Algerian countryside. "
7605,the-majestic-movie,David Denby,20,"Carrey, unable to pretzel himself in this role, has to do a normal job of characterization, but he never fills in the blank spaces in Peter Appleton.  [28 Jan 2002, p. 90]"
7606,boat-trip-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"A smutty, imbecilic farce. "
7607,jeepers-creepers-ii-movie,Gene Seymour,30,"Where the first ""Jeepers Creepers"" came across like a dark, wacky dream, the inevitable Jeepers Creepers 2 seems more like a franchise under construction. "
7608,priceless-movie,Desson Thomson,80,"Tautou is a delight, as always, using her bubbly personality to comic advantage. And Elmaleh makes for a sort of poor man's Buster Keaton, perpetually stressed but refusing to surrender, no matter how much damage he sustains to himself or his wallet."
7609,elephant-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,"The characters need more exploration, especially the killers. Yet this look at teen life and death chills you anyway."
7610,crash-1997-movie,Edward Guthmann,75,"I'm not quite sure what David Cronenberg is trying to say in Crash, but whatever it is, he deserves a lot of credit for having the nerve to put it on screen and face the consequences."
7611,play-it-to-the-bone-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,Doesn't quite have the goods.
7612,wallace-gromit-the-curse-of-the-were-rabbit-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,100,"Bestows generous blessings on all that's good in Englishness, in moviedom, and, of course, in cheese."
7613,all-the-real-girls-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,80,"Green treats his people with affectionate knowledge, untinged with patronizing. And he sees them in ways that are free of cinematic cliché."
7614,midnight-special-movie,Chris Nashawaty,91,"As father and son speed toward some doomsday reckoning, Nichols keeps us guessing in a way that evokes ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Midnight Special is a more modest, more enigmatic film than that one was, but it’s no less gripping."
7615,mafioso-re-release-movie,Wesley Morris,88,Mafioso is the missing link in the mob movie arc.
7616,major-payne-movie,Liam Lacey,12,"Wayanswill do anything for a laugh, and twice if necessary. If Carrey wears abroken front tooth in Dumb and Dumber, Wayans has two front teeth cappedwith gold. If Carrey sells a dead bird to a blind child, Wayans shaves theheads of a blind boy and his seeing-eye dog. [24 March 1995]"
7617,collateral-damage-movie,David Edelstein,30,"It's another dumb vengeance picture -- ""In the Bedroom"" for meatheads."
7618,the-memory-of-a-killer-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,"Wonderfully acted and energetically filmed, and in fact it partly echoes a real-life pedophilia scandal that rocked Belgian society to its foundations in the '90s."
7619,the-replacements-movie,Marc Caro,25,This is the laziest kind of filmmaking.
7620,battleship-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,The worst humans-fighting-aliens movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of humans-fighting-aliens movies.
7621,the-last-five-years-movie,Bob Mondello,80,"Kendrick qualifies as the movie's secret weapon — actually not so secret now that she's charmed audiences in both Into the Woods and Pitch Perfect. She's so appealing here, in fact, that audience sympathies are likely to be less-than-evenly split between the two leads."
7622,whiplash-movie,Ty Burr,100,"At Sundance, Whiplash quickly picked up the nickname “Full Metal Juilliard” on the basis of scenes in which Andrew, plucked from a late-night practice session to be the orchestra’s drummer, is raked over the coals by his new mentor. Horrifying as they are, these sequences are dazzling exercises in total humiliation."
7623,melancholia-movie,J. Hoberman,90,"Plenty of moments in Melancholia are painfully funny. Some moments are even painful to watch, but there was never a moment when I thought about the time or my next movie or did not care about the characters or had anything less than complete interest in what was happening on the screen. "
7624,the-godfather-part-iii-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"It's hard to tell if this thing's serious or parody and, if it is parody, whether or not it's intentional. Is it a winky joke, for instance, to have lightweight performer George Hamilton as Pacino's business attorney, or just ridiculous casting? Hamilton's performance points to the latter."
7625,dodgeball-a-true-underdog-story-movie,David Hiltbrand,38,"Anyone with a sizable role in Dodgeball gets mired in the script's dissipated tone. Two of the climactic jokes involve ""Happy Days"" references. How tenuous is that? "
7626,bats-movie,Lawrence Van Gelder,20,Cause for fright in only one respect: the possibility that it could spawn sequels.
7627,the-tortured-1969-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,10,"Veering from ridiculous to revolting, The Tortured would like to be about more than singed nipples and seared skin. And it is: It's also about cracked toes and lanced eardrums."
7628,the-women-movie,Anthony Lane,10,The funniest thing about The Women is that Mick Jagger is one of the producers.
7629,the-princess-bride-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,80,"Not even the crude ethnic humor--Billy Crystal's Mel Brooks-ish Miracle Max--pricks the dream bubble, and the spirited cast has a field day."
7630,sabans-power-rangers-movie,Justin Chang,20,"I feel more qualified than usual to announce that Saban’s Power Rangers (Saban clearly never learned to share) is a witless and cobbled-together pile of junk, and I mean that not as an insult so much as an assurance of brand integrity. "
7631,greenfingers-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,33,"If your allergy to comedies bred from British style mugging crossed with Disney style prancing has, like mine, flared up in recent years, this hybrid from writer director Joel Hershman (''Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me'') will make you wheeze."
7632,ghostbusters-2016-movie,Calvin Wilson,88,This reboot starring some of today’s finest comic actors — male or female — is a wonderfully hilarious and boldly imaginative creation in its own right.
7633,ghostbusters-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Ghostbusters is one of those rare movies where the original, fragile comic vision has survived a multimillion-dollar production."
7634,stardom-movie,Stephen Hunter,0,"Tells us nothing we didn't already know, and it tells it over and over and over."
7635,cabin-boy-movie,Chris Willman,30,"The problem is that it doesn't find a lot of laughs in much of anything, referential or otherwise. [7 Jan 1994]"
7636,about-schmidt-movie,David Ansen,100,"This powerfully contained, painfully funny performance has to rank with the greatest work Nicholson's ever done -- This road movie gives you emotional whiplash, and you’ll be glad you went along for the ride."
7637,loser-movie,Sean Means,10,Gets my vote for the summer's most offensive movie.
7638,the-book-thief-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"A misfire in far too many meaningful aspects, The Book Thief is so bad that it's tough to decide whether it's better used as a sleep aid or watched while under the influence as an object of derision. "
7639,little-fockers-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Little Fockers may not be the worst, most vulgar, most pathetic and least funny picture of the year. But it's a strong contender for second place behind the picture Brett Favre allegedly sent over his cellphone."
7640,over-her-dead-body-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,0,"May be the worst romantic comedy I've ever seen, although I hesitate to make such a resolute pronouncement about a movie that's so barely even THERE."
7641,raw-movie,Katie Rife,91,"The film gained an unfortunate reputation as a gross-out cannibal shocker on the festival circuit, and while that categorization is not entirely, technically incorrect — this is a piece of body horror, and an intensely visceral one — it detracts from the striking imagery and layered symbolism of Ducournau’s uncommonly assured debut feature. "
7642,o-brother-where-art-thou-movie,Robert Wilonsky,90,"Clooney has become a movie star, and the Coens have given him his very own ""It Happened One Night."" The man, and the movie, are downright bona fide."
7643,american-honey-movie,David Rooney,70,"The film works best as a poignant character study, observing Star as she settles into her independence and figures out who she wants to be, framed by a vast physical landscape that stretches socioeconomically from privileged wealth to squalid poverty. There's a wonderful intimacy in the way Arnold examines young women in her films."
7644,resident-evil-afterlife-movie,Ethan Gilsdorf,25,"So nonchalant is Resident Evil: Afterlife, the fourth movie in Paul W.S. Anderson's dystopian franchise, that its overarching premise isn't explained."
7645,wonder-boys-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"An often-wondrous comedy, just as rich and surprising as ""L.A. Confidential"" but considerably less dark."
7646,are-we-there-yet-movie,Wesley Morris,25,This gnarly and illogical little sitcom is bound to make any adult reconsider that next outing with the kids.
7647,sweet-november-movie,Robert Horton,30,"Charlize Theron has charm and skill, but no actress could survive this role, which has the gravity and verisimilitude of a sketch from a late-sixties Nancy Sinatra TV special."
7648,dreamgirls-movie,Carrie Rickey,88,"Bill Condon's screen adaptation of the 1981 Broadway sensation is, if possible, as dazzling and energizing as its source."
7649,sexy-beast-movie,David Edelstein,90,"The movie is riotously entertaining, and with a big heart, too."
7650,the-fighting-temptations-movie,Mike Clark,38,"If Gooding can't get another ""Boyz N the Hood"" or ""Jerry Maguire"" soon, his career will need its own cork. "
7651,waiting-for-guffman-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"May be amusing if you feel a pressing need to feel superior to somebody, but the aim is too broad and scattershot to add up to much beyond an acknowledgment of small-town desperation--something Sherwood Anderson and Sinclair Lewis did much better back in the 20s and 30s."
7652,jackass-presents-bad-grandpa-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,12,"A choppy, feature-length progression of crude, predictable gags, the film plays like a variety show, and yet its main attraction is barely funny enough to warrant his own brief sketch."
7653,2-fast-2-furious-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Certainly trashy, but, stripped of Mr. Diesel's services and directed by John Singleton, it's a no-go Yugo in muscle-car sheet metal."
7654,in-darkness-movie,Jaime N. Christley,12,"It's the rare film that should not introduce new story elements or characters past its first act. In Darkness, a garbage movie applying for unlimited credit on the most meager collateral, is that film."
7655,going-in-style-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"The geezer humor is just as funny here as it was in the original version of this film, which starred George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg. I mean this as a compliment, although it’s, admittedly, a bit backhanded."
7656,mortdecai-movie,Stephen Dalton,20,Mortdecai is an anachronistic mess that never succeeds in re-creating the breezy tone or snappy rhythm of the classic caper movies that it aims to pastiche.
7657,saints-and-soldiers-movie,Robert Dominguez,75,"In his feature film debut, Little uses washed-out color and a you-are-there immediacy to tell a powerful wartime tale of survival, morality and honor."
7658,made-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"Some of the dialogue in Made was improvised, and the comic invention at work here -- Vaughn's and Favreau's -- make Made into a rough gem."
7659,under-the-skin-movie,Liam Lacey,63,"All this is initially fascinating, and then progressively less so. The problem is the usual serial-killer issue – things, no matter how weird and kinky, get repetitive."
7660,panic-movie,A.O. Scott,80,A sneaky and smart film noir.
7661,the-circle-movie,Jonathan Foreman,63,"This film is fighting the good fight, albeit in a rather heavy-handed way."
7662,anomalisa-movie,Eric Kohn,91,"A disorienting puzzle of a movie with many exhilarating pieces, Anomalisa nevertheless maintains a straightforward trajectory involving Michael's internal strife."
7663,the-emoji-movie-movie,Bilge Ebiri,10,"The film is boldly bad, yes, but also boldly boring."
7664,war-machine-movie,Richard Roeper,88,"It’s deliberately over the top, and I wouldn’t be surprised if some observers say Pitt made huge miscalculations in his acting choices with the result being the worst performance of his career — but I found it to be a brazenly effective piece of work, well-suited to the material."
7665,me-before-you-movie,Julia Cooper,25,"Despite its $20-million budget, Me Before You is cheap; and just like a person who has more money than he knows what to do with, this film equates wealth with value and vulnerability with death."
7666,the-town-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,91,"A rich, dark, pulpy mess of entanglements that fulfills all the requirements of the genre, and is told with an ease and gusto that make the pulp tasty."
7667,harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets-movie,J.R. Jones,80,Columbus beautifully realizes many of Rowling's fantastic conceits -- but for the last hour I was searching for a spell to make the credits appear.
7668,and-so-it-goes-movie,Scott Foundas,30,"For all of its 93 minutes, you never feel anything significant is at stake for anyone — save for a paycheck."
7669,terminal-movie,Jake Cole,25,"Terminal's actors are awkward and stiff in trying to project hard-boiled cool, and all while delivering lines that sound as if they had been passed multiple times through an online translation tool."
7670,kingsman-the-secret-service-movie,Rex Reed,25,"Expensive, derivative and boring as mattress ticking masquerading as designer fabric."
7671,phantoms-movie,Ty Burr,16,"It's nearly unwatchable, a farrago of confusing direction, stupid plot coincidences, and banal dialogue."
7672,psycho-1960-movie,Mark Monahan,100,"Hitchcock's mischievous genius for audience manipulation is everywhere: in the noirish angularity of the cinematography, in his use of Bernard Herrmann's stabbing string score, in the ornithological imagery that creates a bizarre sense of preying and being preyed upon."
7673,your-highness-movie,Richard Corliss,10,"Occasionally curious moviegoers will discover an especially rotten specimen of the genus Cinema stinkibus... a work of ur-awfulness, counterbrilliance and antigenius. Your Highness, the new medieval-fantasy farce starring and co-written by Danny McBride, is such a movie."
7674,the-longest-yard-1974-movie,Rob LeDonne,75,"This Burt Reynolds offering is a look at both prison life and the sport, and offers two hallmarks of classic 70's cinema: gritty, no holds barred action – and Reynolds' chest hair."
7675,sucker-punch-movie,Steve Persall,0,"It's all megalomaniacal junk from Snyder, but that isn't his most offensive move."
7676,paranoia-movie,Steve Macfarlane,38,Robert Luketic's supposedly down-and-dirty corporate espionage thriller undercuts itself at nearly every turn by shunning any potential relevancy.
7677,boo!-a-madea-halloween-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"The film is chockablock with terrible actors (including Tyga, in a bizarro cameo rapping at a frat party), and the jokes he gives his inferior cast to work with are stinkers."
7678,sin-city-a-dame-to-kill-for-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,"It’s so egregiously awful, so utterly without merit, that it makes its predecessor seem much worse by association. The film’s brainless, chest-beating brand of hyper-pulp calls into question whether Sin City was any good at all, or whether the novelty of its visuals and storytelling merely masked a howling nothingness at its core. "
7679,inside-man-movie,J.R. Jones,90,A superior nail-biter.
7680,whip-it-movie,Michael Sragow,63,"The movie ended just in time. Any more of it, and I'd have been crying uncle. Or maybe, given the grrrl-power of it all, crying aunt. This is one supposedly contrarian film that rouses the counter-contrarian in you."
7681,the-divide-movie,Sara Stewart,12,The only possible relief from director Xavier Gens' abusively bleak survivalist scenario is how implausible it is.
7682,black-sea-movie,Claudia Puig,75,"Claustrophobic, compelling and suspenseful."
7683,guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"Gunn makes this huge entertainment accessible to the converted and the neophyte alike, and he has only has one goal: To send you out of the theater with a fat smile on your face. Mission accomplished."
7684,the-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-movie,Keith Phipps,67,"Mostly The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel stays focused on the cutesy, low-stakes personal journeys of its English characters, characters it would be hard to care about if they weren't brought to life by actors who give the film substance and gravity it doesn't otherwise know how to earn. "
7685,leap-year-movie,Staff (Not credited),12,A retread of just about every rom-com cliche ever turned.
7686,stealing-harvard-movie,Rick Groen,38,"A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious. There's talent in this picture, both before and behind the camera, but virtually none of it gets on the screen."
7687,el-cantante-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,The film doesn't make a case for Lavoe as an important artist.
7688,the-legend-of-drunken-master-movie,Joe Leydon,80,"Well positioned to slake the thirst of action fans for world-class, slam-bang rough stuff."
7689,red-dawn-movie,Bilge Ebiri,10,"Love it or hate it, Milius's original Red Dawn looks like an Akira Kurosawa masterpiece next to this latest iteration, directed by Dan Bradley. "
7690,blindspotting-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"The best films teach you how to watch them within the first few minutes. Blindspotting is no exception. The film gets off to an exhilarating start, with split-screen images of Oakland, Calif., unspooling to the tune of a soaring aria."
7691,first-daughter-movie,Robert Koehler,30,"There are stiff politicians and there are stiff political movies, but the rigidity of the White House-based fairy tale that is First Daughter is in a category even pollsters may have a hard time assessing."
7692,gothika-movie,Sean Axmaker,75,Kassovitz directs with an unrelenting intensity that helps you to suspend disbelief almost all the way to the credits.
7693,hush-movie,Liam Lacey,38,[Lange] does give the movie the only excitement it possesses -- the frisson of a hideous thrill -- but it's still an excruciating embarrassment.
7694,the-hurt-locker-movie,Calvin Wilson,100,At once an unforgettable war film and a brilliant character study.
7695,in-the-land-of-blood-and-honey-movie,Eric Kohn,83,The most impressive thing about In the Land of Blood and Honey is that Jolie makes you feel it.
7696,for-greater-glory-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,30,Only Ruben Blades as President Calles and Bruce Greenwood as American Ambassador Dwight Morrow get out of this film with their acting dignity intact. 
7697,the-decline-of-western-civilization-part-iii-movie,Hannah Brown,100,"Those with the stomach to sit through Decline will be rewarded with a lively, masterful documentary."
7698,the-selfish-giant-movie,Peter Bradshaw,80,"This is a fine film, which cements Barnard's growing reputation as one of Britain's best film-makers."
7699,the-big-risk-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,100,"A doozy of a French gangster pic that, in its beautifully refurbished and pithily resubtitled re-release, turns out to be one of the highlights of the 2005 movie year."
7700,the-salt-of-the-earth-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"Is what we see grief porn or an epic, careerlong study in the best and worst we can find on Earth? See the film and decide for yourself."
7701,real-women-have-curves-movie,Ty Burr,88,"I have seen the future of Hollywood movie stardom, and its name is America Ferrera."
7702,transformers-the-last-knight-movie,Oliver Jones,0,"A sloppy, stupid, and — evidenced by other casual misappropriations of history at its darkest (Frederick Douglass was also part of this Transformers secret society but apparently couldn’t convince them to do anything about slavery)— quite possibly evil movie."
7703,the-strangers-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,80,"A spare, creepily atmospheric psychological thriller with a death grip on the psychological aspect."
7704,the-disappearance-of-eleanor-rigby-them-movie,Inkoo Kang,30,"I was tempted to remark that Benson doesn't know how to write women, until I noticed that he doesn't know how to write men, either."
7705,the-real-cancun-movie,Staff (Not credited),10,"Two of MTV's stupidest programs, ""The Real World"" and ""Spring Break,"" have been rolled into one staggeringly dumb feature film."
7706,raising-victor-vargas-movie,Ty Burr,88,"The ''R'' rating is understandable, but absurd. This is a family film in the most complicated and, ultimately, most cheering sense. "
7707,deepwater-horizon-movie,Bryan Bishop,65,"There’s no question that Deepwater Horizon delivers thrills, but you may feel awfully empty afterward."
7708,sinister-2012-movie,James Rocchi,20,"Sinister is pretty much everything to hate about modern horror in one mixed bag, a ramshackle teardown of jump-scares and creaky tricks, saw-it-coming ""surprises"" and the lead-footed thud of inevitability as it tediously places one clumsy foot in front of the other, plodding towards a finale that comes far too late. "
7709,ramona-and-beezus-movie,Mary Pols,70,"A gentle, charming movie and really a parent's dream: a kid's movie that doesn't involve action sequences or explosions. Yet you wish the filmmakers had adhered to Mr. Quimby's no-nonsense point of view and found a way to make this family slightly less squeaky-clean. "
7710,30-beats-movie,Joe Williams,38,"Where the original play ""La Ronde"" was a social satire about the transmission of venereal disease, 30 Beats is a sickly stepchild."
7711,untitled-red-sequel-movie,Kyle Smith,25,How bad could the boneyard be compared to sitting through this execrable piece of non-entertainment? Better dead than RED 2.
7712,eastern-promises-movie,Rick Groen,75,"What it doesn't have is the resonance of Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence,"" a film that exploited the same genre even while transcending its limitations. Eastern Promises delivers, but not on that scale."
7713,dr-dolittle-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"It's a cloying, humorless motion picture whose only assets are the work of Jim Henson's Creature Shop and a couple of good one-liners by a pair of rodents. "
7714,extremely-loud-and-incredibly-close-movie,Scott Tobias,0,"It will always be ""too soon"" for Extremely Loud And Incredibly Close, which processes the immense grief of a city and a family through a conceit so nauseatingly precious that it's somehow both too literary and too sentimental, cloying yet aestheticized within an inch of its life. "
7715,alice-through-the-looking-glass-movie,Richard Roeper,38,"The sequel to Tim Burton’s 2010 mega-hit “Alice in Wonderland” is loud, frantic, stunningly unfunny, off-putting and riddled with mediocre, out-of-tune work from normally outstanding actors. It’s one of the great movie disasters of 2016."
7716,days-of-grace-movie,Bilge Ebiri,70,"Days of Grace is strong, brutal, despairing stuff. It’s also somewhat anticlimactic, by design."
7717,sex-with-strangers-movie,Jessica Winter,20,"Choppy, overlong documentary."
7718,freddy-got-fingered-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,"It's a performance that screams ""Look at me!"" louder and bigger than an elephant dick. And every bit as subtle."
7719,the-quiet-ones-movie,Lou Lumenick,25,"Veteran screenwriter John Pogue, in his second directorial outing, tries repeatedly and mostly unsuccessfully to jolt his audience by amping up the abundant sound effects to ear-shattering levels."
7720,fame-movie,Michael Sragow,0,"Fame has today's usual gritty form of slick to it, but in every other way it's an Amateur Hour and a half."
7721,rams-movie,Michael Upchurch,75,Where the film falters is in establishing a cohesive tone.
7722,margin-call-movie,Rex Reed,25,"As a movie, it's so tightly framed you gasp from claustrophobia. As a film of cryptic boredom, I cannot believe the actors were able to say their lines without cue cards. "
7723,iron-man-3-movie,Chris Cabin,88,"A madly creative, darkly comical, and fiendishly self-aware actioner with muscle to spare."
7724,breaking-the-waves-movie,Russell Smith,89,"With this artlessly profound and affecting story of love, von Trier emerges as one of those blessed filmmakers  who've managed to blend their early stylistic flamboyance with enough human empathy to make their work both visually and emotionally compelling."
7725,the-wash-movie,Ernest Hardy,0,"What the film suffers from most, though, are its own low aspirations: stroking the libidos and funny bones of brain-dead 12-year-old boys immersed in the shallow end of hip-hop."
7726,ajami-movie,Ty Burr,88,"It’s much too easy to call Ajami an Arab-Israeli “Crash,’’ but it’s a pretty good place to start."
7727,the-gallows-movie,John Hazelton,30,The Gallows offers up few new ideas and very few genuine scares.
7728,focus-2015-movie,Betsy Sharkey,70,The film is breezy from start to finish.
7729,trollhunter-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,38,The film's real problem is that it can't seem to make up its mind about whether it wants to frighten us or make us laugh.
7730,310-to-yuma-movie,William Arnold,67,"The result bears so little resemblance to the original that you have to wonder what happened. It seems more a remake of ""How the West Was Won"" than 3:10 to Yuma."
7731,brimstone-movie,Richard Roeper,38,"For all the visceral depictions of hatred and violence and human destruction, it feels as if the director is chasing his own tail and forgetting about making it all mean something."
7732,philadelphia-movie,Desson Howe,10,"Directed by Jonathan Demme, and starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, this AIDS courtroom drama is so pumped full of nitrous oxide, you could get your teeth drilled on it."
7733,the-6th-day-movie,Michael Atkinson,30,Offers director Roger Spottiswoode a chance to have the worst actor in Beverly Hills play scenes with himself.
7734,lost-in-la-mancha-movie,Derek Elley,80,"There's no shortage of disaster stories in the history of film production, but none have been recorded with such frankness, immediacy and aching sense of disappointment."
7735,force-majeure-movie,Drew McWeeny,91,"Force Majeure is an impressive and adult piece of work, bracing and intelligent."
7736,professor-marston-the-wonder-women-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"A story of courage and sacrifice, as well as a moving love story that’s really three love stories in one."
7737,the-rules-of-attraction-movie,Ty Burr,63,"If there's one thing Avary gets right, it's the brutal use-or-be-used approach to interpersonal relations that Ellis laid out with numbing detail, and James Van Der Beek is down to the challenge as Sean Bateman: horndog, cokehead, ceramics major, and all-around jerk."
7738,the-manson-family-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"There's no real journalism here, just the sort of appalling revisionism that can turn a bloodbath into a beach party."
7739,yellow-submarine-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Perhaps because the Beatles were considered such a draw, perhaps because the songs were counted on to sell the film, there was no agenda to dumb down the material or hard-sell the story. Instead of contrived urgency, there's unpressured whimsy, and the movie exists as pure charm, expressed in fantastical imagery. And then there are the songs."
7740,falling-down-movie,Mike Clark,12,"Hopped-up Falling Down is a technically proficient grabber that exploits white-male angst while adeptly juggling two stories filmed in contrasting styles. Slick, maybe facile, and with a nasty streak, it is nonetheless 1993's first consistently engrossing movie. [26 Feb 1993, p.1D]"
7741,inside-out-movie,Chuck Bowen,12,"Inside Out should be wild and violent, playing on the soap-operatic mood swings that drive televised wrestling; instead it's one or two murders away from being a Lifetime movie of the week. "
7742,the-last-house-on-the-left-movie,Michael Sragow,0,It's a gore sundae with an S&M cherry on top.
7743,the-a-team-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,The whole movie is a diversionary activity. It's trash so compacted it glows.
7744,jerry-maguire-movie,Michael Wilmington,75,"A hip, funny, knowing romantic sports comedy that gets a little strained when it tries to expose its heart. [13 December 1996, Friday, p.A]"
7745,a-warriors-heart-movie,Diego Semerene,0,A Warrior's Heart is so inept at developing itself as a film that it hands in all of its devices to the soundtrack itself and becomes a music video. 
7746,pretty-woman-movie,Rita Kempley,80,"Roberts and Richard Gere costar in this bubbly scamper, which goes to the head like champagne -- the cheap, sweet kind that leaves you with a throbbing head. And yet this monstrously derivative romance is great giddy fun."
7747,mojave-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,70,"Mojave’s real reason for existing is the wiry, woolly dialogue that Monahan has spun out for his actors. "
7748,grind-movie,Kevin Carr,0,Grind is an answer to the question that has been on the minds of many this summer: “Is there anything worse than Gigli?” The answer to this question is a resounding “YES!”
7749,the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"The tone of The Killing of a Sacred Deer is the best thing about it and the hardest to describe. You might call it skewed, except that what often is called skewed is extreme and outlandish, while this movie is quiet and precise."
7750,road-house-movie,Caryn James,10,"In Road House, Patrick Swayze has the most laughable role since Tom Cruise juggled a few liquor bottles and danced to ''The Hippy Hippy Shakes'' in Cocktail...Next to Dalton, Johnny Castle in Dirty Dancing seems like Hamlet. Mr. Swayze does some dirty fighting here, but mostly the role requires a blank expression. At this point, Road House makes his career look like a bad joke."
7751,tchoupitoulas-movie,Drew Hunt,75,"The overall experience is entirely immersive, thanks not only to the filmmakers' handheld camera, but also to the illusory nature of the staging."
7752,but-im-a-cheerleader-movie,Kevin Thomas,20,Works against its goals.
7753,jerry-maguire-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,88,"Working from his own original screenplay, Crowe builds a story line full of unexpected twists and digressions."
7754,barbershop-the-next-cut-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,A cut above the season’s other belated sequels like “My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2’’ and “Zoolander 2.’’
7755,arctic-tale-movie,Gregory Kirschling,75,It's a respectable attempt to get kids who like cuddly animals thinking about death and destruction on a global scale.
7756,10-things-i-hate-about-you-movie,Alisha Davis,80,"Pure formula. But thanks to charming performances, particularly from its two stars, the winsome Stiles and a hunky Heath, it gets the recipe right, and the result is surprisingly sweet."
7757,the-future-movie,Ann Hornaday,75,"What does The Future hold? Wonders, each of them weirder and more unnerving than the last. "
7758,the-5th-wave-movie,Allison Shoemaker,33,"Blakeson and screenwriters Susannah Grant, Akiva Goldsman, and Jeff Pinkner don’t seem to care much about telling the story. They’re just checking off the boxes."
7759,equilibrium-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"Equilibrium is like a remake of ""1984"" by someone who's seen ""The Matrix"" 25 times while eating Twinkies and doing methamphetamines."
7760,breath-movie,Luke Buckmaster,80,"It is the rarest kind of sports movie, in that it will encourage in participants a different, thoroughly thoughtful perspective with which to view their pastime. Breath is a surfer film with soul and gravitas."
7761,dirty-love-movie,Jami Bernard,38,The movie equivalent of a medical experiment gone horribly wrong and kept in a jar of formaldehyde as a warning to others: Comedy can be a deadly weapon in the wrong hands.
7762,lockout-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"Directors James Mather and Stephen St. Leger stage a few good action set pieces, but unlike the 1981 midnight movie classic it imitates, the blandly titled Lockout never busts out of its cheesy concept."
7763,star-wars-episode-i---the-phantom-menace-movie,Roger Ebert,88,An astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking.
7764,ouija-movie,Marc Savlov,11,"Hasbro’s long-lasting occult board game gets its own starring role in a film that makes those other recent Hasbro plaything adaptations – namely ""Transformers"" and ""G.I. Joe"" – look like triumphs of subtly engineered cinematic magic."
7765,asylum-movie,Ann Hornaday,10,Shouldn't fool viewers into thinking it's anything but a pseudo-artsy piece of tripe.
7766,aloha-movie,Roger Moore,38,"The performances are passable, save for Murray — who goes ham, and Alec Baldwin, as a general who goes comically nuclear. He at least leaves an impression."
7767,battlefield-earth-a-saga-of-the-year-3000-movie,Sean Means,0,"In the pantheon of cinematic train wrecks, from ""Ishtar"" to ""Waterworld,"" set a place at the table for Battlefield Earth."
7768,mansome-movie,Nathan Rabin,0,"If Spurlock had simply followed Waters around for 80 minutes, the result would be more entertaining than Mansome. Hell, 80 minutes of John Waters sleeping would be more fun than Mansome."
7769,tupac-resurrection-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"As you listen to his uncanny narration of Tupac: Resurrection, which is stitched together from interviews, you realize you're not listening to the usual self-important vacancies from celebrity Q&As, but to spoken prose of a high order, in which analysis, memory and poetry come together seamlessly in sentences and paragraphs that sound as if they were written."
7770,predator-movie,Michael Wilmington,10,"It's arguably one of the emptiest, feeblest, most derivative scripts ever made as a major studio movie. There's no need to do a Mad magazine movie parody of this; it's already on the screen."
7771,big-fat-liar-movie,John Dentino,20,Old people are made to look ridiculous; clowns are brutalized; characters talk in rapid-fire vaudeville shtick.
7772,price-of-glory-movie,Sean Means,30,"It's not easy to go 12 rounds against a cliche-ridden story like Price of Glory and remain standing. But somehow stars Jimmy Smits and Jon Seda, and first-time director Carlos Avila, manage to survive."
7773,buffalo-soldiers-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,"Even Phoenix, an actor who can make an incestuous-minded Roman emperor seem sensitive, can't smooth over political nihilism this unsavory."
7774,still-walking-movie,Steven Rea,100,Pitch-perfect and profoundly moving.
7775,the-master-of-disguise-movie,Dennis Harvey,20,"Vehicle for Dana Carvey as a chameleonic crime-fighting imbecile is noisy, colorful and fart-gag-filled enough to amuse undiscriminating auds under the age of 10."
7776,the-hoax-movie,Deborah Young,80,"Lasse Hallstrom's breezy, fast-paced, somewhat loose-ended account of how he (Irving) did it offers a surprisingly layered vehicle for a maniacally conniving Richard Gere, backed up by a superb Alfred Molina as his accomplice."
7777,you-kill-me-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"It's the best role in years for Leoni, but You Kill Me really belongs to Kingsley, whose character's deadpan reactions to his new environment are priceless. He really kills."
7778,inglourious-basterds-movie,Lou Lumenick,88,May be the most fun you'll have at the movies this summer.
7779,stroker-ace-movie,Staff (Not Credited),25,"Burt Reynolds hits new lows as he mugs his way through this film as Stroker Ace, a race-car driver who's under the control of chicken-franchise owner Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The script is filled with good ol' boy humor and car crackups. "
7780,thelma-louise-movie,Brad Laidman,80,Grade A propaganda of the first order.
7781,mr-poppers-penguins-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"There's no story beyond the utterly formulaic and not the slightest semblance of realism, but your kids will enjoy it if they're young enough and pretty easy to please. "
7782,the-snowman-movie,Dan Mecca,25,"Something happened here, and the full story of the making of this movie will surely be far more interesting than the movie itself."
7783,audition-movie,Bob Graham,75,This movie can be recommended only to dyed-in-the-wool fans of the genre. Anyone who goes into one of Miike's films must be prepared to be put through the wringer.
7784,black-book-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"It's a messy, colorful big-screen entertainment that veers from sober period piece to outrageous melodrama, which is to say it's a Verhoeven movie."
7785,the-brothers-bloom-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"This movie is lively at times, it's lovely to look at, and the actors are persuasive in very difficult material. But around and around it goes, and where it stops, nobody by that point much cares."
7786,solo-a-star-wars-story-movie,Dan Jolin,80,A bright and breezy sideshow adventure makes up for its overly frantic pacing with a charismatic central turn from Alden Ehrenreich — strong enough to make us want to see even more of him in Solo mode.
7787,hotel-artemis-movie,Richard Lawson,67,"For roughly its first half, Hotel Artemis glides nicely on all of Pearce’s world-building and the cast’s confident performances. But as the power flickers at the Artemis and dangerous foes close in, the movie starts to wobble. Pearce has maybe put too many variables in play and has trouble connecting them into a unified narrative."
7788,28-days-movie,Kenneth Turan,20,Too glib too often to make much of an impression any way you look at it.
7789,the-canyons-movie,Chuck Bowen,12,"Paul Schrader and Brett Easton Ellis don't have the sense of play this kind of narrative of one-upmanship requires, as we're never allowed to enjoy the characters' misdeeds. "
7790,calendar-girls-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"While each Yorkshire playmate-of-the-month warmly assesses her own undewy flesh, the movie gives off a happy vibe of appreciation -- for the dignity of the real Rylstone lot, the actresses who play them so lovingly, and the simple, flower-bed borders of the story. "
7791,little-miss-sunshine-movie,Ken Fox,100,"What makes husband-and-wife directing team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' hilarious debut such a great family film isn't that it's suitable for the whole family (it's not), but that it speaks a simple truth about what it means to be part of one."
7792,apartment-troubles-movie,Roger Moore,38,A nearly laughless comedy that doesn’t do its writer/director/stars any favors.
7793,stonehearst-asylum-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,30,"This shockingly flabby effort from Mr. Anderson — who, in features like “The Machinist” (2004) and “Session 9” (2001), showed a much surer hand with oppressive atmospheres and troubled psyches — feels as nutty as its characters."
7794,invictus-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Clint Eastwood, a master director, orchestrates all of these notes and has us loving Mandela, proud of Francois and cheering for the plucky Springboks. A great entertainment. Not, as I said, the Mandela biopic I would have expected."
7795,jakob-the-liar-movie,Michael Atkinson,19,"A trial of cliche, strained optimism, and dire quasi-comedy."
7796,the-in-crowd-movie,Godfrey Cheshire,10,"Murky, unappealing The In Crowd is a femme-centered melodrama that makes an awkward stretch into thriller territory."
7797,exists-movie,David Ehrlich,0,"Exists isn’t a found-footage horror movie about Bigfoot experts; it’s one about a group of stranded cinematographers. Just kidding, it’s obviously about a group of stupid young people who couldn’t shoot a competent Vine, let alone a visually coherent feature. "
7798,third-person-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Paul Haggis’ Third Person has nothing to say and spends 2 ¹/₂ hours not saying it. Its combination of pretentiousness, vanity and vapidity suggests Alain Resnais directing a triple episode of “Guiding Light.”"
7799,project-nim-movie,Andrea Gronvall,80,"Sexual politics, family dynamics, the debate over heredity versus environment, and the dubious ethics of scientific research on animals are rigorously explored in this ambitious, bittersweet work. "
7800,katyn-movie,Leslie Felperin,90,"This plays almost like an academic master class, meticulously exploring the event's ramifications but only catching full fire at the end."
7801,the-emoji-movie-movie,Emily Yoshida,0,"It is one of the darkest, most dismaying films I have ever seen, much less one ostensibly made for children."
7802,i-dreamed-of-africa-movie,Robert Horton,30,There is no obvious reason for the film's meandering existence: it's a series of beautifully photographed postcards of Africa.
7803,i-love-you-beth-cooper-movie,Peter Travers,25,"Aiming for the heartfelt hilarity of ""Superbad,"" I Love You, Beth Cooper is just super bad."
7804,half-past-dead-movie,Maitland McDonagh,30,"Sleek, pointless action picture."
7805,shallow-hal-movie,Rita Kempley,20,Nothing could save this movie. These guys make a fortune off the comedy of cruelty. How dare they climb on a soapbox?
7806,the-last-seduction-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,80,"Unlike the classic noirs, this is grounded in neither a recognizable social reality nor a metaphysical sense of doom--just a lot of sexy attitude, humping, and heavy breathing."
7807,horrible-bosses-2-movie,Drew Taylor,25,"The fact that the sequel is a messy, dull, instantly forgettable trifle somehow makes it the perfect follow-up to the original -- it's just as horrible."
7808,mulholland-dr-movie,Peter Travers,90,The challenge is exhilarating. You can discover a lot about yourself by getting lost in Mulholland Drive. It grips you like a dream that won't let go.
7809,the-book-of-henry-movie,Emily Yoshida,0,"It does not suffice to call The Book of Henry bad; it’s nonfunctional, so poorly conceived from the ground up as to slip out of the grasp of the usual standards one applies to narrative film. It might be admirable if it wasn’t such torture to watch."
7810,beyond-borders-movie,Marc Savlov,20,"I came out of Beyond Borders with the gnawing feeling I'd just been subjected to some sort of ghastly prank, Punk’d by the director of ""GoldenEye"" with Lara Croft as his willing confederate."
7811,the-time-machine-movie,Jonathan Foreman,38,"So tedious it's almost worth watching to see just how bad acting, inadequate direction and most important, a criminally crass and unimaginative screenplay can make so little out of a proven idea."
7812,the-bye-bye-man-movie,Peter Sobczynski,12,"Speaking of the characters, they are as bland and uninteresting as can be."
7813,bird-on-a-wire-movie,Jay Boyar,37,"Nominally a romantic action-comedy, this Goldie Hawn-Mel Gibson picture is actually a mind-numbingly raucous exploitation flick with occasional bad jokes and mild sex scenes. [18 May 1990, p.21]"
7814,ruby-sparks-movie,Rex Reed,25,"The script is breezy, but neither of the two leads have the heft or charm to carry an entire feature-length film - separately or together. "
7815,running-scared-movie,J.R. Jones,30,"A vicious, incoherent shoot-'em-up."
7816,gun-shy-movie,Don Kaye,5,We're just over a month into 2000 and already there's a candidate for the year's worst picture.
7817,marguerite-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"t’s possible to laugh at Marguerite and with her at the same time. Cover your ears at key moments, and you may even fall in love with her."
7818,american-assassin-movie,Kate Taylor,12,"This movie is not just badly executed, it's also stupid."
7819,enron-the-smartest-guys-in-the-room-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,Should hold you spellbound.
7820,lion-movie,Brian Truitt,88,"Unsurprisingly, the finale is manipulative in every way, squeezing out the emotions of the audience. But Lion’s well-plotted narrative and thoughtful characters suck you in so much that the journey there is totally worth it."
7821,the-13th-warrior-movie,G. Allen Johnson,38,"In tackling 1000 A.D., (McTiernan)'s  suddenly an unwieldy, clunky filmmaker."
7822,center-stage-movie,Staff,0,"While movie reviewers like to throw around the line, ""This is the worst movie I've ever seen,"" this movie may be the worst movie I've ever seen."
7823,my-own-private-idaho-movie,Vincent Canby,100,"The film itself is invigorating - written, directed, and acted with enormous insight and comic elan. [27 Sept 1991]"
7824,john-q-movie,Stephen Hunter,20,"This movie, written in crayon by James Kearns, is too dumb to come up with a way of defeating the system by using its own rules."
7825,big-mommas-like-father-like-son-movie,John P. McCarthy,10,"Starved of humor and energy, the interminable Big Mommas: Life Father, Like Son could force Lawrence and co-star Brandon T. Jackson undercover for real."
7826,short-cuts-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"It's a genuine pleasure to find a movie with such a deep and intelligent portrayal of simple human lives, with all their minor triumphs and tragedies."
7827,the-city-of-lost-children-movie,Kim Newman,100,"The City Of Lost Children is as great a film as you thought ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" was when you were five years old."
7828,hounddog-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,0,"Fanning is remarkably collected and even dignified. As for the rest of the gang, they ought to be returned to sender."
7829,bless-the-child-movie,Rita Kempley,10,The scariest thing about this hokey bombast is that it got made in the first place.
7830,persepolis-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,90,The filmmakers were right to believe that a live-action version of this story would have failed to achieve the universality Persepolis does.
7831,harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Is Prisoner of Azkaban as good as the first two films? Not quite. It doesn't have that sense of joyously leaping through a clockwork plot, and it needs to explain more than it should. But the world of Harry Potter remains delightful, amusing and sophisticated."
7832,the-maze-runner-scorch-trials-movie,Ed Gonzalez,38,"Every set piece brings to mind an Epcot Center attraction built from borrowed parts, geared toward reinforcing the young audience's belief that adults just don't understand them."
7833,guess-whos-coming-to-dinner-movie,A.D. Murphy,100,"Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner is an outstanding Stanley Kramer production, superior in almost every imaginable way, which examines its subject matter with perception, depth, insight, humor and feeling."
7834,stolen-summer-movie,Connie Ogle,38,The best story here is the one about how Stolen Summer made it to the screen; that's more compelling than anything that happens in Pete's world.
7835,shaft-movie,Wesley Morris,63,"The movie's primary narrative weakness is that its racism plot points seem ripped from the headlines of a ""Geraldo"" newsletter and stretched into a string of terribly executed car chases."
7836,haiku-tunnel-movie,Jonathan Foreman,12,"Amazingly amateurish, the film lands wide of satirical targets that should be impossible to miss."
7837,frida-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"Alfred Molina makes an excellent foil as the easygoing, philandering Rivera, whose public murals were the exact opposite of Frida's private canvases."
7838,the-crew-movie,Roger Ebert,38,The Crew is all contrivance and we don't believe a minute of it.
7839,ratatouille-movie,Ian Nathan,100,That feeling you have as you leave the cinema - that buzzing in the fingers and lightness in the heart - is called joy.
7840,waste-land-movie,Michelle Orange,80,"A dump is a dump, but it's immediately clear that these are working people who are making the best of their options and who have built a shared camaraderie out of that determination."
7841,im-so-excited-movie,Keith Uhlich,80,"It’s high time Pedro had a lark. The buoyant and bawdy I’m So Excited plays like a to-hell-with-it-all riff from this seminal Spanish auteur, an excuse to gather his stock company for a breezy 90-minute party."
7842,high-tension-movie,Michael Sragow,0,The movie is a model of multinational incompetence.
7843,vhs2-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,20,V/H/S/2 is for gore hounds exclusively.
7844,do-the-right-thing-movie,Desson Thomson,100,There's no doubt about the film's sheer power and taut originality.
7845,coco-2017-movie,Christopher Orr,90,"Does Coco rise to the heights of Pixar’s very best work? No. But it is a generous, heartfelt film, full of color and music, one that offers a timely Thanksgiving tribute to the intergenerational importance of family."
7846,dinner-for-schmucks-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,70,"Carell's performance as Barry, is nothing short of magnificent."
7847,the-boys-are-back-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,67,"With those piercing eyes, Owen makes a lovely, soulful Joe, of course. But it's not the nice papa we want to understand here, it's the unapologetically naughty one."
7848,first-reformed-movie,David Sims,95,"The result is an embittered look at our world through the eyes of someone who’s increasingly horrified to be a part of it, and a film that’s one of the most searing cinema experiences of the year."
7849,liam-movie,Kevin Maynard,80,"Liam is mostly an emotionally devastating chronicle of the disintegration of a family. The entire cast is superb, but Frears has cast two screen naturals in the lead roles."
7850,getaway-movie,Peter Travers,0,"When Macbeth said, ""It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing,"" he must have had visions about Courtney Solomon's Getaway, a car chase thriller with zero thrills and a stench that all the perfumes of Arabia couldn't erase."
7851,bully-movie,Dennis Harvey,10,"By turns turgid, embarrassing and plain off-putting."
7852,the-thin-red-line-movie,J. Hoberman,90,"As mystical as it is gritty, as despairing as it is detached."
7853,the-real-cancun-movie,Kevin Carr,10,"It is films like this that make me think that if Mexico suddenly went to war with a superpower, and the Cancun area was nuked into oblivion during a spring break weekend, that the world might actually be a better place. "
7854,earth-movie,Janice Page,75,"This Earth doesn't really have anything new to say, but it does present some newly entertaining ways of saying it."
7855,oldboy-2013-movie,Michael Phillips,38,The revenge in Oldboy is neither sweet nor sour; it's just drab.
7856,extraordinary-measures-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"Everything about this excruciatingly dull, talky film screams made-for-network-TV: The I'm-only-here-for-a-paycheck performances by famous actors; the Crate and Barrel catalog mise-en-scene; the syrupy, heartwarming score that lays the pathos on so thickly you gag on it."
7857,the-replacements-movie,Kenneth Turan,10,A haphazard film about half as sophisticated as the average beer commercial.
7858,crazy-on-the-outside-movie,Peter Travers,0,Allen screws up his directing debut with a script that smothers his wit in a blanket of bland.
7859,playing-the-field-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,30,"Simply put, it's a mess."
7860,the-crying-game-movie,Hal Hinson,100,"From the performances by Rea, Davidson and Whitaker, to Jordan's endlessly original script, to Anne Dudley's melancholy score, and Lyle Lovett's closing rendition of ""Stand by Your Man,"" The Crying Game enthralls and amazes us. It deserves to be called great."
7861,the-attack-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,75,"On one level, The Attack is a mystery, but not the kind you think. It’s obvious from the start who detonated the bomb; the only question is why. It’s a question that probably cannot be answered to the satisfaction of anyone living outside Israel or the occupied territories."
7862,magic-mike-movie,Mark Olsen,80,"By way of remarkable sleight-of-hand, Steven Soderbergh's Magic Mike both is and is not the freewheeling, fun-loving, male stripper extravaganza its trailers peddle."
7863,jawbreaker-movie,Dennis Lim,0,"Stein's script is slack and tin-eared, too feeble to pass for satire, and inadequate even by lazy-pastiche standards."
7864,dumb-and-dumberer-when-harry-met-lloyd-movie,James Berardinelli,0,No movie could be more aptly compared to raw sewage than this film. 
7865,mr-magoriums-wonder-emporium-movie,Ken Fox,63,This isn't your usual kiddie fare: Beneath the initial glare and blare is a quietly literate script by first-time writer-director Zach Helm that deals directly with big issues like believing in yourself and living on after a loved one passes away. But is it heavy? Not really.
7866,hotel-artemis-movie,Mark Kennedy,25,"Writer and director Drew Pearce has made an uneven feature film directorial debut. He flaps around for a consistent tone, stunts some potential story lines and kicks out a bunch of cliches. Then, clearly unable to find a rational way to end his film, he adds two massive doses of nonsensical ultra-violence."
7867,the-tourist-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"This woefully botched mystery-adventure-thriller-caper-romance-comedy, or whatever it was meant to be, is no fun at all."
7868,a-bugs-life-movie,Jeff Giles,100,"All-embracing--funny and silly and tender, full of fun scares and endless sight gags."
7869,maleficent-movie,Peter Travers,38,"Jolie comes to this party ready to bite, but the movie muzzles her. Even at 97 minutes, Maleficent is still one long, laborious slog."
7870,space-station-3d-movie,Scott Foundas,70,"Like a really, really high-tech version of a high school class trip to the planetarium."
7871,kill-bill-vol-2-movie,J. Hoberman,70,What's surprising is the atmosphere of sweet reason--elatively speaking--that distinguishes Kill Bill Vol. 2 from its bloody precursor. 
7872,a-walk-to-remember-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,30,"Audiences who have avoided the multiplex these last few years because of the garbage peddled there are the only ones for whom this overly familiar ""Walk"" will be memorable."
7873,the-punisher-movie,David Edelstein,20,"A sickeningly manipulative, by-the-numbers revenge movie. "
7874,the-whole-ten-yards-movie,Kevin Crust,20,Disastrously unfunny sequel.
7875,after-the-ball-movie,Frank Scheck,30,"Featuring enough stereotypical characterizations and situations to fuel a dozen artificial rom-coms, After the Ball pretty much drops the ball in every aspect."
7876,private-school-movie,Bill Cosford,25,"Strange as it sounds, the failure of this tawdry little odyssey into mammalia is that it doesn't make any sense. The smallest effort by writer, director or producer could have meant a movie with laughs as well as the capacity to anesthetize adults. [02 Aug 1983, p.C5]"
7877,apres-vous-after-you-movie,Jean Oppenheimer,30,Proves an absolute chore to sit through.
7878,fair-game-movie,Staff (Not Credited),10,"Fair Game is otherwise notable only for its jaw-dropping stupidity, the sort of action yarn that hopes nonstop mayhem will help cloud just how nonsensical it is."
7879,the-amityville-horror-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Shoddily made, boring and, most shockingly, without a single decent scare."
7880,corpus-callosum-movie,Scott Foundas,100,"Watching Corpus Callosum and marveling at its sprightliness, its joyous, imaginative air, its effortless attenuation to all that is wonderful and horrible and comical about modern technology, makes you want to jump up and shout for joy, too."
7881,the-pink-panther-2-movie,Staff [Not Credited],38,Perhaps Martin should go back to taking chances and writing original work.
7882,abandon-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"With the flat characters and lifeless performances, it's a wonder that anyone in the audience can stay awake all the way through this dull and dreary production."
7883,king-kong-movie,Michael Phillips,88,"The new Kong is just different enough to be terrific screen company. His relationship with his leading lady, played with heart and panache by Naomi Watts, doesn't feel like an old story retold. It feels like a brand new story."
7884,left-behind-2014-movie,Andrew Barker,10,"With a “Sharknado”-inspired visual style and a deeply weary lead performance from Nicolas Cage, Left Behind is cheap-looking, overwrought kitsch of the most unintentionally hilarious order."
7885,closed-curtain-movie,Inkoo Kang,80,"Closed Curtain is richly allegorical, but the film succeeds even more as an exiled artist's reassurance that the law can't stamp out art."
7886,turn-me-on-dammit!-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"Jannicke Systad Jacobsen, a documentary maker directing her first fiction film, demonstrates a sure sense of tone, and Bergsholm is memorable as the misfit teen."
7887,gothika-movie,Peter Travers,25,Stupefyingly stupid thriller. 
7888,the-color-of-paradise-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,The simplicity and idealism of The Color of Paradise are part of what makes it so attractive to near-jaded palates here. There are no evil characters in the film.
7889,ballast-movie,Robert Koehler,100,"A rock-ribbed sense of committed, personal cinema and a core belief in people being able to pull themselves out of misery supports Ballast, an extraordinary debut by editor-writer-director Lance Hammer."
7890,maggies-plan-movie,Moira Macdonald,88,"It’s a sweet, faintly screwball, faintly Shakespearean look at love, families and what happens when a well-made plan goes just a bit awry."
7891,blast-from-the-past-movie,Hazel-Dawn Dumpert,30,"A flimsy premise to begin with, it’s been punctured beyond repair by an amateur script from Bill Kelly and director Hugh Wilson (The First Wives Club), and by Wilson’s shocking ineptitude with dialogue, framing and pace."
7892,kiss-of-the-spider-woman-movie,Bob Graham,100,Don't be too quick to jump on Hurt with complaints of old-fashioned gay stereotyping. Only with a development well into the movie will the audience realize the layers he brought to Molina's role-playing.
7893,ghost-ship-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"See evil. See evil run. Run, evil, run all the way to cable television purgatory."
7894,the-raven-movie,John DeFore,38,"Director James McTeigue was much more successful capturing graphic novelist Alan Moore's mood in ""V for Vendetta"" than he is conjuring the bone-chilling suspense of Poe. But viewed as simply another Hollywood thriller, The Raven builds up a decent head of steam as time runs out for our hero's imperiled fiancee."
7895,warcraft-movie,David Ehrlich,0,"This is truly a depressing experience. It’s rare to feel such pity for a major studio movie, but watching Warcraft bend over backwards to set up a sequel is like watching a desperate paramedic apply CPR to someone who’s clearly been dead for hours. "
7896,2010-movie,Danny Bowes,80,2010 is an essential text of the late Cold War.
7897,deliverance-movie,John Patterson,100,"For all the furious excitement of its river-rafting sequences, and the harshness and humiliation of its explosive central rape scene, Deliverance is an elegiac movie, mourning the rural mountain culture soon to be inundated by a new hydro-electric dam."
7898,eight-crazy-nights-movie,Mark Caro,25,Its humor stems precisely from our enjoying its lead character's rotten behavior.
7899,raising-victor-vargas-movie,Jean Oppenheimer,90,While Sollett provided cast members with a detailed breakdown of the story--a kind of narrative guide--he wanted them to improvise their own dialogue based on how they would react to a similar situation in their own lives....The result is quite extraordinary.
7900,the-meyerowitz-stories-new-and-selected-movie,Michael Phillips,75,"All the performances are terrific, even when some of the scenes sputter or reiterate the grievances."
7901,van-helsing-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Nothing's alive in this trash-heap travesty of warm-weather entertainment, despite the frenetic pace."
7902,i-dreamed-of-africa-movie,Kevin Maynard,39,Why waste the price of a movie ticket when you can see wildebeests cavorting for free from the comfort of your own recliner?
7903,new-years-eve-movie,Nathan Rabin,33,"It's safe to say to no idea was nixed on the set of New Year's Eve for being too cheesy or sentimental; if anything, ideas were nixed for not being sentimental or cheesy enough."
7904,did-you-wonder-who-fired-the-gun-movie,Richard Brody,100,"Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?...is an overwhelming experience. It fills the current American landscape with the hatred, oppression, and violence that also scars its history."
7905,the-eagle-movie,David Edelstein,70,"The Eagle is furiously unsettled-thematically, temporally, meteorologically. Wild-eyed, long-haired Brits leap atop the Romans' shields as the soldiers blindly hack away, the bodies so close that you can barely tell the victor from the vanquished. The battles in the fog and rain have a hallucinatory power. "
7906,the-bounty-hunter-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Someday, The Bounty Hunter and last month’s “Cop Out” will be featured in a cable movie double bill as the two worst 1988 films of 2010."
7907,dr-dolittle-2-movie,Desson Thomson,30,Best news: over in 87 minutes.
7908,van-helsing-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"Sommers film just lies there, weighted down by a complete lack of wit, artfulness and internal logic. So it's a disaster -- a big, loud, boring wreck. "
7909,before-night-falls-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"There is a little something of the spoiled masochist about Arenas. One would not say he seeks misery, but he wears it like a badge of honor, and we can see his mistakes approaching before he does. This is not a weakness in the film but one of its intriguing strengths"
7910,americons-movie,Oktay Ege Kozak,16,Americons is a shady sub-prime loan you should not waste your time and energy on.
7911,ran-re-release-movie,Kevin Thomas,100,"Ran, which translates as ""chaos"" or ""turmoil,"" is at once brisk and vital, elegiac and contemplative, intimate and epic, tragic yet shot through with humor. It combines the energy of youth with the perspective of maturity. It encompasses all of human nature in its folly and grandeur, and it does so in images as beautiful and terrifying as any ever captured on film and in performances that are impeccable."
7912,sliding-doors-movie,Troy Patterson,75,"The story is hackneyed, and the gimmick only doubles the dullardry."
7913,memento-movie,Rita Kempley,90,"Unforgettable, especially in Pearce's startling performance."
7914,elizabeth-movie,Jeff Giles,70,"Kapur can't decide if he's making an art movie or a melodrama, an opera or a soap opera."
7915,i-am-number-four-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"I Am Number Four, with its gangly title, seems like a dimwitted cousin to those hipper properties - a Superman-come-lately tale of puppy love, extraordinary powers and puberty that's duller than a chalkboard and less powerful than an extraneous Jonas brother."
7916,slackers-movie,Roger Ebert,0,"A dirty movie. Not a sexy, erotic, steamy or even smutty movie, but a just plain dirty movie. It made me feel unclean, and I'm the guy who liked ""There's Something About Mary"" and both ""American Pie"" movies."
7917,trumbo-movie,Kyle Smith,25,"The misleading documentary Trumbo paints a golden nimbus of holiness around the onetime highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood, Dalton Trumbo, an on-the-record hater of democracy, defender of authoritarian rule and avowed Communist."
7918,inside-out-2015-movie,Michael Phillips,88,The life of Riley is not exotic; her troubles are not unique. But they are rendered with serious imagination by Docter and company.
7919,her-alibi-movie,Jay Carr,12,"There's no excuse for Her Alibi. [3 Feb 1989, p.42]"
7920,mama-movie,Erik McClanahan,33,"By the time the ridiculous child psychologist character encounters a government employee with a convenient bounty of useful information, Mama just becomes laughable, then annoying. "
7921,the-sapphires-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"The raggedness of The Sapphires can’t be separated from its exuberant charm. Like the Sapphires themselves, the film is determined to muscle its way into your heart, which would have to be a lump of gristle to resist it."
7922,dolphin-tale-movie,Neil Genzlinger,70,"Pitched awfully young, without a shred of the satire or subtlety that is generally found in films aimed at tweeners and above. That's not a bad thing; it just means accompanying grown-ups or older siblings will have to choke down a sizable dose of schmaltz with their fish milkshakes. "
7923,the-little-vampire-movie,Gemma Files,10,"Some things just don't translate . . . not with Lipnicki attached, at any rate. Stick with the books."
7924,lake-city-movie,Ronnie Scheib,20,Moore and Hill's script plunges Spacek in a mawkish stew of banality and improbability composed of bits and pieces of earlier roles.
7925,hours-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,80,"The film stirs richer, truer feelings once it becomes a one-man show. This is due both to Heisserer's and Walker's skill — the tension is strong, the scenario elemental, and Walker's harried, urgent hero is compelling — but also the fact that the movies are really good at dudes doing things, especially when those things are scrappy, desperate, and heroic."
7926,daddys-home-movie,Calvin Wilson,75,"If you’re looking for a film that’s just about guaranteed to make you feel good, you’d be well advised to drop by Daddy’s Home."
7927,mothers-and-daughters-movie,Moira Macdonald,38,"Because so few movies focus on stories about women, it’s incredibly frustrating to see this strong cast drifting away on a tide of soap bubbles — there’s no movie here, just scene after scene of melodramatic cliché."
7928,encino-man-movie,Jeff Shannon,38,"I was hoping to miss the preview of Encino Man by scheduling some other, more entertaining diversion like, say, a few hours of unnecessary oral surgery. No such luck...There is a special annex of hell for movies like this, where sinners and simpletons are sent to atone for watching too much MTV. [22 May 1992, p.22]"
7929,the-mortal-instruments-city-of-bones-movie,Peter Hartlaub,25,"Every moviegoer will have his own breaking point, when The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones surpasses the mundane and enters the ridiculous."
7930,mixed-nuts-movie,Hal Hinson,10,"Usually, Ephron is one of the most reliable comic voices in the movies, but here her gifts seem to have deserted her. Though she shows her customary talent for smart one-liners, the spirit of the film is forced and desperate, as if she lacked faith in her gags and were trying to shove them down our throats."
7931,the-woman-in-the-fifth-movie,Ann Hornaday,38,"It's a curio, ripe with dreamy atmospherics and intriguing mysteries, but little else."
7932,excess-baggage-movie,Jack Mathews,20,"Excess Baggage, a scruffy romantic comedy about a despairing rich girl who hatches a kidnapping scheme to test her father's love, is an aimless waste, a star vehicle without a compass. It wants very much to be both funny and poignant, but is more often just noisy and pointless. [29Aug1997 Pg 14]"
7933,g-force-movie,Amy Biancolli,25,"A lot of resources went into making G-Force - a lot of talent, a lot of money, a lot of marketing - and there's not much to show for it, not even some halfway imaginative 3-D gimmickry."
7934,inside-man-movie,Jami Bernard,75,"It's got style and charisma to spare, with all the characters acting from fiery reserves of self-interest, including Christopher Plummer as a bank president with a secret in his safe-deposit box."
7935,last-days-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,In trouble from its first minutes.
7936,some-like-it-hot-movie,Peter Bradshaw,100,"Reinvented by Wilder and co-screenwriter co-writer IAL Diamond, Some Like It Hot is effortlessly fluent, joyous and buoyant: a high-concept comedy that stays as high as a kite, while other comedies flag. ""Nobody's perfect"" is the last line. Wilder, Lemmon, Curtis and Monroe come pretty close."
7937,hukkle-movie,Eric Campos,80,"I love a nice, quiet film. It’s so relaxing and such a nice break from the flashy multiplex fare. I love watching films that you can let just wash over you. The Hungarian film Hukkle provides that comfort, while at the same time coming up with an inventive way to tell a story."
7938,remember-the-titans-movie,Dennis Lim,10,Boorish and flatulent.
7939,driving-lessons-movie,Ruthe Stein,75,"With the aid of a charmingly offbeat story and a jolly good dialect coach, the stars leave you thinking, well done. Their spirited performances help cover up glaring holes in the plot."
7940,the-apostle-movie,Rick Groen,63,"A too-perfect mirror of its creator, The Apostle's greatest strength doubles as a singular weakness -- in the end, it feels like an immaculate forgery."
7941,the-spirit-movie,Michael Phillips,25,"Only Sarah Paulson, as the Spirit's doctor and sometime lover, seems to be in there playing the scenes as if she were a human being in a comic book superhero scenario, as opposed to a comic book character stuck in a cruddy movie."
7942,endless-love-movie,David Edelstein,10,It’s actually worse than the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli–Brooke Shields version  —  which is worse than being waterboarded but at least bears some resemblance to the book and its brilliantly addled ‘70s vibe.
7943,friends-with-kids-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"Credit Westfeldt, who is also the writer and director, with a classic setup for farce, brightly executed."
7944,x-men-the-last-stand-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,Mostly about extending a Hollywood franchise with ever-diminishing returns.
7945,the-musketeer-movie,Marc Savlov,0,Unspeakably awful.

7949,urban-legends-final-cut-movie,Ty Burr,0,Debased swill.
7950,nights-in-rodanthe-movie,Maitland McDonagh,38,A shameless puddle of romantic slop.
7951,green-street-hooligans-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"Soccer needs this movie like Georgia needed ""Deliverance."""
7952,war-room-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,30,"Preachy doesn't begin to describe War Room, a mighty long-winded and wincingly overwrought domestic drama."
7953,my-name-is-khan-movie,Roger Moore,38,The polished production sometimes touches and amuses despite its naïve “love conquers all” script.
7954,lost-souls-movie,William Arnold,33,"A screaming, silly cliche -- and somehow not a bit scary."
7955,antitrust-movie,Peter Travers,10,Gives us good reason to believe that January really is the month Hollywood studios use to bury their cheesiest mistakes.
7956,tyler-perrys-the-single-moms-club-movie,Roger Moore,25,"Perry has made better movies, and perhaps worse ones. But never one as dull as this."
7957,looney-tunes-back-in-action-movie,Stephen Hunter,80,"Delightful, delicious and destructive. "
7958,americas-heart-and-soul-movie,Scott Tobias,10,Represents apple-pie mythmaking at its most insidiously thoughtless. 
7959,light-sleeper-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Light Sleeper isn't about the help he can get from psychics, however; it's about desperation that makes him project healing qualities upon anyone who is halfway sympathetic. The movie is familiar with its life of night and need. It finds the real human qualities in a person like the Susan Sarandon character - who, in a crisis, reacts with loyalty and quick thinking."
7960,dangerous-minds-movie,Roger Ebert,38,"The movie pretends to show poor black kids being bribed into literacy by Dylan and candy bars, but actually it is the crossover white audience that is being bribed with mind-candy in the form of safe words by the two Dylans."
7961,the-maid-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"As it is, The Maid is a study of a character who rarely emerges from the opaque end of the spectrum."
7962,from-paris-with-love-movie,Liam Lacey,25,"The one thing that’s briefly enjoyable about From Paris with Love is John Travolta’s appearance. In a black leather jacket, with a shaved bald head and a goatee and a perpetual scarf to hide his jowls, he looks like a well-fed pimp or a gay bear."
7963,the-great-gilly-hopkins-movie,Diego Semerene,12,Glenn Close's face teems with a flawlessly controlled gravitas that’s completely at odds with the film’s ordinariness.
7964,superheromovie-movie,Ken Fox,0,"This abysmal ""Spider-Man"" satire has more in common with the lamentable spate of ""Epic"" and ""Date Movies"" than Zucker and Nielsen's truly funny ""Naked Gun"" series."
7965,francine-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"Melissa Leo plays her without inflection, giving us no instructions about what our opinion should be. It is a brave performance, an act of empathy with a sad woman."
7966,little-fockers-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Paul Weitz (""Cirque du Freak,"" ""American Dreamz"") takes over as director, and the film shows all the signs of re-shoots and re-edits designed to bring in more characters and perhaps find a few more laughs. "
7967,bulletproof-monk-movie,Nathan Rabin,20,"Sadly, it's yet another intercultural mishmash that hopes for its iconic star's charisma to overcome a dire script, cardboard characters, indifferently directed action scenes, and an atrocious villain buried under layers of unconvincing old-man makeup."
7968,tangerines-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Tangerines is an example of lean, unadorned old-school filmmaking where familiar style and technique combine to unexpectedly potent effect because of the great skill with which they've been employed."
7969,rampage-movie,Emily Yoshida,20,"I’m not terribly convinced that the overtly campy version of this film would be any better, but I’m very certain that this one is bad."
7970,moulin-rouge!-movie,Desson Thomson,90,"It's a wonderful postmodern hug of a movie, and never once do you not know you're watching a movie."
7971,saving-silverman-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"So bad in so many different ways that perhaps you should see it, as an example of the lowest slopes of the bell-shaped curve."
7972,crown-heights-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Acted with gravity, emotion and a sense of the serious issues involved by stars Lakeith Stanfield, Nnamdi Asomugha and Natalie Paul, Crown Heights deals with the intensely human factors tragic events bring into play — perseverance and despair, love and longing."
7973,metropolis-re-release-movie,David Sterritt,100,"Metropolis has a place in world history as well as in the annals of fantasy. Adolf Hitler was said to have loved it, and Lang eventually fled Germany for Hollywood when the Third Reich wanted him to run its movie industry.Few movies of any era offer so much varied food for thought, cinematically and politically. Its new restoration is a major motion-picture event."
7974,bringing-out-the-dead-movie,David Sterritt,75,Equally fascinated by the afflictions of life and the usually squandered opportunities these afford for courage and self-sacrifice.
7975,the-beach-movie,David Edelstein,30,Monumentally unimaginative.  Thumbs down!
7976,first-reformed-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,90,"The conflicts Schrader exposes are too pressing, too raw, too obvious in their own right to demand subtlety. That makes First Reformed a fascinating work of almost mixed media: Ingmar Bergman and Robert Bresson meet outraged editorial cartooning meet the it-always-builds-to-violence pulp sensibility of the movie brats. The mix is volatile, enraging, entrancing."
7977,abduction-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,10,"A fourth-rate Hollywood thriller that bungles a lot of thievery from better movies, is entirely bereft of suspense or excitement and features a leading man who absolutely, positively cannot act."
7978,killing-them-softly-movie,David Edelstein,70,"He's [Pitt] not particularly inventive - with his appraising eyes and a toothpick in his mouth, he's like Redford without the edge - but he uses his stardom cannily, to kill with softness. "
7979,the-general-1998-movie,Derek Elley,90,"Rarely has a veteran filmmaker rejuvenated his career to such startling effect as John Boorman with The General, a fresh-off-the-slab biopic of maverick Irish crime lord Martin Cahill that both challenges and entertains the audience at a variety of levels, as well as reviving the vitality of the helmer's earliest, mid-'60s pics."
7980,the-fifth-estate-movie,Peter Travers,63,The Fifth Estate is stuck running in place.
7981,happy-gilmore-movie,Brian Lowry,10,"Added together, there are about three minutes of funny material in Happy Gilmore, and pretty much all of them are in the trailer, leaving a sometimes painfully unfunny 90 minutes with which to contend."
7982,asylum-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,It's one of the year's signature film experiences.
7983,spy-kids-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,There is a whole lot to be said for fun -- especially fun that can be shared by all -- and in this regard Spy Kids saves the day.
7984,road-to-perdition-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"Mendes, in only his second feature (following the Oscar-winning ""American Beauty""), has told this surprisingly resonant story with the potent, unrelenting fatalism of a previously unknown Greek myth."
7985,fire-at-sea-movie,David Lewis,100,A mesmerizing documentary.
7986,you-instead-movie,Amy Biancolli,25,The script is as bland as they come.
7987,persecuted-movie,Neil Genzlinger,10,"This terrible attempt at a political thriller for the religious right is aimed not at Christians in general but at a certain breed of them, the kind who feel as if the rest of the world were engaged in a giant conspiracy against their interpretation of good and truth."
7988,lock-stock-and-two-smoking-barrels-movie,Mary Elizabeth Williams,30,"It's supposed to be visually exciting, but the result is more like a corpse-strewn Gap khakis ad than a triumph of technique. At least, based on the film's grainy texture and amber lighting, it's nice to know that the guy who shot every porn movie released in the '70s appears to be working again."
7989,frostnixon-movie,Claudia Puig,100,"It's hard to imagine how a film built around one-on-one interviews could be entertaining, but Frost/Nixon could not be more enthralling."
7990,all-about-steve-movie,Joanne Kaufman,10,A head-banging excuse for a comedy.
7991,the-woodsman-movie,Peter Travers,88,It's Bacon who overcomes all obstacles.
7992,autumn-lights-movie,Sheri Linden,30,American writer-director Angad Aulakh tries to agitate the pensive set-up with sex and a supposed mystery that never raises the pulse. The Bergman-esque posturing falls so far short of the Swedish master that it wouldn’t even qualify as accidental parody.
7993,ace-ventura-pet-detective-movie,Michael Sragow,10,"In this smutty kiddie farce he's a clownish action toy, and he grows wearying, fast."
7994,august-osage-county-movie,Eric Kohn,75,A distinctly uneven but imminently watchable theatrical showcase in which cinematic and stagy devices go head to head with no clear winner.
7995,fathers-day-movie,Desson Thomson,80,"Crystal’s deadpan expressions and one liners interlock perfectly with Williams’s multiple personalities and verbal asides. They’re like basketball all-stars flipping no-look passes, trading slam-dunks and practically chest-bumping each other. Director Ivan Reitman doesn’t have to do more than keep time."
7996,tale-of-tales-movie,Gregory Ellwood,83,"A slightly bumpy two hours of storytelling, but it's peppered with wonder and unexpected humor."
7997,hanna-movie,Peter Rainer,75,"Is there a moral objection to be raised about a movie that features a teenage girl as an assassin? I suppose there is, but I couldn't find it in me to object."
7998,runaway-jury-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,83,"The already heavy-footed clomp of Grisham's declamatory storytelling style has been given an extra-thick-soled, wing-tipped, liberal-leaning, reality-tampering kick thanks to a screenplay credited to four writers."
7999,inherent-vice-movie,Rodrigo Perez,83,"Big, wonderfully oddball, sometimes confounding and beautiful, Inherent Vice supplies good dosages of stoner giggles. But its doobage is potent and reflects some heavy ideas you’ll need to unpack and meditate on for a long while."
8000,the-equalizer-2-movie,Richard Roeper,75,"In The Equalizer 2 the great Denzel Washington hits a variety of notes reprising his role as McCall, in a brilliant performance that often rises above the pulpy, blood-soaked material."
8001,never-die-alone-movie,J.R. Jones,20,Bloody gangsta crap.
8002,miss-bala-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,90,"Terrifically choreographed, violent and amoral, but never wantonly cruel, Miss Bala is a knockout."
8003,did-you-hear-about-the-morgans-movie,Mike Scott,38,"Grant and Parker's talents are wasted on a boring, made-for-TV story punctuated by a contrived, throwaway third act."
8004,captain-america-civil-war-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"After the nihilistic deconstruction of Deadpool and the flattening self-importance of Batman v. Superman, Captain America: Civil War reminds you how funny and exciting these pictures can be when they’re done right — you know, like comic books. The summer movie season has barely begun, and already the remedy for superhero film fatigue has arrived."
8005,tyler-perrys-temptation-movie,Scott Foundas,30,"Significantly lacking in star wattage (including Perry’s own), this sluggish, relentlessly downbeat portrait of a young couple in crisis should play well to Perry’s fanbase."
8006,revolver-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"It is a ""thriller"" without thrills, constructed in a meaningless jumble of flashbacks and flash-forwards and subtitles and mottos and messages and scenes that are deconstructed, reconstructed and self-destructed. I wanted to signal the projectionist to put a gun to it."
8007,the-cider-house-rules-movie,Robert Horton,80,"Part of the appeal of John Irving's writing is its sense of bounty, the way the world is offered up as a horn of plenty. The Cider House Rules movie, by contrast, feels narrowed down to small slices of experience."
8008,clay-pigeons-movie,Ella Taylor,10,"If you get your jollies from watching women being shot, stabbed and humiliated, you’ll love video director David Dobkin’s pointlessly grisly, tediously derivative feature debut."
8009,one-thousand-ae-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,For the most part it is an uninteresting slog alleviated only by the occasional unintended laugh and moments of visual beauty. Mr. Shyamalan generally torpedoes his movies with overweening self-seriousness.
8010,extreme-ops-movie,Justine Elias,10,The mountain would probably recommend that you save your money.
8011,son-of-saul-movie,Scott Tobias,80,"Nemes does everything he can to connect the audience to Saul's numbness, shielding us as much as possible from the cacophony of human misery that rings in his ears. The chill seeps in regardless, as it should, and Nemes doesn't try to counter it with more than a tiny, stubborn flicker of hope."
8012,unforgettable-movie,Matt Donato,30,"Unforgettable is a ""How Not To"" guide for romantic thrillers, passionless and without tension when it comes to the conflict at hand."
8013,the-replacements-movie,Sean Means,10,"A sports movie as distinguishable as one M&M in a bag, working off a formula as easy-to-read as an onsides kick."
8014,dungeons-dragons-movie,Lisa Alspector,10,The plot somehow manages to be both hackneyed and convoluted.
8015,time-out-movie,Liam Lacey,88,Skip work to see it at the first opportunity.
8016,56-up-movie,Ty Burr,88,"The attitude of many “UP” fans hovers between voyeurism and concern, between cherishing these people as distant friends and as extensions of ourselves. They’re canaries in the coal mine of human existence."
8017,phantoms-movie,Walter Addiego,12,Godawful.
8018,kung-fu-panda-3-movie,Gary Goldstein,80,"A beautifully rendered, lovingly constructed action-comedy that's sure to please kids and adults alike."
8019,melinda-and-melinda-movie,Sheri Linden,80,Woody's back on solid ground with his first memorable pic of the new millennium.
8020,marmaduke-movie,Keith Phipps,25,"Marmaduke saves its farts for the beginning and end, but the stink carries through the whole movie."
8021,the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,100,I see it as nearly perfect: It's one of the best fantasy pictures ever made.
8022,phantoms-movie,Hazel-Dawn Dumpert,10,"Since neither (Chapelle nor Koontz) seems to have any idea as to how to make an actual movie, they abandon form and reason and throw every stock trick in the book at the screen to see what sticks. And what sticks is the murky goo of storytelling gone bad."
8023,the-punisher-movie,M. E. Russell,16,"It actually makes the 1989 version (starring Dolph Lundgren) look pretty good by comparison. Oh, yes. It's that ghastly. "
8024,500-days-of-summer-movie,Roger Ebert,100,Here is a rare movie that begins by telling us how it will end and is about how the hero has no idea why.
8025,boat-trip-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"This comedy is harmless, too, when measured against the vast array of harms that the world has to offer. It's also stupid, strident, witless, pitifully inept and bad for what ails you."
8026,chasing-papi-movie,Roger Ebert,63,"As light as a feather, as fresh as spring, and as lubricious as a centerfold... There is something extroverted and refreshing in the way these women enjoy their beauty and their sexiness."
8027,the-fast-and-the-furious-tokyo-drift-movie,Claudia Puig,38,"Has plenty of fast cars and revving engines. But unless you're a fan of that sort of thing, its stultifying plot and wooden acting is likely to make you drift - off to sleep."
8028,someone-like-you-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,"It's cheap and it's lowdown, and to those responsible for this exercise in devolution: Honestly, I'm not sure I want to know someone like you."
8029,metropolis-2002-movie,Jonathan Perry,88,"Poetic, surreal, and curiously powerful."
8030,movie-43-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,0,"Despite the filmmakers' desperate attempts to scandalize us, the only real shock is that a movie this disastrous ever managed to get made."
8031,lone-survivor-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"The film is rugged, skilled, relentless, determined, narrow-minded and focused, everything that a soldier must be when his life is on the line."
8032,beasts-of-no-nation-movie,Leah Greenblatt,100,"Cary Fukunaga’s stark, beautifully shot drama was likely never meant to be a blockbuster; its brutal account of a child soldier in an unnamed African country is far too discomfiting for wider audiences. It absolutely does belong on a big screen, though, and more important, it just deserves to be seen."
8033,swat-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"SWAT is better than ""Gigli,"" but so is most outpatient surgery."
8034,not-another-teen-movie-movie,Rita Kempley,0,"If there is a Hell, Not Another Teen Movie will be playing for all eternity on every screen there."
8035,aardvark-movie,Kristen Yoonsoo Kim,20,"Aardvark, the first feature from writer-director Brian Shoaf, is so inane that several times it put this critic into a fugue state. Meandering in message or plot, the film proves to be not just incoherent but excruciatingly boring, quite a feat with a cast that includes Jenny Slate, Jon Hamm, Sheila Vand, and, sure, Zachary Quinto."
8036,only-human-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,80,"As directors, Harari and De Pelegri have just the right light-fingered glissando touch. Not a moment sags. Their cast relishes and fulfills the tempo."
8037,the-hangover-part-ii-movie,Eric Hynes,20,"It's hard to imagine a more calculating, creatively bankrupt piece of real estate than The Hangover Part II. "
8038,trust-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,Trust never lives up to its snappy opening. Everything is tongue-in-cheek here - yet it's never remotely clear what the point is or what's getting satirized. [16 Aug 1991]
8039,the-twilight-samurai-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"This is a determined, resolutely paced, and atypical samurai movie, more an epic of the heart than of the battlefield, and all the more powerful for it. "
8040,sketches-of-frank-gehry-movie,Christopher Hawthorne,80,"Pollack does give a substantial chunk of screen time to Milton Wexler, Gehry's longtime analyst, who proves to be a winning, charismatic presence."
8041,the-business-of-fancydancing-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,38,The movie eventually chokes on its own pretensions.
8042,haywire-movie,Rex Reed,25,"Haywire makes no sense whatsoever, which should come as no surprise. It's the latest brainless exercise in self-indulgence from Steven Soderbergh, whose films rarely make any sense anyway."
8043,the-end-of-the-tour-movie,Richard Roeper,100,It’s a brilliant slice of life.
8044,dick-movie,Wesley Morris,88,Madhouse satire manages to disarm the second you realize it's laughing with you - and sometimes harder.
8045,norm-of-the-north-movie,Robert Abele,15,"Occasionally Norm and everyone around him will break out into a dance, and you have to wonder if these numbers were scheduled as bathroom breaks."
8046,an-everlasting-piece-movie,Desson Thomson,80,The movie finds charming humor in a world full of sectarian strife between Protestant and Catholic.
8047,kingsman-the-secret-service-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"Fast-paced with a morbid sense of humor and copious pop culture references, Kingsman breezes along at a nice clip until it gets a little bogged down during its final third. "
8048,little-nicky-movie,Desson Thomson,20,How much you enjoy this movie depends on how funny you find Sandler talking out the side of his mouth with a gravelly squawk -- for the entire movie.
8049,the-scribbler-movie,Brian Tallerico,38,The Scribbler never clicks into the escapist mind fk it really needed to be to work. It can't maintain its style and never finds its substance. 
8050,the-meddler-movie,Rex Reed,88,"Charming, insightful and funny, The Meddler takes familiar material (the mother from Hell and the daughter from Hunger) and infuses it with affectionate, slap-your-thigh humor. It also crowns Susan Sarandon with one of her most endearingly irresistible roles in years."
8051,silk-movie,Julia Wallace,10,"Silk isn’t just bad. It’s utterly mad. It stutters and hiccups from scene to scene, from country to country, but never once does it make narrative or emotional sense."
8052,20-dates-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,One of the downsides of living in a free society is that every so often someone like Myles Berkowitz gets hold of a camera.
8053,quills-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"Kaufman's startling Quills gives us an anatomy of fear, images both silken swift and molten hot, scenes that disrupt and inflame the imagination."
8054,orgazmo-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"The very soul of sophomorism. It is callow, gauche, obvious and awkward, and designed to appeal to those with similar qualities."
8055,seeking-a-friend-for-the-end-of-the-world-movie,Steve Persall,100,"It's more amusing than you might expect, and ultimately more touching than an eroding society around them deserves."
8056,london-has-fallen-movie,Peter Travers,0,Make American movies great again. You can start by boycotting this one.
8057,jane-eyre-movie,J.R. Jones,80,"The new version of Jane Eyre is far and away the best I've seen, thanks largely to the skilled young actress Mia Wasikowska. "
8058,i-am-sam-movie,Rita Kempley,30,Well-intentioned but ludicrous tale.
8059,sound-and-fury-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"A documentary with the emotional power of the very best in narrative film. It has characters impossible to forget, moments impossible to shake and an ending that leaves the audience both moved and rattled."
8060,night-comes-on-movie,Jared Mobarak,91,The whole therefore hinges upon Fishback’s performance and she assuredly carries it upon her shoulders.
8061,hector-and-the-search-for-happiness-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"In order to show the ""happiness"" noted in the title, director Peter Chelsom ventures into some dark territory to provide a contrast. This results in a surprisingly unpleasant scene of torture and deprivation that may shock some viewers expecting to see a lightweight Simon Pegg dramedy about the meaning of joy. "
8062,willard-movie,Stephen Holden,20,The worst flaw of Willard is a clunky tone-deaf screenplay based on Gilbert Ralston's original and updated by the director. Barely a line flies by that doesn't land with a wooden thud.
8063,the-cured-movie,Richard Whittaker,67,"It may owe much to viral shockers like ""28 Days Later,"" but its political and personal insight elevates The Cured alongside the best of contemporary European realism. "
8064,love-and-other-catastrophes-movie,Staff (Not Credited),70,"Made on a shoestring by a bunch of film school graduates (director and co-writer Croghan was 23 at the time), this sweet, brisk campus comedy has a refreshingly current feel. For once, you believe the actors are the age they're playing. The romantic musical chairs are routine, but Croghan has a light touch, and a shrewd eye for the rules of attraction. It's too unassuming to be brattily obnoxious."
8065,and-so-it-goes-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,And So It Goes appears to be targeting an audience segment that rarely goes out to the movies — while providing them a cringe-worthy incentive to never do so again.
8066,prince-avalanche-movie,Rodrigo Perez,91,"A wonderfully eccentric examination of unlikely friendships that illuminates the absurd and lovely corners of life, Prince Avalanche is a deeply enjoyable, wondrous delight."
8067,the-lord-of-the-rings-the-return-of-the-king-movie,A.O. Scott,100,"It's been a long time since a commercially oriented film with the scale of ""King"" ended with such an enduring and heartbreaking coda."
8068,the-big-bounce-movie,Manohla Dargis,30,"There may once have been a real movie rattling inside the empty studio package known as The Big Bounce, but no longer."
8069,super-troopers-2-movie,Glenn Kenny,80,"The antics never out-and-out surprise, but they almost never fail to amuse."
8070,collateral-beauty-movie,Manohla Dargis,0,"Many of the words that I would like to use to describe this waste of talent and time...can’t be lobbed in a family publication. So, instead, I will just start by throwing out some permissible insults: artificial, clichéd, mawkish, preposterous, incompetent, sexist, laughable, insulting."
8071,scary-movie-2-movie,Peter Rainer,10,"Isn't scary, funny-scary, or even just plain funny."
8072,riddick-movie,Roger Moore,38,"Like Vin Diesel, it has bulk, lumbering clumsily along as it repeats Diesel’s greatest hits — the ones that don’t require him to drive a fast and furious car."
8073,i-love-you-beth-cooper-movie,Don R. Lewis,0,"Sloppy, not funny, downright stupid, ridiculous as well as horribly themed and shot."
8074,under-the-skin-movie,Ty Burr,88,"What’s under the film’s surface is intriguing enough, but it’s the surface itself that holds you in a dark trance. A portrait of alienation filmed from the alien’s point of view — or is it just a woman’s? — the movie’s a cinematic Rubik’s Cube that snaps together surprisingly easily, yet whose larger meanings remain tantalizingly out of reach."
8075,risk-movie,Lee Marshall,80,"Sometimes all a documentary needs to do is to get us in the room with somebody we’re curious about. Laura Poitras did this, and a lot more, in Citizenfour, by taking us to meet US whistleblower Edward Snowden; she pulls off the same trick in Risk."
8076,the-kids-grow-up-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,80,"The small moments loom large in this moving, bittersweet and often funny documentary."
8077,mission-impossible-5-movie,Todd McCarthy,90,"The formula of ingredients is familiar and time-tested, to be sure, but some cocktails go down much better than others and McQuarrie and company have gotten theirs just right here."
8078,deterrence-movie,Wesley Morris,25,"Ludicrously written and appallingly directed by ex-film critic Rod Lurie, seems to pride itself on the fact that it never (ever) leaves the greasy-spoon milieu in which the president and his staff are trapped by heavy snowfall."
8079,extinction-2018-movie,Randall Colburn,25,"While the script is fundamentally flawed, the direction doesn’t help. Young, who previously helmed the brutal 2016 indie Hounds of Love, feels out of his element in the sci-fi action realm."
8080,detroit-movie,Ty Burr,75,"Lines are drawn and connections are made. The intentions are pure. The results are enraging, often in accordance with the filmmakers’ hopes, sometimes against. Personally, I came out of Detroit angrier than I’ve been at a movie in ages, and not entirely the way director Kathryn Bigelow probably wants."
8081,iron-monkey-movie,Bob Graham,100,"Where it really counts, though, it's the same good old comic action fantasy."
8082,bad-influence-movie,Peter Travers,63,"Bad Influence will do in a pinch if you're starved for intrigue. For a while, it's nasty fun watching Michael sink into depravity. Erotic and spine tingling, this thriller has undeniable allure. But Bad Influence lacks daring, moral ambiguity and the pleasures of the unexpected, the elements that might give it distinction."
8083,last-days-in-vietnam-movie,Mark Feeney,88,At once riveting and heartbreaking. This youngest daughter of Robert F. Kennedy has the good sense — far rarer among documentarians than you’d like to think — not to get in the way of her material. 
8084,where-the-wild-things-are-movie,Scott Foundas,100,"What he’s (Jonze) ended up with strikes me as one of the most empathic and psychologically acute of all movies about childhood -- a ""Wizard of Oz"" for the dysfunctional-family era."
8085,the-bank-job-movie,Desson Thomson,70,What makes director Roger Donaldson's movie greater than zany heist fare is that this particular robbery really happened and that this episode illuminated an almost moral clash between the haves and the have-nots of Great Britain.
8086,elizabethtown-movie,William Arnold,91,"That rare animal, a dialogue-driven comedy -- and a good one at that. While one or two of its scenes may seem a tad too talky for today's low-attention spans, the script is mostly razor-sharp acerbic and sophisticated."
8087,just-married-movie,John Petrakis,25,"Just Married is what industry people refer to as ""January Junk,"" cinematic flotsam that gets tossed ashore once they have cleared the shelves of Oscar contenders."
8088,austin-powers-in-goldmember-movie,Shawn Levy,83,You go into an Austin Powers movie with a big grin on -- or at least you should. The charm of this one is that you leave smiling even more broadly.
8089,a-dogs-purpose-movie,Jude Dry,0,"What is the meaning of life? Are we here for a reason? Is there a point to any of this? We may never know, but knowing this movie exists may bring some viewers one step closer to giving up on the whole damn thing."
8090,just-go-with-it-movie,Dana Stevens,0,"A comedy so noxious it seems the product of deliberate malignity. Surely the sour, vapid, miserable world of this movie can't reflect any real human being's notion of what love or humor or good storytelling is-not even a Hollywood screenwriter's. "
8091,thunder-soul-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,89,Music has rarely appeared more essential to the human drama.
8092,siberia-movie,Jake Cole,25,"The film has the tone and look of a direct-to-video feature, and some shots of Keanu Reeves are so waxen that the actor almost looks rotoscoped."
8093,shanghai-calling-movie,Andy Webster,70,"Though Mr. Hsia, a television alumnus who also wrote the script, has created a somewhat predictable story infused with stereotypes old and new, he gains mileage from light humor, buoyant energy and some appealing performers."
8094,st-vincent-movie,Steve Persall,75,"This is first and foremost Murray's show, and the shortcomings in Melfi's script and direction are strangely appreciated. They give this singular comedian, who doesn't do it often enough these days, the room to let his buffalo heart roam."
8095,laws-of-attraction-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,This shabby enterprise gets so many things so wrong that it freezes your face into a cringe.
8096,nerve-movie,Odie Henderson,75,"Nerve wants to be a cautionary tale about the perils of desiring fame through social media, but it isn’t willing to go to the darker depths this material requires. It opts to stay on a more superficial and very goofy level, and while that has its enjoyable charms, it pretty much negates the film’s message. "
8097,entanglement-movie,Michael Upchurch,63,"The script isn’t great, but the plot turns and visuals can be striking, and Jess Weixler has fun as the bad-girl sister Ben finds."
8098,one-for-the-money-movie,Nick Schager,20,"Flirty bickering is rampant but, courtesy of Heigl's inert performance, there's no heat or humor to the proceedings, just an avalanche of grating big-hair-and-bad-accent New Joisey caricatures."
8099,josie-and-the-pussycats-movie,Rita Kempley,10,The fat cats of Hollywood have coughed up a hairball.
8100,leaning-into-the-wind-andy-goldsworthy-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,90,"The film ranges more widely than its predecessor, surveying more landscapes and a greater variety of projects. But it’s still a contemplative beauty, a chance to consider and be moved by a richer sort of connectedness than our lives typically allow."
8101,world-trade-center-movie,Aaron Hillis,63,"Underscored by the fragility of a plinking piano and well-timed flourishes to uplift, this heroic heartstring-tugger is still frequently and unexpectedly affecting, so much that it's able to hide its true face as a glorified movie-of-the-week."
8102,the-perfect-family-movie,Ernest Hardy,30,Renton's competing tones and intentions result in a film at odds with itself and its lead performance.
8103,eastern-promises-movie,Sura Wood,90,Cronenberg and screenwriter Steve Knight masterfully orchestrate an atmosphere of danger and dread for a descent into an underworld inhabited by the Russian mafia in London.
8104,kumiko-the-treasure-hunter-movie,Betsy Sharkey,80,"Though it might not sound it, watching Kumiko brood is mesmerizing. Kikuchi uses her mournful eyes to take us to dark places, though she's equally adept at surprise and confusion, even joy when it comes along."
8105,a-hijacking-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,100,"Rarely leaning on the weepy families back home, this briskly paced triumph maintains a clear focus on human costs, with hope slipping away onboard while lives hang on the burp of a fax machine. "
8106,the-last-airbender-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"If M. Night Shyamalan sold his soul to the devil for the success of ""The Sixth Sense,"" I think His Satanic Majesty has finally collected in full with The Last Airbender."
8107,the-jacket-movie,Carla Meyer,25,"[Brody's] mannered performance helps downgrade this picture from a middling sci-fi film to a bad, borderline-camp sci-fi film."
8108,hotel-for-dogs-movie,Andrea Gronvall,70,"A bright, funny family movie that gets everything right, from story to production design to cast (both human and canine)."
8109,little-boy-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"Director Monteverde, whose previous feature, ""Bella,"" came out nine years ago, clearly meant his film to lift up everyone and condescend to no one, least of all Pepper and Hashimoto. But Little Boy comes off as a picture-postcard fake."
8110,sol-lewitt-movie,A.O. Scott,80,"The on-camera absence of its subject and its overall indifference to matters of biography make Sol LeWitt a welcome departure from most documentaries about artists, as well as a fitting and serious tribute to his art."
8111,va-savoir-who-knows-movie,Michael Sragow,75,"You may find Va Savoir pleasant to sit through, but will it stay with you the next morning? Who knows?"
8112,the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn---part-2-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,38,"For those with no vested interest in this protracted and supernatural soap opera, but who do care about cinema, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 will be, unsurprisingly, a silly and somewhat cheesily made waste of time."
8113,the-end-of-the-affair-movie,David Edelstein,70,A religious conspiracy disguised as a romance.
8114,the-brave-one-movie,Peter Rainer,33,"The end result, at best, is high-toned pulp."
8115,the-kid-stays-in-the-picture-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,A candy store for film buffs.
8116,bride-wars-movie,James Berardinelli,38,"It represents a missed opportunity on every level. As a black comedy, it fails. As a satire of the bloated wedding industry, it fails. As a drama about friendship triumphing over all, it fails."
8117,howls-moving-castle-movie,Ken Tucker,90,"In the best moments of Howl's Moving Castle and in his extraordinary body of work, Miyazaki teaches his viewers more valuable lessons."
8118,the-blind-side-movie,Mike Scott,75,"One of the reasons it's so effective is because it's based on a real-life, odds-defying story: that of mountainous Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron)."
8119,golden-exits-movie,Anthony Kaufman,70,"Golden Exits is an idiosyncratic film about little moments of human pain and loneliness. There’s jealousy, sadness, unfulfilled loves and lives, all of it relayed in quiet conversations and glances, rather than big dramatic scenes."
8120,four-brothers-movie,Michael Phillips,63,Proficiently made trash.
8121,a-history-of-violence-movie,Maitland McDonagh,88,"For all the bloodshed, it's fundamentally a cold, cold fable, the icy whisper that turns every happy thing to ash."
8122,pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-mans-chest-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,More than the usual bad or even numbingly horrible movie. It's an amalgam of many of the modern cinema's worst tendencies and modern filmmaking's most unfortunate misconceptions.
8123,skyline-movie,Megan Lehmann,30,"Beyond the dazzling ""first contact"" sequences seen in the trailers, Skyline is a spasmodic and incoherent shambles hampered by an astoundingly stupid screenplay."
8124,the-skulls-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,38,"When it comes to being brainless, The Skulls is at the head of the class."
8125,mad-max-fury-road-movie,Justin Chang,100,"There is gargantuan excess here, to be sure — and no shortage of madness — but there is also an astonishing level of discipline."
8126,merchants-of-doubt-movie,Steven Rea,88,Merchants of Doubt shouldn't be a hard sell. The fact that it is should make you very mad.
8127,the-in-crowd-movie,Moira Macdonald,10,Silly teen thriller.
8128,rain-movie,Manohla Dargis,70,"Jeffs' meticulous framing nicely counterpoints all the messy turmoil, and her screenplay flows with the cadences of life -- its awkward eruptions and long, hurtful silences -- but she never pulls you deep enough into her characters."
8129,the-dreamers-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,80,"The Dreamers is a real humdinger, at once an intimate romance, a glimpse into a rather unconventional friendship and a beautifully focused celebration of cinema itself."
8130,flirt-movie,Kevin Thomas,80,There's a beguiling throwaway quality to Flirt that has the effect of making it stick with you.
8131,48-hrs-movie,Dave Kehr,70,"The film is still an entertaining and invigorating thriller, with a structure and some curious sexual overtones that suggest Howard Hawks's ""A Girl in Every Port."""
8132,hell-ride-movie,John Anderson,0,"After all the bloated lines are delivered, and dozens of women are debased, and Bishop has attitudinized the story line into incomprehensibility, audience members will be asking themselves how they got on this Hell Ride and what they did to deserve it."
8133,smiling-fish-goat-on-fire-movie,Kevin Maynard,10,Strives for folksy charm but ends up just lying there like a plate of kippers.
8134,rambo-first-blood-part-ii-movie,Staff (Not Credited),25,"All in all, it's a pretty offensive movie, especially to the Americans who fought in Vietnam."
8135,bride-wars-movie,Sean Axmaker,25,A girlie romantic comedy with tired slapstick pranks but not an ounce of self-respect or intelligence.
8136,frostnixon-movie,Philip Kennicott,80,Neither the title nor the subject matter prepares you for the pure fun of Frost/Nixon.
8137,unfinished-business-movie,Drew Taylor,0,Unfinished Business is the type of movie that is so awful that as it rolls along (its 91-minute runtime feels agonizing) you get more and more restless.
8138,the-ice-harvest-movie,Neva Chonin,25,What a waste.
8139,untraceable-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"As plain awful as Untraceable is, possibly the worst thing about it is that it pretends to mean something."
8140,ip-man-2-movie,Roger Ebert,75,A reminder of the pleasure of classic martial-arts films in which skilled athletes performed many of their own stunts.
8141,my-favorite-martian-movie,Marc Savlov,20,Petrie (Richie Rich) has crafted a snuffling dog of a comedy that's far too reliant on less-than-amazing CGI effects.
8142,ghosts-of-the-abyss-movie,Kimberley Jones,67,It’s best to situate yourself in the middle of the row; a seat at the end will most likely leave you feeling cross-eyed for an hour.
8143,ghostbusters-2016-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,80,It turns out it’s okay to cross streams: Here’s a summer movie starring a girl squad proud of its big brains and tacky jumpsuits. You could call that a supernatural event in itself.
8144,the-big-short-movie,Melissa Anderson,10,McKay's bumptious movie awkwardly combines fourth-wall-breaking gimmickry and flaccid indignation with the goofball energy that defines his comedies.
8145,king-arthur-legend-of-the-sword-movie,Peter Travers,25,"An epic bore that believes if you make a movie long and loud and repetitive enough, audiences will conclude it's saying something profound. Wrong."
8146,the-white-ribbon-movie,Keith Phipps,100,Haneke’s latest is essentially an inquiry into the roots of a certain kind of evil.
8147,dear-frankie-movie,Lawrence Toppman,75,"The movie has been shot with love and wisdom, and its implausible premise doesn't get in the way of a sweetness and honesty too rarely seen."
8148,ben-hur-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,Bekmambetov and Co. have created a redesigned product that is at once inferior to the original and a slavish imitation.
8149,dogville-movie,David Edelstein,10,"The politics of Dogville are on par with a third-rate gangster picture: cheap, opportunistic nihilism, with no enlivening sense of humor. "
8150,wordplay-movie,Claudia Puig,88,"If it's challenges you're after, forget cracking ""The Da Vinci Code."" Wordplay captures the exhilaration that comes from navigating the ins and outs of complex puzzles."
8151,faceoff-movie,Desson Thomson,90,"A delirious mixture of spectacular gun battles, furious explosions and breathtaking stunt work, it's also one of the strangest stories to ever get the green light at a Hollywood studio. You have to take your hat off to Paramount Studios for allowing such inspired weirdness to see the light of day."
8152,the-ladies-man-movie,John Petrakis,38,"Not without its humorous moments, but they are too few and far between."
8153,the-worlds-fastest-indian-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"Sometimes shticky biopic overcomes its cornball conventionality to become a genial entertainment, thanks to Anthony Hopkins' exceptionally engaging performance."
8154,sound-of-my-voice-movie,Mary Pols,70,"The movie explores the basic debate over faith, the idea that we can feel a sense of relief in cynicism realized and turn around and face the horror of our lack of faith in the next moment."
8155,hellboy-ii-the-golden-army-movie,Ann Hornaday,90,"As he has done in all his movies, from creature features such as ""Mimic"" to serious dramas such as ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" del Toro creates unforgettable images, filled with color, texture, lyricism and horror."
8156,rugrats-go-wild-movie,Staff (Not credited),30,"This frantic sequel finds the diaper-obsessed heroes and their foolish parents marooned on a desert island, where they encounter the family from a more charming Nickelodeon cartoon."
8157,the-love-guru-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,Offensive to Hindus. Never mind the Hindus; The Love Guru is offensive to pretty much anyone with a brain.
8158,foxtrot-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,100,Maoz is as good at youthful languor as he is at the process of grief. This middle section of the film abounds with insights and moments of surprising desert beauty.
8159,the-boy-movie,Roger Moore,25,Is it a spoiler to refer to the coda of thriller The Boy as the clumsiest cop out in recent horror history?
8160,romeo-juliet-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Rarely do two lines go by without Fellowes changing something, always for the worse. "
8161,coherence-movie,Sara Stewart,75,"Writer/director James Ward Byrkit, in his feature debut, achieves effective chills with only eight actors and a living room, intermixing quantum physics (shout-outs range from Schrödinger’s cat to “Sliding Doors”) with the very mundane human tendency toward bad judgment calls in a crisis."
8162,sweet-november-movie,Kevin Maynard,30,"This is one of those movies in which there are only two types of people: officious yuppie pricks, and the beautiful folks who stop and smell the daisies. What keeps it (barely) from being completely intolerable is Keanu Reeves' hilariously awful lead performance."
8163,need-for-speed-movie,Jen Chaney,37,Need for Speed is a piece of auto-collision pornography that weighs down its car-flip-and-massive-fireball money shots with a preposterous plot involving vehicular manslaughter vengeance.
8164,grown-ups-movie,Joe Williams,38,"Nobody escapes unscathed, except, of course, for Sandler, who co-wrote the infantile screenplay."
8165,girls-cant-swim-movie,V.A. Musetto,75,"It includes abundant sex and full-frontal nudity, not to titillate but because it's needed to convey the inner sexual turmoil the girls are going through."
8166,mr-magoo-movie,Peter Stack,25,Only a couple of good gags in its pileup of otherwise lame jokes keep the production from being an unqualified stinker. 
8167,i-dreamed-of-africa-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,25,Here's hoping your own dreams of Africa are more interesting -- and better acted -- than this movie.
8168,veronica-guerin-movie,Dana Stevens,30,"The end titles and the ones that introduce Veronica Guerin...are the most informative parts of the film, and also the most powerful. What comes between them is a flat-footed, overwrought crusader-against-evil melodrama, in which Ms. Blanchett's formidable gifts as an actress are reduced to a haircut and an accent."
8169,woman-on-top-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,30,Just a string of cute gags and pouting on Isabella's part that's supposed to signify soul-searching.
8170,garfield-a-tail-of-two-kitties-movie,Marrit Ingman,0,"A Tail of Two Kitties couldn't care less about its human principals, and all it wants its animals to do is air-guitar to ""Cat Scratch Fever"" and wear silly sunglasses."
8171,only-yesterday-1991-movie,Michael Snydel,100,"Only Yesterday is unabashedly modest, but in its twin dialogues between the past and the present, and the undying lure of the country and the city, it’s a singularly specific story whose message echoes decades later."
8172,underworld-blood-wars-movie,Chuck Wilson,30,"Menzies should be just the spark to bring Underworld back to life, but it doesn’t happen. Screenwriter Cory Goodman (The Last Witch Hunter) isolates Marius from Selene and the other major players so that Menzies is left adrift, like a great fighter without a worthy sparring partner."
8173,pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales-movie,Rodrigo Perez,33,"The film is not unlike a classic rock supergroup reuniting to play all the greatest hits, with the payday at the end as the only true motivation, rather than returning with something new to say about their work."
8174,secret-window-movie,A.O. Scott,30,This movie is a suspense thriller whose only suspense comes from an audience wondering if the picture will hit its promised 97-minute running time.
8175,excess-baggage-movie,Desson Thomson,10,This one's for Silverstone fans only.
8176,jurassic-park-iii-movie,Carrie Rickey,38,"Has to be the sorriest excuse for a reprise since ""Highlander — The Final Dimension."""
8177,the-lazarus-effect-movie,Drew Taylor,16,"Bringing someone back from the dead is one of the horror genre's oldest and most effective tropes, but with The Lazarus Effect, it just seems tired."
8178,biker-boyz-movie,Michael Sragow,38,However you pronounce Bythewood -- I assume it's by-the-wood -- his work here is strictly by the numbers.
8179,summer-school-movie,Roger Ebert,12,"A comedy so listless, leisurely and unspirited that it was an act of the will for me to care about it, even while I was watching it."
8180,other-peoples-children-movie,Abbey Bender,30,Nothing ever feels like it's at stake — the drama here is whisper-thin.
8181,the-tourist-movie,Peter Travers,0,"In a year of craptaculars, The Tourist deserves burial at the bottom of the 2010 dung heap. It offers talented people trapped in creative inertia. A microscope and a search party could not discover any trace of chemistry between Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie. "
8182,fred-claus-movie,Kyle Smith,12,Not like a lump of coal in your stocking. Coal is useful; you can burn it. This movie is more like a lump of something Blitzen left behind after eating a lot of Mexican food.
8183,after-auschwitz-movie,Gary Thompson,100,"Kean inherited these subjects from his earlier documentary Swimming in Auschwitz, and has said that gender informs the film – the women are particularly attuned to the emotional nuance of the survival story, which comes through beautifully."
8184,fruitvale-station-movie,Mike Scott,100,Fruitvale Station is only the first in a string of civil-rights minded movies set to hit theaters this year -- contributing to what could be the most racially conscious award season in recent memory.
8185,hands-of-stone-movie,Will Ashton,33,"An unsavory, underdeveloped and uninspired bore, it takes too many blows and doesn’t give nearly enough counterpunches. It doesn’t cut. It doesn’t bleed. It doesn’t even hit. Hell, it barely puts up a fight. It comes out the gate frail and disoriented, already down for the count before the picture has started."
8186,son-of-the-mask-movie,Scott Tobias,0,"No doubt extensive market research shows that there's an audience out there for movies like Son Of The Mask, but it's too depressing to speculate who that might be."
8187,a-good-old-fashioned-orgy-movie,Michael Phillips,0,"A Good Old-Fashioned Orgy isn't just not funny, it's totally just not funny."
8188,the-transporter-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"That the movie becomes silly isn't necessarily a problem, but it also becomes tiresome, degenerating into a series of martial arts interludes -- everyone unaccountably leaves his guns at home."
8189,say-it-isnt-so-movie,F. X. Feeney,20,"The humor stays on one low level throughout, and thus fades fast."
8190,alex-emma-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,"Astonishingly dull. The leads have zero chemistry, the supporting actors are even worse, and the script is a lifeless, draggy thing."
8191,drift-2013-movie,Tomas Hachard,12,The obstacles that the Kelly brothers encounter are as uninspired as the film's treacly lessons about brotherhood and staying true to one's principles.
8192,blackhat-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,88,"Slick and sometimes goofy as it is, Blackhat is an odd, fascinating movie: a high-tech action thriller about the human condition. I can think of no better current illustration of the notion that, to quote this site's founder, it's not what a movie is about, it's how it's about it."
8193,the-greatest-movie-ever-sold-movie,Justin Chang,70,A consistently amusing and not entirely vacuous stunt. 
8194,sweeney-todd-the-demon-barber-of-fleet-street-movie,A.O. Scott,100,"Something close to a masterpiece, a work of extreme -- I am tempted to say evil -- genius."
8195,spy-kids-3-d-game-over-movie,Jami Bernard,63,"Stay through to the end credits, where the two child protagonists (Sabara and Vega) are shown as they were then and as they are now. Rodriguez's best achievement is in spotting the innate talent that would shine through in those two kids. "
8196,risk-movie,John Semley,88,"There’s no doubt that the world needs more iconoclasts, whistle-blowers and anti-authoritarian rabble-rousers. But it deserves better than Julian Assange."
8197,extreme-ops-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"Dude, one last thing: If you see my moms and pops, definitely don't tell them about this."
8198,julia-movie,Noel Murray,91,"In tone and plot, Julia often resembles an extended episode of the AMC series ""Breaking Bad""--except that Swinton's character is never NOT bad."
8199,september-dawn-movie,Roger Ebert,0,"What a strange, confused, unpleasant movie this is. Two theories have clustered around it: (1) It is anti-Mormon propaganda to muddy the waters around the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, or (2) it is not about Mormons at all, but an allegory about the 9/11/01 terrorists. Take your choice. The problem with allegories is that you can plug them in anywhere. No doubt the film would have great impact in Darfur."
8200,wont-you-be-my-neighbor-movie,David Sims,65,"The film is touching, sometimes saccharine, and other times bluntly honest, but it works best as a fascinating reminder that Rogers was trying to be more than a mascot of American politeness."
8201,daughter-from-danang-movie,Marrit Ingman,89,"Honest and unflinching, Daughter From Danang isn't always pleasant to watch, but it is powerful and memorable."
8202,the-last-house-on-the-left-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,One sickening piece of garbage.
8203,couples-retreat-movie,Mark Jenkins,35,"First-time feature director Peter Billingsley could have enlivened the action with more vigorous editing. Everything takes too long, and the slapstick sequences are particularly lethargic."
8204,party-girl-movie,Peter Travers,75,"What makes it delicious fun is Posey, a party girl for the ages."
8205,resident-evil-movie,Loren King,25,A video game cum movie that substitutes shrieking decibel levels for a coherent plot and any resemblance to originality.
8206,stir-of-echoes-movie,Tom Keogh,80,It certainly has a place among the year's more accomplished productions.
8207,casanova-movie,Dana Stevens,70,"In any case, what is on screen is a delightful respite from awards-season seriousness - a feather film, you might say, that actually tickles."
8208,the-last-airbender-movie,Roger Ebert,12,The Last Airbender is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented.
8209,gullivers-travels-movie,James Berardinelli,38,The only arena in which Gulliver's Travels plays an adequate game is in visual effects. 
8210,vanilla-sky-movie,David Edelstein,30,It's no wonder that Crowe can't generate any real feeling. The narrative is alien to him on every level. The ear-grating dialogue is a good indication that he didn't know what he was doing; he's usually pitch-perfect.
8211,dear-white-people-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"This is an important movie, but it’s not a perfect one. It has one enormous flaw, and it’s a testament to the smartness of the writing and the inherent fascination of its viewpoint that it doesn’t wreck the experience: Director Justin Simien doesn’t know how to shape scenes or pull performances from his actors. "
8212,night-moves-movie,A.A. Dowd ,75,"There’s a certain muddled ambivalence to the movie; one gets the impression that Reichardt is more interested in these people than their ideas, but she never quite cracks Josh, who’s much more impenetrably aloof than the beleaguered travelers of ""Meek’s Cutoff"", her masterpiece. Night Moves is a portrait of outsiders that leaves its audience on the outside."
8213,the-leopard-re-release-movie,Kevin Thomas,100,The film is a glittering triumph of personal expression at its most elegant and opulent.
8214,tim-and-erics-billion-dollar-movie-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"Appearances from Jeff Goldblum, Zach Galifianakis and John C. Reilly help some, but all the mincing from Heidecker and Wareheim, the wanna-be, gross-out humor and THE CONSTANT SCREAMING get tiring."
8215,julia-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"Charles Bukowski would have loved this foul-mouthed, fiery, reckless woman. Against all odds and common sense, you will, too."
8216,the-sorcerers-apprentice-movie,Cliff Doerksen,70,"The tone is both goofier and darker than the Potter pictures, and some of the magic battles built around New York City landmarks are eye-popping; there's also a genuinely affecting romance between Baruchel and fetching newcomer Teresa Palmer."
8217,coyote-ugly-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,It's amazing how far a movie can go on nothing but speed and directness.
8218,the-wedding-movie,Calum Marsh,0,"Many Hollywood films are founded on privilege, but few are as open and nasty about their racism, misogyny, and homophobia."
8219,stir-of-echoes-movie,Ella Taylor,70,The ghost story is not half as satisfying as the lovely indie mood piece tucked inside it about a community tending to itself in the wake of a recent wound.
8220,snake-eyes-movie,Rick Groen,63,"Great pictures are seamless; in this one, you can not only see the seams but count the stitches."
8221,the-son-movie,Dana Stevens,90,"To call The Son a masterpiece would be to insult its modesty. Like the homely, useful boxes Olivier teaches his prodigals to build, it is sturdy, durable and, in its downcast, unobtrusive way, miraculous."
8222,abandon-movie,Megan Lehmann,12,A confusing mishmash.
8223,new-in-town-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"It's unfunny at best and borderline-amateur at worst, notwithstanding the desperate efforts of Renée Zellweger."
8224,clerks-ii-movie,Scott Foundas,70,"This is the umpteenth movie I’ve seen this year about guys in their 30s who aren't quite sure what they want to do with their lives, and it's the only one that strikes a real chord, because it's neither an exaltation nor a condemnation of slackerdom, but rather just a sweet little fable about how sometimes the life that you think could be so much better is actually pretty damn good already."
8225,mighty-aphrodite-movie,James Berardinelli,75,Allen appears determined to craft a motion picture that can be laughed at without plumbing any especially deep neuroses of the human condition.
8226,101-dalmatians-movie,Anthony Lane,10,"But by the end, the charm and delicacy of the 1961 cartoon have long been replaced by laborious gross-outs. Is this now official Disney policy?"
8227,hanna-movie,Rex Reed,25,"Contrived, pretentious and not worth seeing even for the perverse pleasure of watching first-rate talents make second-rate fools of themselves. "
8228,the-nutcracker-movie,David Edelstein,10,"Even if the film were well done, it would still be a travesty. "
8229,bad-education-movie,Jonathan Holland,90,"Superbly orchestrated, visually impressive."
8230,r2pc-road-to-park-city-movie,Jonathan Foreman,12,"A pointless, wincingly snide exercise."
8231,blade-runner-2049-movie,Peter Travers,88,"For Blade Runner junkies like myself, who've mainlined five different versions of Ridley Scott's now iconic sci-fi film noir – from the release print to the Director's Cut and the Final Cut (the last two minus that voiceover Scott and Ford hated) – every minute of this mesmerizing mindbender is a visual feast to gorge on."
8232,tears-of-the-sun-movie,Michael Atkinson,20,"This ""Black Hawk Down"" theft is a trial by cliché until the climax, which suggests a dress rehearsal for the torching of Baghdad."
8233,daughters-of-the-dust-movie,Rick Groen,88,"Daughters of the Dust is hypnotic, flowing with the trance-like rhythms of a poem that is beautifully written yet deliberately arcane. It's the cinematic equivalent of the voices you hear in the fiction of Toni Morrison or Alice Walker, but without the connecting narrative thread that most novels possess and most movies imitate. The result is a difficult work, yet a haunting one. [29 May 1992]"
8234,amelia-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"Tis embalmed drama is a ghost from the '80s, a decade that regularly produced surprise-free, caramelized biopics. The airless Amelia is missing practically everything."
8235,shallow-hal-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"What they've done here goes beyond gross -- or clumsy, or dumb -- to genuine ugliness, both cutaneous and sub."
8236,roman-polanski-wanted-and-desired-movie,Michael Phillips,100,"This is a superb picture, sharp, open-minded, wised-up and cinematically accomplished."
8237,the-lovers-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,30,"[An] inert, exasperatingly proportioned phantasmagoria from Roland Joffé."
8238,moulin-rouge!-movie,David Sterritt,75,Some will find it exhilarating fun.
8239,rear-window-movie,Staff (Not Credited),90,"Quite aside from the violation of intimacy, which is shocking enough, Hitchcock has nowhere else come so close to pure misanthropy, nor given us so disturbing a definition of what it is to watch the 'silent film' of other people's lives, whether across a courtyard or up on a screen."
8240,my-friend-dahmer-movie,Jared Mobarak,33,"If we’re not supposed to pity Dahmer while watching the unfortunate progression of his sad life, why are we watching? Is it to reinforce the notion that he was always a monster? Or is it to forgive Derf (Alex Wolff) and his buds for assisting in his descent? In the end it really doesn’t matter because we don’t buy any of it."
8241,road-trip-movie,Lawrence Toppman,88,"Grosser than ""American Pie""!  More penis jokes than ""There''s Something About Mary""!  Nudity more gratuitous than ""Porky''s""!"
8242,whipped-movie,Joe Leydon,10,"Grotesquely smutty and obnoxiously overbearing, this is a pitiful excuse for a comedy."
8243,love-1969-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,100,"This is an unforgettable love story set at the close of day, as tragic and beautiful in its way as ""Tristan und Isolde,"" and a portrait of the impossible beauty and fragility of life that will yield new experiences to every viewer and every viewing."
8244,black-mass-movie,Peter Bradshaw,80,"Scott Cooper’s Black Mass is a big, brash, horribly watchable gangster picture taken from an extraordinary true story and conceived on familiar generic lines."
8245,ai-weiwei-never-sorry-movie,Mark Jenkins,85,"Ai is a great movie subject for many reasons, but one is that he understands the power of appearing larger than life on the silver screen. "
8246,the-pink-panther-movie,Steve Davis,0,"Ultimately, one has to chalk up The Pink Panther to the good old traditions of Hollywood greed and chutzpah. Nothing this slapdash and badly executed is done for the love of movies."
8247,mountain-2018-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,90,"Awe-inspiring visuals and equally stirring orchestrations combine to fittingly majestic effect in Mountain, a unique portrait of mankind's enduring fascination with the world's most formidable summits."
8248,fair-game-movie,Liam Lacey,12,The film is significantly inept even when Crawford is not on the screen. [03 Nov 1995]
8249,coyote-ugly-movie,Robert Horton,20,It probably helps to be loaded while you're watching this movie.
8250,apollo-13-movie,Rick Groen,88,"The direction may not be flashy, but it is controlled and confident; the frames unfold with a no-nonsense, nuts-and-bolts realism that, in this era of laser-blazing Batplanes, seems downright welcome."
8251,syriana-movie,David Edelstein,70,"A grim, twisty international conspiracy picture that challenges the audience on every level, political and aesthetic. The aesthetic part is a bit of an obstacle, though. I can't remember a time I had as much trouble--at a movie I admired--just figuring out what the hell was going on."
8252,hereafter-movie,Joe Morgenstern,30,"Either you buy their Vaseline-lensed visions of the hereafter, or you watch in stony silence, as I did, wondering why there's no one to care about."
8253,the-favor-1994-movie,Kevin Thomas,70,"The Favor is a pleasant romantic comedy, aimed at thirtysomethings and younger, and it affords solid roles for Harley Jane Kozak and Elizabeth McGovern. [29 Apr 1994]"
8254,antwone-fisher-movie,William Arnold,83,"Washington brings it off with an unforced and well-earned emotional wallop, and whose strong hand, keen eye, sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene."
8255,shine-a-light-movie,Kyle Smith,75,"Martin Scorsese's Rolling Stones ""documentary"" (i.e. concert film) is a first: the only Scorsese film that does not feature the Stones' ""Gimme Shelter."" Really. I think the Dalai Lama even hummed the guitar solo in ""Kundun."""
8256,the-emperors-new-clothes-movie,William Arnold,67,"The film's European locations, sets (in Rome's Cinecitta studios) and photography are unusually striking; Rachel Portman contributes an elegant score; and Holm (who played the emperor once before in 1981's ""Time Bandits"") embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma."
8257,show-dogs-movie,Pat Padua,63,"Grown-ups might not roll over for Show Dogs, but children almost surely will. With its fart jokes and smart-alecky canines, this talking-animal comedy is aimed at a young audience anyway. For dog-loving adults, well, it’s just engaging enough to make them prick up their ears."
8258,8mm-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,0,"Almost as degrading as any unmarked video you can buy in the back alleys of Manila, and, in its pseudo-significance and arty pretension, it's a lot less honest. I'm heartily sorry I had to poison an entire evening with it."
8259,new-years-eve-movie,Ann Hornaday,25,"Behind all the noisemakers and funny glasses, New Year's Eve - and everyone in it - is dead behind the eyes."
8260,son-of-saul-movie,Chris Nashawaty,100,It’s the rarest kind of moviegoing experience: an absolute masterpiece.
8261,naqoyqatsi-movie,Laura Sinagra,30,"Despite some rocking bombast by Philip Glass and reliably wicked cello saws from Yo-Yo Ma, the whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad."
8262,sunshine-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"Despite the efforts of the cast (Byrne and Murphy are particularly good), you rarely feel a thing for any of them, but I don't think you're really supposed to, anyway. The characters in Sunshine tackle thorny ethical questions and debate the sanctity of life on their way to the sun, but the movie is really about the voyage, not the voyagers. Enjoy the sights."
8263,charlies-angels-full-throttle-movie,Michael Sragow,25,"Isn't a full-bodied comedy, and it isn't a bona fide action movie, either. It just makes a facetious spectacle of itself."
8264,collateral-beauty-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,30,"Collateral Beauty is ultimately as mushy a movie as the phrase itself, whose definition is never fully explained by the script. It’s another example of something sounding good but meaning little."
8265,gentlemen-broncos-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,"The audience may have bought the act in ""Napoleon Dynamite."" But this time, the act bombs."
8266,where-hope-grows-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,"The Christian-themed Where Hope Grows wears its heart on its sleeve, hawking its message of salvation through faith to anyone who’s in the market for cheesy uplift and saccharine sentiment. It’s a soft sell, to be sure, but it’s salesmanship all the same."
8267,the-five-year-engagement-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,"For the most part, The Five-Year Engagement has charm and emotion."
8268,agent-cody-banks-movie,David Sterritt,25,The repetitious script -- cobbled together by no fewer than five writers -- shows interest in nothing beyond action-centered plot gimmicks and tame romantic shenanigans.
8269,monster-in-law-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,"The movie itself is grotesque, and may drive you nuts as it makes you laugh, mostly at the stupidity of the thing."
8270,micmacs-movie,Steve Persall,91,"Quirky to the brink of exhaustion, the latest from Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a live-action Looney Tune complete with Acme contraptions and wily coyotes."
8271,porkys-movie,Michael Blowen,0,"Unfortunately, except for one raucous routine, this ""Animal House"" clone is an overblown, over-publicized, overwrought exploitation flick that's about as funny as the first dirty joke my father told me. [09 Apr 1982]"
8272,captain-corellis-mandolin-movie,Frank Lovece,80,"The able cast brings these emotionally complex characters to life, while making Shawn Slovo's occasionally lyrical dialogue sound perfectly natural."
8273,domestic-disturbance-movie,Michael Atkinson,10,"As the basest form of genre hootenanny, it wimps out: There's no twist, no showboat acting, not even an outrageous crisis of paternal violence."
8274,the-graduate-movie,Alison Macor,89,"Hoffman and Bancroft are phenomenally cast in a script co-written by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham that is by turns sly, touching, and amazingly fresh 30 years later. [Review of re-release]"
8275,the-judge-movie,Chris Cabin,12,"One long trial of moral duty, and one that excuses repugnant behavior and psychological warfare in lieu of a repetitive, condescending sermon on honoring thy father."
8276,the-last-song-movie,Peter Travers,0,The only tragedy you'll face is paying good money to this swill.
8277,terminator-genisys-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"One achievement of James Cameron’s “Terminator” is that it overcame its low-rent, B-movie trappings. The great sin of “Genisys” is that it costs millions and yet isn’t worth a dime."
8278,rugrats-in-paris-the-movie---rugrats-ii-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,Seems more like a merchandising ploy than a successful attempt to entertain kids and their parents.
8279,wild-movie,Dana Stevens,70,"For most of Wild, we’re alone with Cheryl’s stark aloneness with herself. That’s a fine place to be."
8280,terminator-genisys-movie,A.A. Dowd ,67,"This new Terminator, the first since the dreadfully dreary and Arnold-less ""Salvation,"" is engineered to feel at once eerily familiar and raise-the-stakes fresh."
8281,il-postino-the-postman-movie,Elvis Mitchell,90,"A rueful, warmly affecting film featuring a wonderful performance by Mr. Troisi, The Postman would be attention-getting even without the sadness that overshadows it. [14 June 1995, p. C15]"
8282,green-room-movie,Jeffrey Bloomer,90,"Green Room proves to be an exquisitely crafted love letter to John Carpenter, and the rare horror ensemble that gives as much care to the villains as to the victims."
8283,the-heat-movie,Richard Roeper,88,This is one of the most entertaining movies of the year.
8284,fired-up!-movie,Scott Tobias,0,"On the off chance that anyone out there would want to spend time with guys like this—and would appreciate a bonus plug for Staples' recycled paper products, too--this movie has been made just for them."
8285,sea-of-love-movie,Bill Cosford,63,"Pacino is the only real attraction. His character feels ancient, used-up, bone-tired -- vulnerable, maybe, but numb. We need to see this in his face, and Pacino can use his the way Triple-A uses maps. That face is still one of the great instruments of modern movies.  [15 Sep 1989, p.G5]"
8286,the-wrestler-movie,J.R. Jones,80,"He looks like a truck ran over him, but at 52 he's still ripped enough to get away with the role; in the end the movie is about Rourke's indomitability more than the character's."
8287,feardotcom-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,"The story leapfrogs abruptly from scene to scene, and it makes such a mockery of narrative logic and continuity that the cast tends to look either baffled (Dorff) or as if they're trying to remain unrecognized."
8288,ronin-movie,Bill Gallo,90,"As is common in a Frankenheimer picture, the plot lines get a bit tangled in Ronin, but the atmosphere is tense, the style impeccable."
8289,grown-ups-2-movie,Matt Patches,20,"In the first five minutes, a deer walks into the star’s bedroom and urinates on his face. It’s all downhill from there."
8290,the-lords-of-salem-movie,Rex Reed,25,"This one is so bad it’s hilarious. Sheri Moon Zombie is no Mia Farrow, Rob Zombie is no Roman Polanski, and The Lords of Salem seems to have been made by people on the rubber bus headed for a rubber room with bars on the windows."
8291,the-perfect-holiday-movie,Marc Savlov,30,"Far from perfect and about as much fun as a holiday in Cambodia, this is lightweight yuletide fluffery, offensive neither in tone nor spirit but entirely unnecessary."
8292,twilight-movie,James Berardinelli,63,"Twilight isn't an especially good movie, but neither is it an abomination. At times, the dialogue is laugh-aloud bad - almost to the point of being hilarious."
8293,play-it-to-the-bone-movie,David Ehrenstein,10,A road movie trapped in a cul-de-sac.
8294,master-and-commander-the-far-side-of-the-world-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Like the work of David Lean, it achieves the epic without losing sight of the human, and to see it is to be reminded of the way great action movies can rouse and exhilarate us, can affirm life instead of simply dramatizing its destruction."
8295,a-lot-like-love-movie,Kyle Smith,38,Say this for A Lot Like Love: It isn't one of those impossibly witty romantic comedies.
8296,for-your-consideration-movie,James Berardinelli,75,"For Your Consideration will not go down as one of Guest's crown jewels, but it's nevertheless engaging."
8297,when-in-rome-movie,Andrea Gronvall,30,"Josh Duhamel plays the smitten sports reporter who helps her mount her big art show, ""Pain""--a fitting title, given the agony induced by this godawful comedy."
8298,paper-towns-movie,Bilge Ebiri,70,"The result isn’t an all-the-feels, drown-us-in-tears kind of experience, but something rooted in wisdom and clarity. It’s the rare movie that can sacrifice the clean lines of fantasy and melodrama for the messiness of ordinary life — that neither burnishes nor condemns the up-down turmoil of the teenage soul, but rather lets it be. "
8299,heaven-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"Mr. Tykwer's hands the movie changes almost magically from drama to chase to romance. As it does so its moral weight lessens; by the end there is less than what first engaged the mind. What meets the eye, though, is unforgettable."
8300,horns-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"A lot of the rougher stuff, depicting Ig's late-inning vengeance, is sadistically misjudged. It's hard to jerk tears a beat or two after gleeful rounds of brutality, even if it happens to, or because of, dear wee Daniel Radcliffe."
8301,the-divergent-series-allegiantpart-1-movie,Michael Snydel,33,"Above all of the tiresome, poorly constructed mythology, nonexistent stakes, and presentation of subtext as text, Allegiant’s greatest sin is its total contempt for its viewers."
8302,in-bruges-movie,Steven Rea,75,"In Bruges, at its best, works like ""Pulp Fiction"" with Irish (and Belgian) accents, digressing into weird discourse and giving a bunch of actors the occasion to shine in small, peculiar roles."
8303,analyze-this-movie,Lisa Alspector,10,"This blunt comedy suffers from poor pacing, colorless dialogue, and subpar performances by the two leads that reveal just how much a director contributes to our perception of what a star is."
8304,goodbye-christopher-robin-movie,Helen O'Hara,80,"The whole thing reads as an indictment of the sort of upper class upbringing that Milne's children's books idealised, with only paid employees offering worthwhile parental affection."
8305,i-spy-movie,Charles Taylor,30,"The movie is so thoroughly lousy. It's loud, brash and obvious, full of car chases and explosions and gunplay."
8306,monster-hunt-movie,Stephanie Merry,37,"Monster Hunt has visual appeal to spare, but the allure ends there."
8307,me-myself-irene-movie,Lou Lumenick,75,"Doesn't quite reach the heights - though it does plumb the depths - of its hugely popular predecessor. But it will have an enormous, appreciative audience doubled over with belly-busting laughs."
8308,scary-movie-2-movie,Paula Nechak,16,"There's a vicious, crude nerve that snakes through this sequel and it leaves no group unscarred -- but unfortunately, women and the handicapped take most of the thrusts."
8309,the-fantastic-four-movie,Peter Travers,0,The latest reboot of the Fantastic Four — the cinematic equivalent of malware — is worse than worthless.
8310,breaking-the-waves-movie,F. X. Feeney,100,"Not only one of the best films of the year, it's one of the best films of the decade."
8311,a-good-day-to-die-hard-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"For anyone who remembers the ""Die Hard"" adventures at their vital and exciting best, this film feels like a near-death experience. "
8312,summer-1993-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"Ms. Simón, who has used both of her young performers to powerful effect, also wants us to know how resilient children can be. Some creatures are able to grow new limbs. Frida, given more than half a chance after demanding it, achieves something no less remarkable. She grows new joy and hope."
8313,actress-movie,Christy Lemire,75,"Greene’s film is deceptively profound in that it’s about a specific woman with a specific kind of life, yet it has universal resonance as a reflection of the struggle so many women endure—the desire to be all things to all people and inevitably failing someone, the yearning to balance career and parenthood and never finding enough time to do either completely right."
8314,michael-movie,Keith Phipps,20,"John Travolta should realize that people appreciate him, maybe more than ever, but that he should start making movies people won't feel ashamed for having seen if he wants to avoid co-starring with a talking lemur in the future."
8315,night-at-the-museum-battle-of-the-smithsonian-movie,Rene Rodriguez,25,"Even Ben Stiller looks bored out of his mind in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, and he got paid several million dollars to star in it."
8316,taxi-movie,Marc Savlov,0,Very nearly as entertaining as watching a potato bake.
8317,the-iceman-movie,Tomas Hachard,38,"Michael Shannon has no interior to play with, since the film seems intent on ridding Richie of any emotion other than love for his family, and also no catharsis to build toward."
8318,twister-movie,Mike Clark,88,A summer crowd-pleaser worthy of its wind.
8319,my-one-and-only-movie,Leslie Felperin,70,The ensemble collectively displays crisp comic timing throughout.
8320,good-boy!-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,70,"Mostly, Good Boy! exists for the middle section where youngsters and dogs speak the same language. These escapades, all taking place under the adults' radar, generate many sound laughs."
8321,terminator-3-rise-of-the-machines-movie,Roger Ebert,63,Is Terminator 3 a skillful piece of work? Indeed. Will it entertain the Friday night action crowd? You bet. Does it tease and intrigue us like the earlier films did? Not really. 
8322,the-beverly-hillbillies-movie,Hal Hinson,30,"[A] scatterbrained imitation. [15 Oct 1993, p.D7]"
8323,200-cigarettes-movie,Keith Phipps,0,"More of a throwback to a period in the '70s when big-screen comedies like ""FM"" and ""Thank God It's Friday"" seemed to take all their cues from bad sitcoms, putting rice-paper-flat characters into vibrant settings and giving them nothing to do but exchange faux witty dialogue without the much-needed cues of a laugh track."
8324,vhs-movie,Roger Ebert,25,V/H/S is an example of the genre at its least compelling.
8325,the-dukes-of-hazzard-movie,Stephen Hunter,20,"So loud, so long, so dumb."
8326,going-in-style-movie,Robert Abele,35,The clichéd story wouldn’t even be an issue if the movie were enjoyable. But little works as humor or suspense or sentiment once the job is on.
8327,disturbia-movie,A.O. Scott,70,"There are no big surprises, but the jumps and jolts are well timed and the overall mood is at once grisly and good-natured -- more diverting than disturbing."
8328,jesus-camp-movie,Sara Brady,75,Doesn't function particularly well as a documentary; it lacks a strong editorial point of view and doesn't really comment on the evangelical movement so much as it just portrays a selection of people and their views.
8329,penguins-of-madagascar-movie,Simon Abrams,30,"Plays like a sampler of Dreamworks Animation's worst creative impulses: sugar-rush pacing, pandering meta-gags, and a slick, flavorless animation style."
8330,all-the-money-in-the-world-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,70,"This is a beguiling, somewhat grisly drama, based on something that happened to one genuinely unhappy, messed-up family."
8331,the-smurfs-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"Ineptly directed by Raja Gosnell -- the genius behind the ""Scooby-Doo"" features, ""Big Momma's House,"" and ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" -- this cheesy-looking flick has lousy animation, worse special effects and the most headache-inducing, blurry 3-D since ""Clash of the Titans."""
8332,star-trek-movie,Steve Persall,91,"The new, vastly improved Star Trek moves at warp speed through a marvelously reinvented sci-fi franchise, reverent to the past and firmly entrenched in the now."
8333,moonrise-kingdom-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,Beguiling and endearing. 
8334,goodfellas-movie,Jeremy Beday,80,"Martin Scorsese scores again with his gritty, kinetic adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's best-selling ""Wiseguy."""
8335,small-beautifully-moving-parts-movie,Andrew Schenker,38,"Gentler and less aesthetically assaultive than offerings like 0s & 1s and Catfish, but it's not necessarily any subtler or more enlightening. "
8336,air-force-one-movie,Sarah Kerr,10,"There's not a single thing about Air Force One to recommend, except perhaps the controlled performance of Glenn Close, who does remarkably well as the recipient of several phone calls from the sky."
8337,raging-bull-movie,Staff (Not Credited),70,"But the boxing sequences are possibly the best ever filmed, and the film captures the intensity of a boxer's life with considerable force."
8338,catwoman-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,For Friday night this will do just fine. It's definitely a good matchup -- Stone's cynical bravado versus Berry's resilient spunkiness in a world-class cat fight.
8339,merci-pour-le-chocolat-movie,Kevin Thomas,90,"Once again Chabrol's son Mathieu has composed a crucially evocative score, and Renato Berta's cinematography is gleaming. Merci Pour le Chocolat crackles with wit and elegance, humor and pathos."
8340,timeline-movie,Maitland McDonagh,20,This dreary science-fiction/historical-action hybrid is a misfire of staggering proportions. 
8341,the-edge-of-heaven-movie,Steven Rea,88,"The movie is near-perfect, suspenseful, heart-breaking, profound."
8342,your-highness-movie,Nick Pinkerton,30,Your Highness plays like a dirty-joke blooper reel made by the cast of a junky sword-and-sorcery epic.
8343,jaws-the-revenge-movie,Bill Cosford,12,"Among the mysteries of Hollywood life is the terribleness of Jaws sequels; they are the very worst of a bad lot. Now comes No. 4 -- Jaws the Revenge -- and it is as wretched as it is ungrammatical. [17 July 1987, p.1D]"
8344,dark-days-movie,Jack Mathews,88,Remarkable first film.
8345,the-bridges-of-madison-county-movie,Staff (not credited),75,"Robert Waller's inexplicably colossal bestseller is transferred to the screen with more art than it deserves, but neither old-fashioned Hollywood craftsmanship nor the massive star power of Eastwood and Streep can compensate for the story's intellectual slightness and emotional implausibility."
8346,the-dangerous-lives-of-altar-boys-movie,Stephen Holden,90,"The masterstroke of this small, heartfelt directorial debut (by Peter Care, from a screenplay by Jeff Stockwell) is its integration of animated sequences (by Todd McFarlane) in which action-adventure caricatures of the comic book characters parallel or comment on events in the boys' lives."
8347,wild-tales-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"The infectious dark comedy Wild Tales (Relatos salvajes) argues that payback is more satisfying when it’s doled out in fiery, bloody and outrageous doses. "
8348,legally-blonde-2-red-white-blonde-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,One of the strongest arguments yet for making sequels illegal.
8349,shut-in-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,20,"In this achingly inept thriller, you will see Naomi Watts do what she can to sell a plot of such preposterousness that the derisory laughter around me began barely 20 minutes in."
8350,townies-movie,Drew Taylor,91,"Neighbors is one of the funniest, most visually inventive studio comedies in recent memory."
8351,formula-51-movie,Stephen Hunter,0,Not a second of it is believable; not a tenth of a second of it is refreshing; not a millionth of a second is worthwhile
8352,56-up-movie,Kyle Smith,100,"56 Up is as good a point as any to get hooked on the magnificent half-century series of documentaries, beginning in 1964 with ""7 Up."""
8353,superman-iii-movie,Gary Arnold,20,"Every composite shot in Superman III appears to be a careless affront to the willing suspension of disbelief. The flying sequences are a letdown, the cataclysms are a cheat, and even the settings are often exposed as a chintzy hoot. [17 June 1983, p.C1]"
8354,shutter-island-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"What Scorsese brings to the table, having created more than his share of rascally villains, is a renewed sense of horror and despair at the power of evil."
8355,the-omen-movie,Stephen Holden,30,Terminally glum and waterlogged.
8356,56-up-movie,Joe Neumaier,100,"It shows that life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. And how, in case we forget, every age can predict the next."
8357,impostor-movie,Mike Clark,25,The only good thing about Impostor is the appropriateness of its title for a film posing as the first 2002 release.
8358,cafe-society-movie,Joe Dziemianowicz,70,"The rom-dram is wistful and wisecracking, boasts a polished ensemble and is such a period looker you wish you could time-travel to the Jazz Era."

8360,one-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,75,"Once in a while, a little reality can be a welcome antidote to our increasingly outsized film fantasies."
8361,trekkies-movie,Chris Gore,70,"Trekkies doesn't quite take us to the final frontier, however, it is the best documentary on the subject and a good laugh."
8362,catwoman-movie,Scott Foundas,30,"What the movie needs is a director, and what it gets instead is Pitof, a French visual-effects maestro so much fonder of technological wizardry than of human flesh that he manages to turn even his slinky, sinuous star attraction into a digitized synthespian frolicking about endless CGI cityscapes. "
8363,13-going-on-30-movie,Owen Gleiberman,91,The rare commercial comedy that leaves you entranced by what can happen only in the movies.
8364,domestic-disturbance-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,"The script is woefully inept, with plot twists that wouldn't pass muster in a high-school drama class."

8366,the-master-movie,Todd McCarthy,100,"Two things stand out: the extraordinary command of cinematic technique, which alone is nearly enough to keep a connoisseur on the edge of his seat the entire time, and the tremendous portrayals by Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman of two entirely antithetical men"
8367,the-passenger-re-release-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,Still packs a wallop. It's also a movie with no easy passage to its dark heart.
8368,charlotte-gray-movie,Stephen Holden,30,The movie works so diligently to convey a spirit of heroic uplift and fails so completely that it feels like a tragic misfire.
8369,the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn---part-2-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,63,"Characters are better employed; emotions are, for once, palpable; and the selfishness of Bella, author Stephenie Meyer's avatar, is finally somewhat squelched."
8370,sherlock-holmes-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,38,"This ""Holmes"" is just about as silly as it awesome. At times, Ritchie and company try so hard to make sure this isn't your father's ""Sherlock Holmes"" that it comes across as, well, cartoonish."
8371,fantastic-mr-fox-movie,Kimberley Jones,89,This is an animated film that happily has room for both an existentialist dread of death and a grinning joie de vivre.
8372,the-naked-gun-212-the-smell-of-fear-movie,Jay Carr,100,"My only complaint about Naked Gun 2 1/2 is that it doesn't give you enough time to finish laughing at one gag before the next one comes along, cracking you up all over again. Naked Gun 2 1/2 is high-flying low comedy, 90 minutes of sublime nonsense that only the devoutly humorless could hate. [28 June 1991, p.69]"
8373,dark-streets-movie,Josh Rosenblatt,30,Let no one ever say that Dark Streets doesn't have the perfect title. It may not be much more than a stylized regurgitation of creaky film-noir clichés and crime-fiction conventions … but its streets are undeniably dark.
8374,identity-thief-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Watch the trailer, if you must, but spare yourself the full experience: Identity Thief steals time."
8375,murder-by-numbers-movie,Desson Thomson,80,Turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting.
8376,go-get-some-rosemary-movie,J.R. Jones,80,"Ronald Bronstein, who wrote and directed the disquieting indie Frownland, steps in front of the cameras for this similarly lo-fi drama, and his loose-limbed performance as the brash, irresponsible father of two young boys establishes him as a genuine triple threat."
8377,a-wrinkle-in-time-movie,Jesse Hassenger,67,"Only Reid and Pine feel like they’re playing fully imagined characters, and DuVernay wrestles with how to make the overstuffed material both contemporary and timeless."
8378,the-bands-visit-movie,Jessica Reaves,75,"You can watch The Band’s Visit for its political idealism, or you can watch it for entertainment value alone. In either case, it doesn’t disappoint."
8379,little-men-movie,Johanna Schneller,88,"By the end, Sachs has raised urgent questions about immigration, classism, gentrification, loyalty, family and nascent sexuality – but he’s done so utterly organically, via 10 square feet of city. Lovely."
8380,view-from-the-top-movie,Shawn Levy,16,"If the new I-wanna-be-a-stewardess picture View From the Top were an airplane, it would blow up on takeoff. If it were an airline meal, it would infect you with E. coli. If it were a parachute, it would be riddled with holes. "
8381,the-straight-story-movie,Emmanuel Levy,80,Lynch has directed his most satisfyingly disciplined movie.
8382,how-to-survive-a-plague-movie,Katie Walsh,100,"One of the best documentaries, and best films, of the year, it is required viewing for anyone with a desire for making their own world a better place, inspiring you to act up and fight back."
8383,the-next-best-thing-movie,Dennis Harvey,30,"Likely lack of much critical enthusiasm or positive word-of-mouth will induce quick theatrical falloff, with better news likely down the line for rental merchants."
8384,mad-love-movie,Loren King,63,"Star Pilar Lopez de Ayala is such a feisty, striking presence, and the film so conventional in its depiction of a jealous and insatiable love, that it is hard to see Juana as anything other than a typical soap opera heroine."
8385,de-lovely-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"A musical and a biography, and brings to both of those genres a worldly sophistication that is rare in the movies."
8386,along-came-polly-movie,Stephen Holden,30,The spectacle of two mature stars forced to grovel in the bathroom for cheap laughs is pathetic.
8387,stranded-movie,Robert Abele,30,"Stranded stops at being merely seriously dull and trite, rather than tipping into train-wreck silliness. "
8388,boogie-nights-movie,John Hartl,90,"He (Anderson) simply doesn't allow for dull moments, and his gifts for irony and showmanship are clearly appreciated by a collection of actors who have rarely been better."
8389,man-on-fire-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"Man on Fire is ponderous and bloated, dragging the Bible and Giannini into its swirling cesspool. Scott can't give the movie any real emotional weight. And Washington gives his first lifeless performance. "
8390,dogma-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,30,"If you're an 11-year-old boy at heart, this is undoubtedly even better than the pile of dinosaur shit in Jurassic Park."
8391,the-meg-movie,Jeannette Catsoulis,30,"Unlike “Sharknado,” The Meg doesn’t seem to know how dumb it is. "
8392,liv-ingmar-movie,Diego Semerene,75,"The documentary not only humanizes Ingmar Bergman as the absent lover-cum-father of everyday life, but works as a priceless oral history of cinema."
8393,only-lovers-left-alive-movie,Jordan Hoffman,92,"Only Lovers Left Alive is an exhibit A example of how to use style to enhance substance, not overwhelm it. "
8394,happy-tears-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"The acting's not the problem, and it's a nice thing to find Moore playing a human-scaled human being, with a recognizable human touch. The material has a hint of it too. But only a hint."
8395,hell-or-high-water-movie,Tasha Robinson,88,"For all the methodical pacing and old archetypes, Hell or High Water is a thoroughly contemporary action film, complete with fast chases and flashes of dark comedy. But like the classic Westerns, it invites viewers to evaluate, one more time, the myth of the American outlaw, and the idea of criminals as heroes."
8396,secret-in-their-eyes-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,38,"Although a surprising number of plot machinations from the original film remain fully intact, usually accounting for anything that seems remotely clever, what is missing is the type of hold-your-breath tension provided by good thrillers."
8397,is-that-a-gun-in-your-pocket-movie,Noel Murray,0,"The movie tries to wrap an important social message in comedy, but it’s unpalatable all the way through."
8398,independence-day-resurgence-movie,Christy Lemire,38,"It’s just dull and hollow — a massive waste of time and money. The characters are flimsy, the dialogue is stilted and the amount of destruction is ridiculous."
8399,boys-dont-cry-movie,Wesley Morris,88,Boys Don't Cry's intensity sneaks up on you like a snake.
8400,raising-victor-vargas-movie,Ernest Hardy,90,"Victor Vargas has the look and feel of a neo-realist masterpiece, yet captures New York with a burnished authenticity not seen since the glory days of ’70s American cinema."
8401,the-reader-movie,J.R. Jones,70,"The revelation that Winslet’s character is a war criminal is the centerpiece of The Reader, but surrounding the Holocaust morality play is another story that’s more modestly scaled and, in this age of unashamed romance between older women and younger men, more contemporary."
8402,loves-labours-lost-movie,David Edelstein,10,Unfathomably awful.
8403,the-disappearance-of-alice-creed-movie,Eric Hynes,30,"Blakeson's feature-length calling card has storyboarded austerity and sadomasochistic promise but in the end lets the game play out in a familiar flurry of double-crossings, two-timings and false deaths, content to only fetishize itself."
8404,how-i-live-now-movie,A.A. Dowd ,67,"Ronan acquits herself nicely. Believable as both a smitten leading lady and a resourceful action heroine, she’s the ideal young-adult starlet — though after this and ""The Host,"" maybe it’s time the actress lent her piercing baby blues to a plain old adult project again."
8405,the-guardians-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"The Guardians is an intimate French epic, elegantly made and quietly emotional, a family story filled with characters whose lives we sink into, feeling the hope, the sadness, the sorrow and the joy right along with those on the screen."
8406,the-book-of-henry-movie,Andrew Crump,22,"The Book of Henry means well, but it doesn’t do well. It does incoherent pastiche and self-congratulatory pap instead."
8407,mister-foe-movie,Derek Elley,70,"Tip-top performances, led by young British thesp Jamie Bell, and a deftly handled tone reflecting all the title teen's confused emotions make Hallam Foe a viewing delight."
8408,undefeated-movie,Kyle Smith,25,This indie documentary is egregiously Hollywood in spirit. That a take-charge white football coach can buck up a place like Manassas HS with some gridiron grit is a lie we want to believe.
8409,wet-hot-american-summer-movie,Michael Atkinson,30,The film exists in a humid meta-movie ether all its own.
8410,super-troopers-movie,Dana Stevens,10,"Bad and tasteless. You laugh neither with it nor at it but rather sit counting the minutes while the movie laughs, for no good reason, at itself."
8411,a-cinderella-story-movie,Jami Bernard,38,"The only intriguing character is the manager of the diner (and de facto fairy godmother), played by Regina King. "
8412,everybody-has-a-plan-movie,Kyle Smith,38,Argentina’s noir Everybody Has a Plan is as sludgy as the river delta in which it takes place.
8413,ready-to-rumble-movie,John Anderson,10,"A movie made for wrestling fans that makes fun of wrestling fans? That cuts a little too close to the vicarious masochism at the heart of pro wrestling's core constituency. Also, it's not funny."
8414,party-monster-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,"Devotes most of its energy to its costumes and makeup, which are fabulous. But that and a tabloid-worthy star just aren't enough to revisit this sordid tale as a kind of twisted comedy. "
8415,kingsman-the-golden-circle-movie,Michael Phillips,38,"Kingsman: The Golden Circle offers everything — several bored Oscar winners, two scenes featuring death by meat grinder, Elton John mugging in close-up — except a good time."
8416,sleeping-beauty-movie,Rex Reed,25,"Movies like Sleeping Beauty are as sensual as cottage cheese, not to mention passé."
8417,orange-county-movie,Robert K. Elder,38,"Black delivers the best line (“Do you want me to get naked and start the revolution?”), and Lithgow scores a giggle for calling his ex-wife “coyote ugly” to her face, but neither of them can disguise this lemon."
8418,a-good-old-fashioned-orgy-movie,Steven Rea,38,Completely unappealing people. 
8419,testament-of-youth-movie,Joe Morgenstern,90,"Thanks to this new film, though, any questions about her potential have been dispelled. Alicia Vikander has fully and memorably arrived, a luminous presence with a gift for tenderness, an instinct for understatement and formidable reserves of passion—she not only rises to the challenge of Vera’s climactic speech, but elevates the pacifist rhetoric into furious poetry."
8420,swept-away-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,10,"Isn't dubbed. But it sure feels like it. The characters open their mouths and their lips don't seem to be shaping the right words -- you can't believe any human beings would ever utter such ludicrous dialogue, with so little conviction."
8421,shadow-of-the-vampire-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,30,"An academic exercise driven by adolescent ideas that never shape themselves into a narrative: in short, a movie that can never dislodge the art fatally wedged up its butt."
8422,voyeur-movie,Jordan Hoffman,80,"There are issues of trust between the two men. It’s unclear who is exploiting whom—and impossible to know what is being recreated for the camera and what is being captured “live.” This is all to the betterment of Voyeur, which, it isn’t too much of a spoiler to say, ultimately concludes that Mr. Talese and Mr. Foos aren’t all that different from one another."
8423,freddy-got-fingered-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,So awful it qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment.
8424,the-tortured-1969-movie,Scott Tobias,16,"There's an opportunity here for screenwriter Marek Posival and director Robert Lieberman to play up the squeamishness of upper-middle-class torturers who don't fit the profile, but they're too busy tending to horror-thriller clichés."
8425,kingdom-of-heaven-movie,Todd McCarthy,80,"Genuinely spectacular and historically quite respectable, Ridley Scott's latest epic is at its strongest in conveying the savagery spawned by fanaticism."
8426,corky-romano-movie,Lisa Alspector,10,"Corky never becomes sympathetic, and without this fundamental irony the movie doesn't have a leg to stand on."
8427,all-the-queens-men-movie,Scott Tobias,0,Stultifying.
8428,the-house-movie,Richard Roeper,25,"Despite the pairing of the eminently likable and talented Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler as the leads, and about a dozen recognizable (and usually funny) supporting players, The House is a fetid, cheap-looking, depressing and occasionally even mean-spirited disaster."
8429,bait-movie,Stephen Holden,10,"Why Mr. Foxx, who was so impressive in ""Any Given Sunday,"" chose to make a movie so boring and idiotic that it barely meets minimal standards of lowest- common-denominator entertainment."
8430,snatched-movie,Tom Russo,75,The movie also plays as an extended reminder of why we love Goldie. It’s enormous fun seeing Hawn up to her old tricks — at 71! — even if they’re tweaked to help sell someone else’s brand of comedy. 
8431,left-behind-2014-movie,Richard Roeper,38,"Everything about this film feels forced, clunky and overwrought."
8432,draft-day-movie,Peter Keough,38,"It’s a big deal for the NFL and ESPN, no doubt, and Draft Day serves as 110 minutes of product placement for both."
8433,cecil-b-demented-movie,David Sterritt,75,"The comedy is frantic and tasteless in the usual Waters mode, but it takes telling potshots at the Hollywood establishment, which isn't nearly so open about the tackiness of its products."
8434,the-walking-deceased-movie,Ed Gonzalez,12,"This juvenile horror-comedy spoof is primarily, if unintentionally, a cautionary tale about the perils of allowing brahs to make movies. "
8435,prime-movie,Peter Rainer,67,"Frankly, the most disturbing thing about Prime is that Uma Thurman is now officially an Older Woman."
8436,the-jungle-book-2016-movie,Moira Macdonald,75,"For the most part, the movie finds a family-friendly balance between stunning scenery, hold-your-breath action and animals having goofy conversations with each other."
8437,the-chateau-movie,Robert K. Elder,25,"Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very, very slowly."
8438,white-material-movie,Steven Rea,100,"While White Material is very much the story of this one woman, it is also a story of postcolonial Africa, a place where Europeans staked their claim, and where disorder and destruction upended everything. A mournful, frightening, powerful film."
8439,y-tu-mama-tambien-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"Part travelogue, part road picture, part meditation on class, mortality and intimacy, this extraordinary little movie might be the perfect harbinger of summer, as astute as it is steamy."
8440,tadpole-movie,Ann Hornaday,100,"It's a funny, fearless, poignant, spectacular performance. Come to think of it, those words could well apply to the entirety of Tadpole."
8441,mississippi-grind-movie,Peter Travers,88,"The movie needed great performances, and it gets them from Ryan Reynolds and Ben Mendelsohn."
8442,the-divergent-series-allegiantpart-1-movie,Steve Persall,25,"The pleasures of Allegiant are unintended, those little bits of business taken so seriously that serious viewers must laugh."
8443,dreamcatcher-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"So much is going on, and so many bizarre and seemingly random subplots collide in Dreamcatcher, that the film feels like some crazy patchwork quilt sewn by a schizophrenic seamstress. It’s not only confusing, but dull, as well. "
8444,little-black-book-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"Little Black Book isn't your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy – it's much worse – and, rather disgustingly, the devils on earth it unmasks are all female and vindictive."
8445,black-swan-movie,Keith Phipps,91,"A florid, often lurid, completely enthralling film held in place by a disarming Portman, who rarely leaves the frame. "
8446,into-the-abyss-movie,Alison Willmore,90,"Into the Abyss, which bears the subtitle ""A Tale of Death, A Tale of Life,"" reveals itself to be an outlandish, compassionate and, at times, improbably buoyant film about life's capacity for grief and horror and about how it bubbles on miraculously in the face of such things. It's the best thing Herzog's done in years. "
8447,senseless-movie,Liam Lacey,0,Just how dumb is Senseless? So dumb it even takes the fun out of stupid.
8448,rollerball-movie,Connie Ogle,0,"Plentiful helpings of dreadful acting, confusing action cinematography, choppy editing and embarrassing dialogue, with the added bonus of a plot almost as dumb as that of the original film."
8449,i-dreamed-of-africa-movie,Lisa Alspector,30,Ultimately the movie is alluring and respectful--its sadness may be what saves it from becoming sensationalist or trite.
8450,sideways-movie,Ty Burr,100,It's a performance (Giamatti's) so nuanced and so real in its everyday pain that it doesn't stand a chance of winning an Oscar. But it should.
8451,ranas-wedding-movie,Phil Hall,100,"Among the finest films made in the Middle East. This small, subtle gem offers a vivid portrait of life in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, presenting its message with an intelligence and vibrancy that celebrates the human spirit in an environment where humanity is routinely crushed and assaulted."
8452,showgirls-movie,Kenneth Turan,0,"Lacking the combustible Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas in leading roles, Showgirls descends into incoherent tedium. Though the filmmakers' incessant talk about vision, artistry and honest self-expression lead one to expect a sexually explicit biopic about the Dalai Lama, what is in fact provided is depressing and disappointing as well as dehumanizing."
8453,apocalypse-now-redux-movie,Kim Morgan,100,"No matter how many times you've seen it, you marvel at how terrifying, gorgeous and surreal the jungle, the yellow napalm and, finally, the disturbed face of Martin Sheen lying under a swirling fan appear on the large screen. This is indeed, a dream."
8454,pixels-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"Every joke is lame, every special effect unspecial."
8455,wall-street-money-never-sleeps-movie,Roger Moore,63,"It's almost kitschy - the way Stone injects himself into a couple of scenes,  an eccentric Eli Wallach cameo, the inclusion of a Charlie Sheen moment that flat out winks at the audience."
8456,spy-movie,Olly Richards,80,"The supporting cast is a kick. Law gets to send up the Bond role, something he could very well have played in his younger days; Allison Janney fills her boots as the angry head of the agency and Statham, frankly, should only ever play this role for the rest of his life."
8457,life-as-we-know-it-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,"There's something about Holly: She's the most ridiculous, irritating, two-dimensional rom-com heroine since...Katherine Heigl's last rom-com. "
8458,the-perfect-man-movie,Stephen Hunter,20,"Baby, when you walk out of a movie thinking, ""Say, that Heather Locklear was pretty darn good,"" the movie's got some problems!"
8459,a-river-changes-course-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,80,"For the most part, the narrative here feels generational, representative, rather than invested in the specific incidents of specific lives."
8460,pacific-rim-uprising-movie,Nick Schager,30,"Pacific Rim Uprising delivers plentiful CG mayhem.... What it lacks, though, is both del Toro’s trademark Lovecraftian imagery (all slick tentacles and dank subterranean locales) and the sense of thunderous heft that the Mexican auteur bestowed upon his titans."
8461,beauty-and-the-beast-2017-movie,Kate Taylor,75,"Disney’s live-action revival of the Beauty and the Beast franchise is nothing if not lively, albeit occasionally overwrought: The dinnerware’s number, Be Our Guest, turns into a hallucinogenic sequence worthy of Busby Berkeley. "
8462,4-little-girls-movie,David Armstrong,75,The movie is strongest when Lee keeps his eye on the prize: the experiences of ordinary people in an extraordinary time.
8463,femme-fatale-movie,Megan Lehmann,38,"De Palma fools around with split screens and slo-mo, but no amount of cinematic artifice can varnish over the fact that this is simply a bad film."
8464,it-follows-movie,Craig Williams,100,"Its thematic textures run deep, but the picture retains real visceral force."
8465,trainwreck-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,70,"In the way of most Apatow films, Trainwreck is a little too long, a little too shaggy and a little too conservative in insisting that all’s square in love and war."
8466,suicide-squad-movie,Jake Cole,25,"Like the recruited criminals themselves, the film longs to be bad, yet its forced by outside pressures to follow narrow, preset rules."
8467,vera-drake-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"The strength of Leigh's film is that it is not a message picture, but a deep and true portrait of these lives."
8468,nobel-son-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,"Randall Miller (Bottle Shock), appears to be trying to cross a bad Elmore Leonard thriller with a bad indie-festival family-angst  comedy. He gives us the worst of both worlds."
8469,fifty-shades-freed-movie,Christopher Orr,20,"The good news—and, yes, we are grading on a curve so steep that it’s essentially a vertical drop—is that Fifty Shades Freed is marginally less retrograde and offensive than Fifty Shades Darker. The bad news is that it is even more idiotic, which is in its way a remarkable achievement."
8470,the-face-of-an-angel-movie,Clayton Dillard,75,"Michael Winterbottom's film is a mess of tones, but not of ideas, which could well sum up the director's prodigious but uneven oeuvre. "
8471,vegas-vacation-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Why, if Chase is such a funny guy, does he make such unfunny movies? "
8472,thief-movie,Scott Tobias,90,"Debut features are rarely this confident and accomplished, much less such a perfect blueprint of what to expect from a filmmaker down the line."
8473,snow-dogs-movie,Michael Dequina,10,Incredibly dull.
8474,philomena-movie,Bill Zwecker,88,"Director Steven Frears deserves special mention. A lesser filmmaker could so easily have turned this project into mushy, sentimental junk. The tear-jerking moments here are heartfelt and real. It’s the kind of filmmaking we see too little of today."
8475,freddy-got-fingered-movie,Gene Seymour,10,Even the movie finds itself asking when it'll end. Not soon enough.
8476,waynes-world-2-movie,Jeff Shannon,63,"If you can find a handful of funny, original gags and TV-inspired in-jokes in this second compendium of now overly familiar Wayne-speak witticisms, consider your 100 minutes time well spent. [10 Dec 1993, p.G3]"
8477,fools-rush-in-movie,David Sterritt,25,"Tennant's featherweight comedy is clearly pitched at the date-movie crowd, and couples may enjoy it if they can get past the picture's simplistic ethnic stereotypes and its willingness to wish away every real-life family problem the characters will surely face after the feel-good finale. "
8478,the-thin-red-line-movie,John Hartl,90,"Could be called the ""Red Badge of Courage"" of World War II movies."
8479,some-velvet-morning-movie,Sara Stewart,25,"Minus its smirky twist ending, it’d make perfect material for New York’s new “That’s Abuse” domestic violence awareness campaign."
8480,nebraska-movie,Dave Calhoun,80,More than ever Payne allows the humour to rise up gently from his story rather than burst through it.
8481,lost-in-paris-movie,Chuck Bowen,63,"Lost in Paris abounds in whimsy that, for the most part, isn't irritatingly precious—a feat that's harder to pull off than it appears. "
8482,hellboy-ii-the-golden-army-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,100,"With writer-director del Toro given free license to go where his singular vision takes him, Hellboy II plays like Guillermo's Greatest Hits with even hotter visual effects."
8483,rebels-of-the-neon-god-movie,A.O. Scott,80,"Mr. Tsai typically uses narrative as a tool for exploring the moods and meanings that link his characters with one another and with the city that awakens, contains and frustrates their desires. They seem very much stuck in their world, but because that world is the creation of a wildly original artist coming into his own, it also feels alive with possibility."
8484,joe-dirt-movie,Rita Kempley,10,We should be asking ourselves why so noble a nation would produce swill like Joe Dirt.
8485,the-spy-who-dumped-me-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,30,What’s lost in comedy is not matched by a gain in emotional engagement.
8486,bewitched-movie,Joe Morgenstern,20,"Why is the movie such a mess? Will Ferrell plays a washed-up actor who's supposed to be a hopeless mess, but even his character makes little sense. Is it all supposed to be postmodern? No, it's post-postmortem, the dead spirit of a dearly departed show."
8487,garden-state-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"There's even a Simon and Garfunkel tune on the soundtrack, which makes Braff's character seem like the only living boy in New Jersey, which, of course, he may well be. L'chaim! "
8488,mean-machine-movie,Shawn Levy,33,"A by-the-numbers recipe that ought to have shot off at least a few sparks, is as drab as the inmates' prison blues."
8489,high-rise-2015-movie,Sam Fragoso,85,"There’s a sadistic streak in High-Rise that’s simultaneously hypnotizing and unnerving. If there’s a morality to Wheatley’s world, it’s nebulous at best."
8490,mr-hollands-opus-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,20,Mr. Holland's Opus is the kind of movie that only a person who really doesn't like movies could love. It's a movie whose grandiose swagger is meant as compensation for its message about the resignation of the human spirit to smaller gratifications and vistas.
8491,water-for-elephants-movie,Kimberley Jones,30,"No one would mistake the Benzini Bros. Circus for the greatest show on earth – the Depression-era traveling troupe is a junker compared to the gold-standard Ringling Bros. – but still, a film has to try pretty hard to render lions and tigers and trapeze artists so uniformly underwhelming."
8492,eyes-wide-shut-movie,Michael Wilmington,100,"A spellbinder: provocatively conceived, gorgeously shot and masterfully executed."
8493,good-boy!-movie,Stephen Cole,38,"In the right hands, Good Boy! might have been a ripe bit of mischief. But except for an endless drum roll of fart jokes, what we get is stuffy liberal humanism that would bore the Oshkoshes off Al Gore's littlest nieces and nephews."
8494,elena-movie,Scott Tobias,91,It's an austere Russian drama with shades of Hitchcock.
8495,demonlover-movie,V.A. Musetto,63,I've seen Demonlover twice and still find the plot a challenge. I'd try again if I thought it would help. 
8496,rory-oshea-was-here-movie,Michael Rechtshaffen,70,"The kind of inspirational movie that actually earns its crowd-rousing response as opposed to merely pushing the same old, emotion-coaxing buttons."
8497,bopha!-movie,Vincent Canby,70,"Bopha! is so firmly grounded in physical reality (it was shot in Zimbabwe), in the looks and passions of its characters, even in its music, that its deliberate progress from one obligatory scene to the next still carries surprising emotional weight."
8498,russian-doll-movie,Michael Atkinson,20,"The cheesy idiot-twin of Pawel Pawlikowski's superb ""Last Resort."""
8499,american-gangster-movie,Rene Rodriguez,88,"What American Gangster does have -- what makes it such a commanding, exhilarating movie -- is a consummate love and understanding of story."
8500,eyes-wide-shut-movie,Peter Brunette,100,"As the late Stanley Kubrick's swansong, it fills the bill magnificently."
8501,cherish-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"A film of real beauty, which is surprising, since it's not a movie of beautiful sentiments or settings."
8502,lethal-weapon-4-movie,Marc Savlov,0,"Not only is the franchise growing hoary, by now it's become downright laughable, leaving Lethal Weapon 4 feeling more like a bad Fox sitcom than anything else. "
8503,in-between-movie,Deborah Young,90,"After watching Maysaloun Hamoud’s sparkling, taboo-breaking first feature In Between (Bar Bahar), audiences will have to seriously update their ideas about the lifestyle of Palestinian women in Israel."
8504,iousa-movie,Robert Koehler,10,"One graphic that I.O.U.S.A. doesn't include is a national balance sheet of our assets and liabilities, which would illustrate that the former is more than double the latter. We're in the black, and a film this deep in the red isn't something to be scared of at all -- or taken seriously."
8505,basic-movie,Todd McCarthy,70,"The teasing tale is told with such dispatch it will carry willing audiences along; genre staples of action, macho attitude and corruption through the ranks are delivered intact."
8506,beautiful-movie,Desson Thomson,10,Insufferably cloying experience.
8507,enders-game-movie,Peter Debruge,70,"An impressive, thought-provoking astro-adventure that benefits from the biggest screen available."
8508,bitter-harvest-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,37,"There ought to be no lack of firepower in telling this shameful tale. Too often, however, Bitter Harvest is guilty of overkill."
8509,sgt-bilko-movie,Jay Carr,63,"Martin makes Bilko's roguishness endearing, and entertaining enough to carry the film even if it is essentially an overextended half-hour sitcom episode. [29 Mar 1996, p.105]"
8510,north-by-northwest-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,"North by Northwest is the Alfred Hitchcock mixture - suspense, intrigue, comedy, humor. Seldom has the concoction been served up so delectably. "
8511,howl-movie,Scott Tobias,75,Epstein and Friedman's doc-like approach also results in a certain dramatic stasis; Howl is a film aimed more for the head than the gut.
8512,midnight-special-movie,Brian Tallerico,100,"Midnight Special respects your intelligence, letting you come to its themes emotionally instead of narratively. It is a breathtaking display of visual storytelling, confidently rendered by someone who understands the power of cinema."
8513,bopha!-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"It is a great performance by Danny Glover, the portrait of a proud man who discovers his pride was entrusted to the wrong things."
8514,standard-operating-procedure-movie,Roger Ebert,100,"Disturbing, analytical and morose. This is not a ""political"" film nor yet another screed about the Bush administration or the war in Iraq. It is driven simply, powerfully, by the desire to understand those photographs."
8515,see-spot-run-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,Do your kids a favor - and take them to see something more worthwhile than the relentlessly vulgar and stupid See Spot Run.
8516,sahara-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"A stunning piece of work--stunningly inept, stunningly incoherent, stunningly awful in every single way imaginable."
8517,pepe-le-moko-re-release-movie,Kenneth Turan,100,"Beautifully crafted, movingly acted, still involving and entertaining, this is just the kind of film people are talking about when they say they don't make them like this anymore."
8518,timeline-movie,Jack Mathews,25,"An instant contender for cult status on the midnight-movie circuit, where lines like ""Do we look like quantum wormhole specialists?"" will be given the respect they deserve."
8519,mighty-aphrodite-movie,Barbara Shulgasser,75,It was only natural that Allen would eventually have to make a Greek drama.
8520,two-family-house-movie,Chris Kaltenbach,100,"Well-acted, lovingly put together and heartbreakingly honest."
8521,kill-your-darlings-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,80,"Brash, bristling, highly watchable film."
8522,the-accountant-movie,Michael Roffman,33,The Accountant tallies up its numbers for an achingly long 50 minutes before it starts to finally piece together any semblance of a structured plot.
8523,the-greatest-movie-ever-sold-movie,David Edelstein,70,"It's surprising that The Greatest Movie Ever Sold plays so entertainingly, given that Spurlock's quest is essentially beside the point."
8524,brooklyn-castle-movie,Kevin Jagernauth,83,It subtly makes the connection between the simple equation that investment in our children will give dividends that go far beyond any sort of number on a balance sheet. 
8525,atlas-shrugged-part-i-movie,Peter Travers,0,"Who's the idiot responsible for this fiasco? You can't blame the Tea Party, an organization of 9 million that the film's producers are exploiting to get butts into seats. There's an object lesson in objectivism for you."
8526,kung-fu-panda-movie,Lawrence Toppman,88,"The voice cast includes Angelina Jolie as a tigress, omnipresent Seth Rogen as an acupuncturist who's a praying mantis, David Cross as a nasal crane and Lucy Liu as a cheerful viper."
8527,youth-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,From early on my strong desire was for this horribly pretentious phantasmagoria to be over.
8528,gloria-movie,Peter Travers,0,"When studios plant these stink bombs in theaters, do they really think that audiences won't notice the stench?"
8529,man-on-the-moon-movie,Jay Carr,63,"Remains a frustratingly opaque study. There's something missing, namely Kaufman."
8530,the-merchant-of-venice-movie,Phil Hall,10,The single worst Shakespeare film ever made.
8531,the-wings-of-the-dove-movie,Michael Sragow,90,"Seductive from the start, the film grows more stimulating and involving as it goes along because these three are original people who mate and recombine unpredictably."
8532,a-hijacking-movie,Oliver Lyttelton,100,"The film isn’t a white knuckle ride, and the pacing can be slow at times, but this is one of those cases where that’s sort of the point, and you certainly don’t begrudge it. A Hijacking is an absorbing, highly moving film."
8533,abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,"This insipid mashup of history lesson and monster flick takes itself semi-seriously, which is truly deadly."
8534,the-english-patient-movie,Michael Sragow,70,"This intelligent, affecting work is squishy at the core."
8535,the-accountant-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,30,Here's two hours of grimly serious puzzle-box dramatics and beat-downs starring Ben Affleck as an Affleck-shaped void.
8536,charlie-wilsons-war-movie,Ken Fox,75,"With 20/20 9/11 hindsight, it's clear that covertly arming the Mujahedeen wasn’t such a good idea after all, but neither Nichols nor Sorkin wants to spoil the fun."
8537,the-last-face-movie,Nikola Grozdanovic,0,"It’s, all told, a preposterous and pretentious mess of a film, and all the good intentions in the world don’t mean anything when the execution is as ham-fisted as it is here."
8538,boat-trip-movie,Marrit Ingman,0,"There are bad movies, and there’s Boat Trip, a puerile comedy so appalling and unfunny, it’s like contracting the Norwalk virus at sea. "
8539,the-manchurian-candidate-1962-movie,Kim Newman,100,A dazzling spy thriller that’s still amazing.
8540,dogma-movie,Roger Ebert,88,"If the film is less than perfect, it is because Smith is too much in love with his dialogue.  Smith is a gifted comic writer who loves paradox, rhetoric and unexpected zingers from the blind side."
8541,fly-away-movie,Kyle Smith,63,"Fly Away is more situation than story, though, and the Germann character's welcoming, almost saintly vibe doesn't fit."
8542,besotted-movie,Maitland McDonagh,30,"Hardman is a grating, mannered onscreen presence, which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast."
8543,gossip-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"A glossy, shallow thriller where not a single scene rings true."
8544,big-ass-spider!-movie,John DeFore,70,Mike Mendez's shamelessly Corman-esque Big Ass Spider! does almost everything just a tiny bit better than it needs to. 
8545,feardotcom-movie,Ernest Hardy,10,"The film, whose clumsy editing and dearth of establishing shots keep the viewer in an unintended state of confusion, is a corpse in its own right: It’s filled with the rotting ideas of far better movies."
8546,snow-white-and-the-huntsman-movie,Dana Stevens,30,"Snow White and the Huntsman, the first feature from British commercial director Rupert Sanders, has its work cut out for it if it wants to be a truly dull piece of junk - but it manages."
8547,the-lobster-movie,Michael Roffman,83,"The Greek filmmaker builds a stunning world with The Lobster, and much of its success stems from the inherent mechanics and the less-is-more storytelling that drops empty spaces for the mind to paint."
8548,sex-and-lucia-movie,Tim Merrill,100,"Medem's astonishing, magical-realist love story Sex and Lucía is easily the best Spanish film since ""All About My Mother."" But such a statement actually undersells the beauty of what Medem has created, which in many ways rather defies description."
8549,whipped-movie,Stephen Holden,0,Bottom-feeding monstrosity of a comedy.
8550,eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,"Watching Eternal Sunshine, you don't just watch a love story -- you fall in love with what love really is."
8551,behind-enemy-lines-movie,Lou Lumenick,63,"A slickly entertaining war movie that's sometimes striking, sometimes silly -- but never, ever boring."
8552,ararat-movie,David Grove,70,"Ararat isn't a great film because it's too convoluted and personal at times, but it's a showcase of technical mastery; the way Egoyan interweaves the stories of the historical recreation, the relationship between the son and his stepsister and the mystery of the art historian's dead husbands, is endlessly compelling."
8553,cradle-2-the-grave-movie,Robert K. Elder,0,"Replete with audience-insulting writing and blatantly hateful jokes, storytelling like this makes most video game plots look like ""Moby Dick."""
8554,foxcatcher-movie,Jessica Kiang,100,"With Foxcatcher, [Miller] has outdone himself, turning his uniquely meticulous eye to a tiny story in a totally rarefied, specific environment and through whatever alchemy he has perfected, created something so universal and resonant that it feels epic, sprawling, almost ancient in its mythic overtones. Foxcatcher is an enormous film."
8555,saving-silverman-movie,Marc Savlov,0,Reaches toward new heights of comic laziness and succeeds beyond anyone's wildest expectations.
8556,things-to-do-in-denver-when-youre-dead-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"Ought to be the subject of an obituary, not a review. A creepy film noir modeled on Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs,"" it was a stinking stiff on arrival."
8557,dallas-buyers-club-movie,Marc Mohan,91,"It wouldn’t be surprising to hear about moviegoers demanding their money back after seeing The Dallas Buyers Club, but not because the film isn’t good. It’s actually very nearly great."
8558,new-years-eve-movie,Linda Holmes,30,"At its heart, Garry Marshall's New Year's Eve is soup made of rocks. "
8559,the-triumph-of-love-movie,David Edelstein,80,Sets you nearer than theater permits -- and further back than most movies dare. A magic vantage.
8560,total-recall-movie,Rita Kempley,0,"The overall effect is like wading through hospital waste. Verhoeven, who also directed the maliciously stylistic ""Robocop,"" disappoints with this appalling onslaught of blood and boredom."
8561,thirteen-days-movie,Richard Schickel,70,"The players don't particularly look like their historical models, but they make us feel their life-threatening pain and puzzlement."
8562,dirty-grandpa-movie,Martyn Conterio,20,"Dirty Grandpa wants to be as filthy as a Tijuana peep show featuring a beleaguered performer and put upon donkey, but ends up as sickly sweet as a Werther's Original."
8563,30-minutes-or-less-movie,Todd Gilchrist,80,"At barely 80 minutes, the film seems like a slight little adventure, but Fleischer fleshes out his twists and turns to make it feel like a fully-rendered story."
8564,the-hunt-movie,James Adams,63,"While The Hunt strives mightily to provoke outrage, get the blood boiling, pluck the heartstrings and open the tear ducts, it never quite succeeds – a function of a narrative whose failures of credibility, finally, prevent a viewer from wholeheartedly embracing what director Thomas Vinterberg wants us to feel."
8565,monster-in-law-movie,Claudia Puig,38,Doesn't make the movie worth watching -- even if you're monstrously bored.
8566,the-wettest-county-in-the-world-movie,David Rooney,80,"If Lawless doesn't achieve the mythic dimensions of the truly great outlaw and gangster movies, it is a highly entertaining tale set in a vivid milieu, told with style and populated by a terrific ensemble. "
8567,nutty-professor-ii-the-klumps-movie,John Hartl,10,Utterly unnecessary sequel.
8568,passengers-2016-movie,Tirdad Derakhshani,63,"It's a small, intimate chamber piece with beautiful camerawork and gorgeous art direction ... until it loses its way in a wrongheaded bid for sci-fi greatness."
8569,out-of-sight-movie,Rick Groen,88,"Undoubtedly, [the lead actors] both benefit hugely from the sharpness of Leonard's stock-in-trade dialogue: Put smart words in any actor's yap, and their performance will rise accordingly."
8570,place-vendome-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,"When Deneuve is not onscreen, the film is never denuff."
8571,snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs-movie,Rene Rodriguez,100,"And the animation, ultimately, is what makes Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs worth seeing again on the big screen. Aladdin may have grossed more than $200 million, but even its state-of- the-art, computer-assisted animation can't surpass the detail and fluidity, the denser-than-reality feel, the astonishing palette (check out the red on the poisoned apple) of the film. Watching it, you don't forget it's a cartoon: You relish that it is. What bigger compliment is there than that? [2 July 1993, p.G5]"
8572,the-generals-daughter-movie,David Denby,30,A classic case of Hollywood hypocrisy and ineptitude.
8573,the-post-movie,Owen Gleiberman,80,"The Pentagon Papers marked an iconic moment in American history: the press claiming its own freedom to call out the excesses of power. The Post celebrates what that means, tapping into an enlightened nostalgia for the glory days of newspapers, but the film also takes you back to a time when the outcome was precarious, and the freedoms we thought we took for granted hung in the balance. Just as they do today."
8574,new-york-minute-movie,Sara Gebhardt,30,"Sadly, small humorous bits do not change the movie's generally lackluster tone. "
8575,the-reckoning-movie,Desson Thomson,30,"Although the acting is committed and sometimes stirring, most of the characters are about as one-note as the biblical archetypes Martin wants to get away from in the first place. ""The Name of the Rose"" this ain't. "
8576,feardotcom-movie,Collin Levey,0,"For the most part, the movie serves up an incomprehensible collage of high-tech voyeurism sprinkled with every hackneyed creep-out trick in the book -- from eerie little ghost girls to melting walls and scurrying cockroaches."
8577,star-wars-episode-iii---revenge-of-the-sith-movie,Kenneth Turan,70,"The most energetic of the prequels, the only one at all worth watching. But that doesn't mean it is without the weaknesses that scuttled its pair of predecessors. Quite the contrary."
8578,basic-instinct-2-movie,Peter Travers,0,"The laughs to be had in this deliciously awful sequel are all unintentional. A bummer for film buffs, but a ball for fans of the misbegotten."
8579,green-room-movie,Drew McWeeny,100,"Just on a technical level, the film represents such a big jump forward for Saulnier that you should expect the studios to immediately start arguing over which giant soulless franchise should occupy his time in the near-future."
8580,armageddon-movie,Peter Travers,0,How do I hate Armageddon? Let me count the ways.
8581,wild-things-movie,Jimmy Fowler,10,"Wild Things reaches such dizzying heights of wretched dialogue, creaky contrivances, and panting performances, you're forced to wonder if the filmmakers realized how bad their script was and switched gears into pure camp at some point during the shoot."
8582,the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-the-beginning-movie,Kyle Smith,38,Misses everything that made the first one eat into your spine like meningitis.
8583,life-or-something-like-it-movie,Michael Dequina,30,"Director Stephen Herek certainly doesn't come up with anything, and he fails to make the swings between silliness and schmaltz smoothly."
8584,mixed-nuts-movie,Peter Stack,38,"Mixed Nuts, opening today at Bay Area movie theaters, is laced generously with chuckles, though it neglects one little detail that helps make movies satisfying: a plot. [21 Dec 1994, p.E1]"
8585,the-emoji-movie-movie,Alonso Duralde,0,"It is a soul-crushing disaster because it lacks humor, wit, ideas, visual style, compelling performances, a point of view or any other distinguishing characteristic that would make it anything but a complete waste of your time, not to mention that of the diligent animators who brought this catastrophe into being."
8586,ballistic-ecks-vs-sever-movie,Lawrence Toppman,12,"Zomboid, convoluted excuse for a thriller is among year's worst."
8587,unaccompanied-minors-movie,Kyle Smith,12,89 minutes go by like 89 hours. Not just 89 regular hours either: 89 hours of being stuck in an airport. During a blizzard. While Lewis Black sleeps drooling on your shoulder.
8588,wonder-wheel-movie,Richard Roeper,38,"On its own “merits,” it would still be a dud. A sluggish, uninspired, period-piece retread of so many earlier and much better Allen films, filled with overly familiar characters and situations and of course a soundtrack seemingly selected from Woody’s personal record collection."
8589,a-walk-in-the-clouds-movie,Hal Hinson,0,"A phenomenally atrocious movie—so bad, in fact, that you might actually manage to squeeze a few laughs out of it."
8590,the-incredibles-2-movie,Oliver Jones,88,This is the rare sequel that packs constant surprises while still delivering on expectations.
8591,confessions-of-a-shopaholic-movie,Jessica Reaves,38,"A thin, largely unfunny comedy that marries lazy filmmaking with bad timing."
8592,road-to-perdition-movie,Stephen Holden,100,A truly majestic visual tone poem.
8593,porto-movie,April Wolfe,30,"All of this is attractive, yet I felt nothing for these people, their pain, or their possible lost future."
8594,nijinsky-the-diaries-of-vaslav-nijinsky-movie,Ted Shen,80,"A treat for balletomanes, this 2001 feature may be too precious for others."
8595,turn-it-up-movie,Stephen Holden,20,Deteriorates into a gory shoot-'em-up gangster movie with a quick-fix ending that leaves many threads dangling. It could have been something more.
8596,sleepover-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,"If ever a movie could be charged with imperiling the morals of a minor, it's probably Sleepover, a sleazy, PG-rated sex comedy that's apparently aimed at 8- to 10-year-old girls. "
8597,pushing-tin-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,30,"Not every stupid film sets out to be that way. But a furious zeal to entertain, especially to find twists, can push filmmakers past credibility, past twist, even past social decency. A dreadful example is Pushing Tin."
8598,the-east-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,75,"It showcases the evolving interests and talents of Zal Batmanglij and Brit Marling, but expands them and channels them into a more traditional thriller framework."
8599,dungeons-dragons-movie,Dennis Lim,0,At once laboriously expository and defiantly incomprehensible.
8600,darkest-hour-movie,Danielle White,78,"I tried to imagine what it would be like watching this movie if I were unfamiliar with the source material. The story may be a bit strange, but certainly no less touching. That’s the thing about classics: Each reiteration, if done properly, puts us closer to the story at heart."
8601,walk-the-line-movie,Mike Clark,88,"A Johnny Cash biopic equally packed with music and frustrated love, Walk the Line goes from compelling to enthralling."
8602,miss-julie-movie,William Arnold,25,As dreary an hour-and-a-half as you could ever want to spend at the movies.
8603,get-carter-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,12,"The result is a throwaway story hidden beneath a messy jumble of weird camera angles, worthless editing tricks and an ill-placed, obnoxious score."
8604,the-crazies-movie,Dennis Harvey,70,Delivers the essential suspense goods with overall skill and a modicum of intelligence.
8605,agent-cody-banks-movie,Karen Heller ,25,"Written and directed on autopilot, containing every cliche endemic to these movies: clueless parents, bratty brother, nasty rich kids, pool fight, food fight, girls who can't drive. "
8606,the-other-side-of-the-bed-movie,Laura Sinagra,10,"If Martínez-Lázaro, as he reiterated at the Miami Film Festival earlier this year, wants to expand the U.S. Spanish-language film market, one hopes he'll aim higher than this."
8607,journey-2-the-mysterious-island-movie,Nathan Rabin,33,"This adventure strands Johnson's famously animated features in eyebrow jail, and squanders his outsized charisma and gift for winking self-deprecation in a thankless worried-stepfather role. It doesn't call for much, beyond a lot of muscles and an ever-present look of concern for his whiny stepson."
8608,the-maid-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"The Maid has that particular gift of leaving you off balance in the best possible way, and whenever something like that comes around you owe it to yourself to check it out."
8609,crush-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"It's about women, but as written and directed by a man, it appears to make no emotional sense at all. It treats women like idiots."
8610,serendipity-movie,Jay Carr,88,"Serendipity returns us, if only for a couple of hours, to the Manhattan of our dreams."
8611,happy-feet-two-movie,Sam Adams,88,"Although it's set on the same frozen continent, Happy Feet Two is worlds away from its predecessor."
8612,get-him-to-the-greek-movie,Peter Rainer,67,Brand can seem simultaneously randy and strung-out and is often very funny. Hill is surprisingly touching.
8613,robin-hood-movie,Anthony Lane,30,"All is dour and dun. We are a long way from Errol Flynn marching in with a deer slung over his shoulder, or from the Fairbanks who didn’t merely scamper and swing from one errand of justice to the next. He SKIPPED."
8614,the-shipping-news-movie,Steven Rea,63,"Despite its haunting artistry and its winning eccentricities, The Shipping News is a vehicle that's still very much at sea."
8615,heartbreakers-movie,Jonathan Foreman,38,"Despite its talented and/or attractive cast, Heartbreakers is an ugly movie: The kind that makes you feel slightly soiled afterwards."
8616,the-second-mother-movie,Peter Keough,88,"A kitchen, a guestroom, and swimming pool become battlegrounds. Though hardly revolutionary, “Mother” subverts conventions — both cinematic and social. "
8617,the-emoji-movie-movie,Andrew Crump,10,The Emoji Movie’s most insidious trait is its surface-level innocuousness.
8618,the-american-astronaut-movie,Gregory Weinkauf,30,"The fleeting moments of dry wit are too sparse to hold the movie together, so instead McAbee takes the kitchen-sink approach, hitting us with whatever he's got."
8619,quantum-of-solace-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"A spastic, indecipherable, unholy, and altogether unwatchable mess."
8620,kikujiro-no-natsu-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"The film isn't just bad; it's a barely coherent, inert mess -- a heart-tugger for voidoids."
8621,the-florida-project-movie,Peter Travers,88,"Willem Dafoe should be on top of Oscar's Best Supporting Actor list for his stellar work in The Florida Project, a film that's as hilarious and heartbreaking as it is unclassifiable."
8622,the-man-movie,Kirk Honeycutt,70,Who knew Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy would make such a dynamic comic duo?
8623,hollow-man-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,Definitely stuck in the fourth grade.
8624,the-perfect-holiday-movie,Connie Ogle,12,A lot like getting socks for Christmas: Better than finding coal in your stocking but not exactly as thrilling as unwrapping a big-screen HDTV.
8625,the-last-airbender-movie,Richard Corliss,0,Surely the worst botch of a fantasy epic.
8626,mein-liebster-feind---klaus-kinski-movie,Michael Blowen,100,"Reflective, haunting, hilarious documentary."
8627,captain-phillips-movie,Bob Mondello,90,"Hanks and Abdi are so compellingly matched that unlike with most thrillers, it won't be the action climax in Captain Phillips that'll stick with you. It'll be that aftermath, which gets at the emotional toll of terrorism in a way few movies have."
8628,titanic-movie,Mike Clark,100,"His (Cameron) movie may not be perfect, but visually and viscerally, it pretty well is."
8629,coming-home-movie,Stephanie Zacharek,90,"Coming Home obviously has historical and political significance for Chinese who lived through the Cultural Revolution, and for families that were torn apart by it. But Zhang tells this particular story in a deeply personal way — the time and place of its setting have a specific meaning, but its emotional contours spread out into something bigger."
8630,the-flintstones-in-viva-rock-vegas-movie,Marc Savlov,0,Even the youngest members of the audience appeared to be more interested in their dwindling soda supply than anything up on the screen. Yabba dabba doom.
8631,enders-game-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Not only does Ender's Game have many scenes in zero gravity, but this zero-sum fiasco has zero drama, zero suspense, zero humor, zero charm and zero appeal."
8632,ripd-movie,Bilge Ebiri,10,"The whole thing seems ill-conceived from the start, unable to keep its parameters simple – think of Ghostbusters and “Don’t cross the streams!” – but also lacking any genuine comic spark or imagination. It’s an exhausting 98 minute ride to nowhere."
8633,the-producers-movie,Peter Rainer,83,"It's a classic example of how a movie can be great without, strictly speaking, being good. But when something is this funny, who wants to speak strictly?"
8634,how-do-you-know-movie,Peter Debruge,30,This wrong-headed dramedy peddles forced warm-fuzziness and insincere sentiment on the backs of an all-star cast. 
8635,the-florida-project-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,"Sometimes infuriating but never depressing, The Florida Project doesn’t just shine a light on people rarely represented in anything but a condescending manner. Instead it brings us into their world and introduces us to its inhabitants in a meaningful way. We care about them."
8636,denial-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,63,"At the nasty center of the otherwise dutiful Denial is a slimy, self-aggrandizing upper-class blowhard of a bigot who believes he has every right to circulate hateful and hurtful falsehoods to his followers."
8637,cocktail-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,0,"Very, very stupid."
8638,the-equalizer-2-movie,Roger Moore,63,"Charisma and old-fashioned talent, what we glibly file under the label “chemistry” when actors click with every single co-star they share a movie with, carry him through in The Equalizer 2, a dawdling thriller that sacrifices thrills, surprises and at times coherence for the sake of character."
8639,series-7-the-contenders-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,20,The movie's bright touches belong primarily to Brooke Smith.
8640,clash-of-the-titans-movie,Dana Stevens,10,"Clash seems to be deliberately steering clear of camp, when in fact it should have steered straight into camp and stepped on the gas."
8641,american-virgin-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,This ''satire'' of triple-X raunch and ''Jerry Springer'' sleaze starts off at a pitch of preening dementia and just grows more hysterical from there.
8642,new-best-friend-movie,Dennis Harvey,10,Obvious and exploitative even by low-bar youthpic standards.
8643,the-33-movie,Glenn Kenny,75,"This unabashedly crowd-pleasing movie gets to its uplifting but also somewhat disquieting conclusion and coda (which, as is the custom these days, introduces the audience to the real-life miners) with its integrity intact. "
8644,what-the-!-do-we-know!-movie,Lou Lumenick,0,Nearly two hours of New Age hooey.
8645,at-any-price-movie,Ella Taylor,80,"Like television's ""Breaking Bad,"" At Any Price is about the slow, insidious corruption of a regular guy, about the rot that grows around him and within him, allowing him to become complicit in a crime of biblical proportions."
8646,the-pianist-movie,Liam Lacey,88,"Polanski's view of life is like that of Greek tragedy, with the same cold comfort that tragedy implies; from the larger perspective which art gives us, we know even horrors eventually pass."
8647,blindness-movie,J.R. Jones,0,"This ends on an uplifting and philosophical note, equating moral blindness with the literal sort, which you'll probably appreciate if you haven't already slit your wrists."
8648,the-big-bang-movie,Nick Schager,20,"Agent-turned-director Tony Krantz has a penchant for stylization that quickly slides into a velvet-painting cheesiness, which-along with the script's pseudoprofound Philosophy 101 maxims-renders the atmosphere less noirish than ridiculously cartoonish."
8649,the-tourist-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"There are all kinds of bad movies in the world, but it's really only stardom that can create the exact variety of cinematic abortion we find in The Tourist."
8650,the-matrix-movie,Keith Phipps,90,"The Wachowskis do it so playfully well, keeping The Matrix's potentially confusing plot intelligible, intelligent, and suspenseful, that it doesn't matter."
8651,babe-pig-in-the-city-movie,Shawn Levy,63,"A dark, violent film, it has undeniable visual power and sporadic moments of wit. There's quite a bit of fun, but it's not the cheery entertainment you might be hoping for from your favorite porker. [25 Nov 1998, p.D1]"
8652,charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-movie,Steven Rea,100,"A mischievously inventive, surreal entertainment, one that celebrates not only Whipple Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight and Nutty Crunch Surprise but Busby Berkeley, Stanley Kubrick, the Beatles, and the outer-space acting choices of one Johnny Depp - not to mention those bushy-tailed rodents in all their bustling splendor."
8653,the-cabin-in-the-woods-movie,Shawn Levy,83,"It's a film full of clever moments that may at first seem cheeky but come to feel inspired, with a third act (which only a churl would describe) that rises to a dizzyingly heightened level of metaphysics and mayhem. "
8654,a-walk-on-the-moon-movie,James Berardinelli,75,Moments of light comedy keeps the tone from becoming too heavy without sabotaging the movie's dramatic underpinning.
8655,how-i-killed-my-father-movie,Kenneth Turan,90,"Truly, there can be nothing as complex as the simplest human relationships, and nothing as satisfying as a film that understands that as this one does."
8656,kangaroo-jack-movie,Jack Mathews,0,It's fitting that the kangaroo gives the most lifelike performance.
8657,stigmata-movie,Lisa Schwarzbaum,16,"A crude, silly supernatural thriller."
8658,youth-without-youth-movie,Owen Gleiberman,0,"The movie is one soporific, depressed, deadeningly vague scene after another."
8659,the-weather-man-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"In The Weather Man, Nicolas Cage, a great oddball movie star who sometimes takes enormous risks, has a good, risky part again."
8660,an-education-movie,Shawn Levy,100,"It is, in its quiet, precise, classical way, nearly perfect."
8661,slackers-movie,Desson Thomson,10,How bad is it? Let me count just some of the ways.
8662,the-young-victoria-movie,Mike Scott,75,"As engrossing as The Young Victoria is, this isn't a movie that will stay with you very long. Mostly that's because Blunt's character does little by way of evolving."
8663,left-luggage-movie,Leslie Camhi,70,"Krabbé alternates exaggeration with sentiment, but the main characters are relatively complex, and its surprise ending is genuinely affecting."
8664,ali-movie,J. Hoberman,70,Filled with vivid cameos and set to an infectious soul beat that effectively covers the underlying hum of calculated precision.
8665,maria-full-of-grace-movie,Rene Rodriguez,75,"Shot in the style of a documentary, which lends the movie an aura of utter realism, Maria Full of Grace derives an unsettling power from the clinical details of Maria's ordeal."
8666,miracles-from-heaven-movie,Joey Nolfi,16,"Miracles From Heaven stands firm atop a sloppily made case for faith over logic and spirituality over science, and for that, it’s challenging to view as a film instead of judgmental ideology in cinematic drag."
8667,terminal-movie,Peter Travers,0,"Yes, you read that correctly: zero stars. When talented people create one of the worst movies ever made, you have to ask: What the hell happened? "
8668,eight-legged-freaks-movie,Steven Rea,75,"The movie's combination of unabashedly fun carnage, cool special effects, and tongue-in-cheek dialogue keeps the ball rolling (albeit at reduced speed), until the last of the titular terrors has bit the dust."
8669,unforgiven-movie,Staff (Not Credited),100,"The cast is universally strong. Hackman, Freeman and Harris don't do anything they haven't done before, but the roles suit their personae to a degree where they approach archetypal status."
8670,ask-the-dust-movie,Owen Gleiberman,25,The movie lacks even the misplaced fervor of obsession. It's lifeless kitsch.
8671,a-view-to-a-kill-movie,Peter Travers,38,"What's good? A mesmeric, bottle-blond Christopher Walken as Max Zorin, hellbent on global domination as a product of Nazi experiments, Grace Jones' zowie star at his henchman, and Duran Duran's title song. Otherwise, I'm out."
8672,the-artist-movie,Joe Morgenstern,80,"Silence makes the film interesting by enticing us to concentrate in ways we're not used to, while artistry carries the day. The Artist may have started as a daring stunt, but it elevates itself to an endearing - and probably enduring - delight."
8673,winters-bone-movie,Rick Groen,75,"This is a world out of time and, despite the trappings of flinty realism, the film too unfolds like an elemental myth from the stormy past – a Greek tragedy driven by dark fates and struggling toward a catharsis."
8674,two-girls-and-a-guy-movie,Elvis Mitchell,70,"Robert Downey Jr.'s Blake Allen is enough of a raging dynamo to find the dark humor and desperate romanticism at the heart of Mr. Toback's ego trip of a premise, and to make Blake sympathetic too."
8675,dinosaur-movie,Owen Gleiberman,83,"Doesn't offer anything to adult viewers as thrilling, as shivery, as satisfyingly primal as Steven Spielberg's intricate predator choreography in the original ''Jurassic Park.''"
8676,fair-game-movie,Peter Travers,12,"Fair Game, written and directed by men, allows model Cindy Crawford to make her screen debut as Miami lawyer Kate McQueen."
8677,jesus-camp-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,75,What most interests the directors is the way young minds are shaped by adults with clear moral and political agendas.
8678,because-of-winn-dixie-movie,Desson Thomson,70,Robb is remarkably assured; there isn't a false note in her performance.
8679,agnes-browne-movie,William Arnold,67,Anges has nothing but affection for its characters and fondness for their quirkiness.
8680,the-man-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,10,"I haven't seen such meaningful insight into the nature of human cooperation since this morning's ""Sesame Street."""
8681,maudie-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"Frankly, we are left with nothing, except with a movie that insists that we love it — or worse, assumes we will — because its subject is so worthy. Even on that score, that of convincing us of the worthiness of its subject, Maudie falls down."
8682,taken-3-movie,Maggie Lee,30,"A mind-numbing, crash-bang misfire that abandons chic European capitals for the character’s own backyard."
8683,jet-lag-movie,Jack Mathews,38,"Who knew that Juliette Binoche and Jean Reno could be unlikable? And yet, there they are, grating on each other's nerves (and ours) as strandees at Charles De Gaulle airport. "
8684,and-so-it-goes-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,30,There is very little on the screen to capture your attention.
8685,kidnap-movie,David Ehrlich,16,"The Emoji Movie might have been a boring and brazenly cynical piece of corporate propaganda, but at least it had the courtesy to be offensive. Kidnap, on the other hand, doesn’t have the the courtesy to be much of anything."
8686,never-again-movie,Stephen Hunter,10,"A meet-cute whimsy set among divorced fifty-somethings in New York, it blunders on toward oblivion, excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic."
8687,little-women-movie,Matt Zoller Seitz,90,"It respects its characters, its source material, and its audience, and its inherent melodrama is ennobled by the scrupulous intelligence of its director."
8688,who-is-cletis-tout-movie,Luke Y. Thompson,20,"What it lacks are solid performances, save Slater's game attempt to take everything seriously."
8689,sleep-furiously-movie,David Fear,80,Gideon Koppel's free-form portrait of a Welsh farming community may be the most subtly poetic piece of cine-anthropology to come down the pike in eons.
8690,the-collection-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,"The Collection is bloody, disgusting and ridiculous, but the one thing it's not is horror, not real horror, not in the sense of tense or scary. It's not cinema, either. It's not even fun."
8691,dirty-grandpa-movie,Frank Scheck,10,It can be definitively stated that Dirty Grandpa is utterly unfunny.
8692,hillarys-america-the-secret-history-of-the-democratic-party-movie,Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,0,"Hillary’s America is repugnant, and while it exists to get people who stand against it yelled at as much as anything, it’s essential that D’Souza not simply be written off as a hack pandering to a willing and lucrative audience regardless of the moral implications, though he is. D’Souza peddles the kind of “media” that’s become cancerous to the country he unyieldingly purports to worship."
8693,fresh-dressed-movie,Stephanie Merry,75,"The film doesn’t always dig deeply, glossing over why certain trends have emerged. And some of the interviews don’t add much to the movie beyond star power. Fresh Dressed nevertheless offers an original and worthwhile look at the history of hip-hop style. And the soundtrack doesn’t hurt either."
8694,you-dont-mess-with-the-zohan-movie,Mick LaSalle,25,"Serious intent may be lurking somewhere in there, but it's buried under layers of stupidity - not just stupid jokes, which is what you want from Sandler, but also stupid, shallow thinking."
8695,harlem-nights-movie,Hal Hinson,10,"Eddie Murphy's directorial work is amateurish at best. And as a performer he looks as if he is in agony, as if his mother made him stand in front of the camera for punishment."
8696,the-shape-of-water-movie,Guy Lodge,100,"Perhaps the greatest of The Shape of Water’s many surprises is how extravagantly romantic it is, driven throughout by an all-conquering belief in soulmates as lifelines."
8697,casa-de-mi-padre-movie,Joe Neumaier,20,It's an unfunny Spanish movie that worked best as a two-minute trailer.
8698,dinosaur-movie,Susannah Breslin,75,Does exactly what it should: Take the wee ones on a vicarious trip through an adventure both visually terrifying and emotionally thrilling at the same time.
8699,taxi-2015-movie,Deborah Young,90,"Amazingly, Panahi turns the utterly simple, economical format of a camera inside a car into something relevant to his own artistic state and full of eye-opening insights into Iranian society."
8700,ernest-goes-to-jail-movie,Ty Burr,25,"The script tries to work up sympathy for a character who’s not much more than the bastard trailer-park spawn of Jerry Lewis. Sadly, this is everything you ever thought an Ernest movie would be."
8701,rosetta-movie,Jay Carr,88,"The bleakness of Rosetta will not be for all, but it's one of the best films of the year."
8702,mrs-doubtfire-movie,Brian Lowry,90,"Director Chris Columbus shrewdly brings together many of the same selling points as in his ""Home Alone"" movies, mixing broad comedic strokes with heavy-handed messages about the magical power of family."
8703,cotton-mary-movie,Wesley Morris,63,Really just a lurid potboiler.
8704,beyond-borders-movie,Jack Mathews,38,Of this much I'm sure: It's an awful movie.
8705,another-year-movie,Bill Goodykoontz,90,"The acting is uniformly terrific, just a marvel to watch."
8706,the-third-man-movie,John Hartl,100,"The Third Man has so many captivating elements that it's often thought of as a romantic movie. Maybe that's the result of Welles' involvement in a radio show in which his movie character, Harry Lime, became significantly more heroic, or the television series in which Michael Rennie took over the role. [30 July 1999, p.H1]"
8707,house-of-sand-and-fog-movie,Peter Rainer,80,The performances are amazing.
8708,american-ultra-movie,Peter Hartlaub,75,"The screenplay is deceptively tight, even as the main characters seem to be buzzing aimlessly through the proceedings. Like the most successful films of the drug-hazed genre, this movie only appears to be going off the rails."
8709,infinitely-polar-bear-movie,Joshua Rothkopf,80,"Ruffalo, a master of rumpled befuddlement, finds his signature role here—it can't be overstated how deftly he eases into the tricky creation, a blue-blooded slacker who aches when the world won't hug him back."
8710,pina-movie,Leslie Felperin,90,"Offering further proof that the latest 3D technology is good for a lot more than just lunging knives and fantastical storylines, Wim Wenders' dance docu Pina reps multidimensional entertainment that will send culture vultures swooning."
8711,the-loss-of-a-teardrop-diamond-movie,Lou Lumenick,38,Seems almost like a self-parody of Williams' earlier work.
8712,the-joy-luck-club-movie,Jonathan Rosenbaum,100,A highly emotional epic about what it means to be both Chinese and American.
8713,all-eyez-on-me-movie,Stephen Dalton,30,"Given the tragic and highly charged events it depicts, All Eyez on Me is oddly low on emotional bite, perhaps because it never feels real. As clean and polished and blandly overlit as a TV soap opera, Boom’s film looks and feels smaller than Tupac’s cinematic life story."
8714,insidious-the-last-key-movie,Roger Moore,38,"A movie that has no right to the touching finale Whannell cooks up, a nice payoff to a movie that isn’t really worth sitting through to reach that payoff."
8715,she-hate-me-movie,Peter Travers,25,"When a Spike Lee film doesn't fly, it sinks like a stone. "
8716,trainspotting-movie,John Leland,80,"Artfully ambivalent, Danny Boyle's film, twists with a junkie's logic. It does not preach; it wallows in the pain and, more daringly, in the pleasure."
8717,london-has-fallen-movie,Stephanie Merry,12,London Has Fallen is remarkable only because of how much worse it is than its inane predecessor.
8718,dragonfly-movie,Dana Stevens,10,"As the movie dragged on, I thought I heard a mysterious voice, and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign. I have returned from the beyond to warn you: this movie is 90 minutes long, and life is too short."
8719,maladies-movie,Rex Reed,0,"Overrated, overexposed and overindulgent, James Franco is all over the place, like cow chips in the abandoned pasture of a derelict farm."
8720,dont-think-twice-movie,Chuck Bowen,75,It displays an intimate chemical understanding of the exhausting and unrelentingly impotent agony of failure.
8721,snowpiercer-movie,Roger Moore,88,It’s more an instant cult film than a picture with any prayer of reaching millions.
8722,the-coldest-city-movie,Britt Hayes,80,"Charlize Theron is the hero we need right now: As devilishly self-serving and smooth as Bond, as physically dynamic and stoic as Wick, Lorraine is confidently equipped to join the legacy of great movie action heroes and she doesn’t need your permission to do it."
8723,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,Mick LaSalle,100,"The storytelling in The Force Awakens is masterful, in that it seems to be taking its time but is always moving relentlessly forward and coming up with surprises. "
8724,clay-pigeons-movie,Bob Graham,75,It's got unpredictable plot twists and unexpected laughs coming out of dark corners. The sharp-edged film also looks terrific.
8725,uptown-girls-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,38,"Frankly, you may prefer the company of cinematic serial killers (Freddy vs. Jason) after you meet the pair at the center of this story."
8726,maleficent-movie,R. Kurt Osenlund,38,"We may have all wanted to know the story behind those famed horns, but the mystery was far preferable to having Maleficent de-fanged and de-clawed in the process."
8727,a-time-for-drunken-horses-movie,Michael Wilmington,88,"Showing us a world through a child's eyes, A Time for Drunken Horses speaks so truthfully and well that it breaks the heart and scars the conscience."
8728,hick-movie,Rachel Saltz,30,"Ms. Portes's script strains credulity, and it's not helped by Mr. Martini, who can't find the right tone. "
8729,kitchen-stories-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"The icy whimsy of Kitchen Stories is certainly well sustained, but you don't laugh at the movie so much as wait for the joke to thaw."
8730,the-replacements-movie,Andrew O'Hehir,0,The worst movie of the new millennium.
8731,till-human-voices-wake-us-movie,Michael Dequina,20,"The love story that is supposed to drive the film fails to ignite a single spark--and, hence, the film fails to generate a single iota of interest from the viewer. "
8732,the-way-of-the-gun-movie,Mary Elizabeth Williams,10,"The directorial debut of the writer of ""The Usual Suspects"" keeps tossing the genre hand grenades one might expect, but they all wind up duds."
8733,a-sound-of-thunder-movie,Wesley Morris,12,The movie fails to conjure the wonder of the Ray Bradbury short story that inspired it.
8734,nine-lives-2016-movie,Susan Wloszczyna,0,Let’s just say I have been to wakes that have elicited more laughs.
8735,secretary-movie,James Berardinelli,88,"Has enough genuine laughs to eliminate the potential twitters and snickers, and it treats Edward and Lee as people. We end up caring about what happens to these two individuals, even as we smile and laugh at their antics."
8736,the-neon-demon-movie,Tasha Robinson,64,"The heavy threat of sexual assault, physical consumption, and predatory control hangs over the film's treacherous first hour, but once the threat resolves, Neon Demon loses its tension and its power, and then just keeps going."
8737,mile-22-movie,Vince Mancini,67,Mile 22 is such a freakish chimera of disparate genre influences that it’s kind of fascinating.
8738,men-women-children-movie,Chris Cabin,12,"Jason Reitman fails to take into account any of the positive endeavors enabled by social media, which will no doubt be used to promote and market his film."
8739,101-reykjavik-movie,Marjorie Baumgarten,67,The tone of the film is in keeping with its most resounding image: Hilynur lying in the snow with a cigarette dangling from his mouth as the suicide note on his chest blows away in the wind as he wakes up.
8740,because-of-winn-dixie-movie,Liam Lacey,38,"The problem is that director Wayne Wang seems deaf to the tonal differences between coming-of-age, magic realism and children's comedy."
8741,monkey-shines-movie,Rob Beattie,100,"Getting the best out of a middling novel, Romero finds new, less gruesome avenues for his skills."
8742,miles-ahead-movie,Manohla Dargis,90,"Does it matter that stretches of Miles Ahead — a gun-rattling, squealing-tire car chase included — came out of the filmmakers’ imagination rather than Davis’s life? (Mr. Cheadle shares script credit with Steven Baigelman.) Purists may howl, but they’ll also miss the pleasure and point of this playfully impressionistic movie."
8743,broadway-danny-rose-movie,Staff (Not Credited),70,"Broadway Danny Rose is a delectable diversion which allows Woody Allen to present a reasonably humane, and amusing gentle character study without sacrificing himself to overly commercial concerns."
8744,fellini-im-a-born-liar-movie,Stanley Kauffmann,90,"It is Fellini's face that is peculiarly welcome, the face that -- in a probably fantasizing but pertinent way -- endorses his films."
8745,catwoman-movie,Owen Gleiberman,67,"I wouldn't call Catwoman incompetent, yet it has no visual grandeur, and very little surprise; you can tick off the story beats as if they'd been graphed."
8746,in-the-line-of-fire-movie,Staff (Not credited),88,"The result is a finely tuned suspense thriller, though executives who have recently laid off trained killers may experience some discomfort."
8747,spider-man-2-movie,Pete Vonder Haar,80,"It’s easily the best movie of the summer so far. Sony has obviously given Raimi more freedom to run the show, and the results are very entertaining."
8748,3000-miles-to-graceland-movie,Joe Morgenstern,10,"Nothing but miscalculation from clumsy start to chaotic finish, an action thriller with a cynical, shriveled soul."
8749,cedar-rapids-movie,Mick LaSalle,75,In addition to being funny and endearing and having a lively script and lots of nicely observed performances - is something of an education.
8750,john-wick-movie,Tom Russo,63,"The movie’s one big pitfall, really, is that Reeves’s character is so intently focused, he takes care of business a bit too quickly. Some final skirmishing and a tonally false sign-off feel like unconvincing bids to stretch the story to a more legit feature length."
8751,the-accidental-tourist-movie,Pauline Kael,10,I found Tourist hell to sit through. [23 Jan 1989]
8752,teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movie,Joe Neumaier,0,"The cloddish, confusing action scenes make no sense. Young viewers’ eyes will glaze from the first-person video-game style. Nonaction scenes feature people sniping at each other, or, in Arnett’s case, croaking out the script’s half-assed witticisms, until the Turtles show up."
8753,the-lego-movie-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,It's hard to think of the last time a Pixar film made you go ''Wow!'' That's part of why The LEGO Movie is such outrageous and intoxicating fun.
8754,beauty-and-the-beast-1991-movie,Duane Byrge,100,"Disney's 30th animated feature, Beauty and the Beast stands at the pinnacle of animated accomplishment, even when weighted against the excellencies of its lineage."
8755,even-cowgirls-get-the-blues-movie,James Berardinelli,12,Even Cowgirls is as close to an unwatchable film as there is available at this time in the theaters.
8756,brooklyns-finest-movie,Peter Travers,0,"Simultaneously full of itself and full of sh--, Brooklyn's Finest is a cop movie so shallow, dumb, derivative and infuriating that it feels like a parody of bad cop movies."
8757,bloody-sunday-movie,Owen Gleiberman,100,"It's a mad cycle of arrogance and despair, and Bloody Sunday etches it onto your nervous system."
8758,ready-player-one-movie,Tasha Robinson,81,"The sheer dynamism and energy of the movie are compelling, even when the character drama isn’t."
8759,final-destination-movie,Kevin Maynard,12,Crude and witless.
8760,driven-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,10,"An appallingly dull film set in the world of professional racing, director Renny Harlin and screenwriter Sylvester Stallone have found a way to drain all the adrenaline out of the sport."
8761,the-sweetest-thing-movie,A.O. Scott,10,"After about 20 minutes of ""Thing,"" a concussion begins to look enormously appealing."
8762,2016-obamas-america-movie,Alan Scherstuhl,10,The only true surprise here is D'Souza's haplessness in constructing both film and argument.
8763,star-wars-episode-iv---a-new-hope-movie,Kathleen Carroll,90,"Star Wars is somewhat grounded by a malfunctioning script and hopelessly infantile dialogue, but from a technical standpoint, it is an absolutely breathtaking achievement."
8764,a-separation-movie,Richard Corliss,100,"However ripe A Separation might seem for being adapted into a smart American film, Hollywood shouldn't bother. Farhadi's movie is just about perfect as it is."
8765,kangaroo-jack-movie,Kimberley Jones,11,"Indeed, the largely computer-generated Jack acts the pants off his co-stars, which can and should be taken with a whole trough full of salt."
8766,call-me-by-your-name-movie,Jordan Hoffman,100,Call Me By Your Name is a masterful work because of the specificity of its details. 
8767,the-avengers-movie,Manohla Dargis,10,It's shockingly inert. 
8768,ballistic-ecks-vs-sever-movie,Wesley Morris,12,"Banderas slums through this dollar-bin action flick wearing the same look of wiped-out exasperation that Danny Glover's Sergeant Murtaugh sports in each installment of ''Lethal Weapon.'' And like Murtaugh, Banderas might be too old for this, too."
8769,are-we-there-yet-movie,Mick LaSalle,0,Four screenwriters are credited with this sloppy piece of work. Divide the embarrassment into quarters.
8770,standing-in-the-shadows-of-motown-movie,David Sterritt,100,Rollicking documentary that will have your toes tapping and your ears sizzling whether you're a die-hard Motown fan or not.
8771,jaws-the-revenge-movie,Jay Boyar,12,"Abetter title for Jaws The Revenge would be Jaws The Refund. A refund is what a lot of people who go to see this picture will demand. This Time It's Personal, the tag line for the new film's ad campaign, doesn't seem quite right either. This Time It's Terrible would have been more accurate."
8772,twelve-movie,Elizabeth Weitzman,0,"""If you don't want something,"" Twelve informs us, ""you've got nothing."" Well, I wanted to watch a good movie. But Joel Schumacher's shallow teen drama gave me nothing, instead."
8773,snatch-movie,Marc Savlov,89,"Snatch is nothing if not watchable: It has the insane, popcorn rhythms of a Road Runner cartoon, and for that reason alone it's a minor masterpiece."
8774,waiting-movie,Kimberley Jones,0,Never aims higher than the urinal.
8775,gemini-movie,Peter Debruge,90,"For a director who emerged from indie film’s so-called “mumblecore” movement, Gemini feels like a grown-up achievement, and the sign of a director with so much more to give in the future."
8776,crash-1997-movie,Richard Corliss,10,"An intellectual and a sensualist, Cronenberg graces Crash with philosophical musings, acres of pretty flesh and even more penis talk than on some 8 o'clock sitcoms. For all that, Crash doesn't work."
8777,blue-jasmine-movie,Ben Kenigsberg,83,"Unlikely as it may seem, though, Blue Jasmine finds Allen charting bona fide new territory."
8778,gotti-movie,Glenn Kenny,0,That the long-gestating crime drama Gotti is a dismal mess comes as no surprise. What does shock is just how multifaceted a dismal mess it is.
8779,the-man-movie,Robert Wilonsky,10,"Indeed, this is the very kind of lame-brained folly Levy and his SCTV cohorts used to mock on their old show; now it's how he makes rent."
8780,corky-romano-movie,Desson Thomson,10,"It's depressing enough to sit through an unfunny comedy, but it's worse to watch Falk, Penn and Berg having to earn a living like this."
8781,faceoff-movie,Andy Seiler,88,It could be argued that this movie's callousness toward human life is nihilistic and nasty. But Woo takes everything so absurdly far that audiences laugh at what horrified them moments before. [27Jun1997 Pg01.D]
8782,frankenweenie-movie,Drew Taylor,91,"It says something, then, that Burton's best, most enjoyable, and most emotionally resonate film in years is actually an adaptation of one of his very first projects: Frankenweenie."
8783,therese-movie,Joe Morgenstern,0,"Whatever possessed the people who made this film to believe its ponderous style would appeal to contemporary audiences? One answer may lie in a variant of the mostly true proposition that no one sets out to make a bad film. No one chooses ponderousness as a goal; it comes unbidden, with deadly earnestness."
8784,vatel-movie,Peter Travers,10,This putrid dish marks a new low for director Roland Joffe.
8785,into-the-woods-movie,Stephen Holden,90,"Into the Woods, the splendid Disney screen adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical, infuses new vitality into the tired marketing concept of entertainment for “children of all ages.” That usually translates to mean only children and their doting parents. But with Into the Woods, you grow up with the characters, young and old, in a lifelong process of self-discovery."
8786,lets-be-cops-movie,Jason Clark,0,"If Let's Be Cops were content to be simply an unfunny genre exercise, it would be easy to dismiss it and move on. But the sting of astoundingly ill-advised sexism and homophobia is harder to shake."
8787,soul-man-movie,Rita Kempley,10,"Howell, a second-string Rob Lowe, has the title role in this embarrassing variation on ""Black Like Me,"" a half-witted collegiate farce guaranteed to offend just about everybody. Blacks are stereotyped as they haven't been in decades, and whites are portrayed as Boston bigots and selfish preppies. But the really pathetic thing about this tired old knee-jerker is not that it's racist, but that it's racist and doesn't even know it."
8788,josie-and-the-pussycats-movie,Lisa Alspector,10,The insultingly trendy post-postmodern tale rationalizes its own product placement by using overkill.
8789,the-uninvited-movie,Adam Markovitz,16,"Horror standbys like mangled corpses and stone-faced children pop up regularly, but sibling directors Charles and Thomas Guard haven't quite nailed the genre's rhythms."
8790,beverly-hills-cop-iii-movie,Caryn James,10,"Beverly Hills Cop III is a generic action movie, an Eddie Murphy film with only a trace of Eddie Murphy."

8793,some-kind-of-beautiful-movie,Justin Chang,0,"From first frame to last, “Some Kind of Beautiful” is some kind of hideous, a perfect storm of romantic-comedy awfulness that seems to set the ailing genre back decades with the sheer force of its ineptitude."
8794,the-banger-sisters-movie,Michael O'Sullivan,10,"From opening to closing credits, there isn't a single genuine moment -- as phony as a dime bag of oregano."
8795,arthur-christmas-movie,Kyle Smith,12,"Ho-ho-huh? Arthur Christmas is an animated kiddie comedy that delivers all the wonder you'd expect in a movie about a guy delivering one package. Maybe they should have called it ""UPS Man: The Movie."""
