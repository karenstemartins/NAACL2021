1,world-war-z-movie,TheKingJack,3,"It's absolutely awful. It takes nothing from the incredible source material authored by Max Brooks, discarding it as if it's irreverent. I've been waiting for this film for the last seven years, but i've got to say, I am incredibly disappointed. That said, Brad Pitt puts in a decent performance as the main protagonist ('Gerry Lane, a UN worker), and some of the scenes work well. Where was Yonkers?"
2,harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2-movie,mburley,2,"This movie wasn't good. Daniel Radcliffe is probably the worst screen actor of all time, to the point where it's actually painful to watch.  And the liberties that were taken with details from the book just boggle my mind.  Little details from the book that would easily translate into a movie were changed or removed. WHY? Why do people blindly love this movie so much? It doesn't make any sense to me."
3,knocked-up-movie,JackM.,2," A few laughs, with Seth Rogan a welcome presence, but ultimately it was predictable, boring in spots, and sentimental. 40 Year Old Virgin was great. This is most certainly not."
4,seven-pounds-movie,JohnS.,3," This movie is Chicken Soup for the Soul ""on steroids"". Nice storyline but then gets crazy by the ending."
5,assault-on-precinct-13-movie,Bill,2," terrible film, completely unbelievable storyline, one dimensional characters, unimpressive action sequences its got the lot. Go see 16 blocks instead."
6,evil-dead-2013-movie,derektripp,8,"The original Evil Dead film is now commonly know by the members of it's wide spread cult, as one of the most influential horror films of all time, and that is one of the main stepping stones to modern horror, an extremely violent film with a bite for comedy and satire. many forget that when it first came out, the only intentions that the film had were to frighten you senselessly, with a unflinchingly grotesque imagery of blood and gore. much of the humor and surreals often associated with the film did not show until the legendary evil dead 2. the new film, from first time feature film director Fede Alverez, doesn't try to compare to the comedy of evil dead 2, but to go head to head at increasing the violence of the original, and at that, the new film succeeds. setting up a story that you will instantly recognize, with a few slight differences, 5 post college students go to an abandoned cabin in the woods to wean on of the members of of their drug addiction. prepared for the worst, the group braces themselves for the withdrawal from the drugs to kick in, and make a vow to not leave until the drug addict has recovered. The slight changes to the typical story work to the films favor  changing the characters from the 5 caricatures of horror films (look into ""the cabin in the woods"" for an example of them), and, while not exactly crafting fully believable people, it at least avoid to many of the stereotypes that plague the genre. Placing one of the characters as a drug addict also explains the reason why they are so situated on remain there, even when the situation goes bad. While these enhancements may flesh out the story a bit, that wouldn't matter at all if the film itself wasn't scary and intense, which, thankfully, it is. once the violence and demonic possession start, the violence of it never lets up. constricted th a tight 91 minute running time, the film never slows down, always setting up the next violence set piece to come just a minute later. The violence itself obviously wishes to live up to the originals brilliant use of all kinds of gore, and at that the film also excels. by far this is the most extreme horror film to hit wide releases in quite some time, with all kinds of violence to quench the appetites of horror fans, and to nauseate the people who weren't expecting it. frequently, the films violence is so over the top, that it stops becoming frightening, and just becomes almost cartooning in the amount of blood that is splatted through the film. Overall, the film is an intense, uncompromising horror film, set only to terrify and nauseate, which is exactly what the original would have wanted."
7,the-lone-ranger-movie,NinaC,2,"Its a slapstick comedy, a somber tale of discrimination and abuse, a tale of revenge, of forbidden love, of mystical creatures, of lost idealism, of greed......in short its a bit of a dizzying mess."
8,thor-ragnarok-movie,Jodle,3,Movie does no justice to its name. How can a movie about Ragnarok(apocalypse) be a comedy? And Tessa Thompson is big miscast in this movie she dont look like Valkyrie.
9,lars-and-the-real-girl-movie,MarianneB.,10, Lovely movie. Laughed. Cried. Satisfied. Ryan Gosling was spectacular.
10,dear-john-movie,RodrigoBGC,1,"Terribly boring, nonsense romance, terrible dialogs, terrible actors, terrible everything!!! everything in is this movies is boring and stupid and so wrong, if you want to see a good love story better see Casablanca or Before Sunrise, those are good love films"
11,dunkirk-movie,ARBonaventura,2,"I pride myself on my judgement of movies and Metacritic nearly never fails me, yet it did this time. I am blown away by the ""professional"" critic reviews. It just does not make sense and I find myself sitting here wondering what is wrong with everyone. The other reviews below consistent question of ""was this the same movie I watched?"" ring so true. It was plain bad, and I cannot for the life of me understand why the ""critics"" thought it good. Were they paid off? Were they caught up in the Nolan hype? There were so many fallacies and inconsistencies in this movie that I do not want to cover them all, but I really felt the need to say... Please do not waste your money if you are an intelligent, analytical, deep, perceptive adult... This movie is not for you. If you are a teenage boy or someone who just needs to turn their brain off for two hours and watch stuff happen in front of them, this movie may be for you. It is not a logically executed, well written, or intellectually / emotionally stimulating movie. It is shallow, dry, and poor from start to finish. War is hell, and this movie did not have the emotional capacity or grit to show that reality."
12,knocked-up-movie,beingryanjude,3,"I'm waiting for when Seth Rogen will grow out of the stoner comedy phase of his career... I think he might actually be talented. For now, I just don't quite get it."
13,steve-jobs-movie,ahnehnois,7,"It's a weird movie. I'd call it a pretty poor biopic, but then it seems not really intended to fill that niche anyway. Instead, it's a philosophical piece on the nature of genius. Does great progress require that one dreamer be so stubborn and such an  that nothing will take his eyes off the prize? There are elements of truth, but many of the factual details are just wrong, and it's hard to say whether the character in the film is a fair portrait of the real man or not. Michael Fassbender does not particularly look or sounds like Steve Jobs, but he's certainly playing something interesting. The odd notion of using hurried discussions before product launches as a framing device is a pretty effective tool, but renders the film incomplete. After all, there were many more important things that happened than can fit into the length of the film. It's a Danny Boyle joint, so you know it's high energy and fun to watch. Go in with measured expectations and you're likely to be happy."
14,zombieland-movie,BillE,9," This was just a fun, escapist movie, that delivered on the promise. I had a smile on my face the whole time. It was exactly what I expected and sometimes that isn't bad thing."
15,the-wrestler-movie,CarolS,9, Really outstanding movie. Rourke and Marisa T. were superbly cast for this. You'll remember its sweetness long after it is over.
16,greenberg-movie,Evolutionary,9,"This should be nominated for Best Drama. Baumbach has a great skill in creating character nuance that is not always pleasant, but certainly realistic. Those unaware of their own personality blind spots will feel uncomfortable during this movie. However, Greenberg is fully formed and expertly played by Stiller. There is a part of Greenberg in all of us."
17,les-miserables-movie,JenJen387,10,"Flawless LIVE acting and even singing. Each cast member proved worthy of their parts. I believe this movie deserves a much better rating considering all of the effort put into this movie. Even the barricade was real! Regardless, this is the first time they ever turned a musical into a movie and I think they exceeded their standards. This movie is a masterpeice, truly outstanding work. This movie got me crying so much, it's like they put their heart and soul into this production. I really hope they continue to do this to other musicals as well."
18,interstellar-movie,surendharobin,10,"Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film. Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece. This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."
19,pompeii-movie,TVJerry,3,"This is basically a hackneyed gladiator movie with a volcano at the end. Kit Harington plays a slave who fights his way into Pompeii's big arena, but not before he falls for the daughter of a prominent local merchant. Meanwhile, Kiefer Sutherland makes an embarrassingly out-of-place villainous Roman senator. The writing and plot are as preposterous as they sound, so it's up to the big blowout to save the day (or ruin it for the citizens). While it's always fun to watch destruction on a grand scale, this eruption is a yawn. Surprisingly, Paul W.S. Anderson, who has given us the beautifully designed and elegantly violent Resident Evil series, has fallen flat this time. Interesting note: Julian Fellowes (creator of ""Downton Abbey"") is credited as one of 4 screenwriters."
20,argo-movie,Cinemaphile,7,"Docudramas often do not lend themselves naturally to action or suspense without omitting mundane detail or using editing to build suspense where no immediate jeopardy actually existed. Argo, Ben Affleck's recreation of the escape of 6 embassy workers from Iran in 1980 is guilty on all counts. Unlike a similar period pic, Zodiac - Argo doesn't capture the feeling of the time, it seems more like a department store window display. Oddly enough, the copious inclusion of all the skiffy kitch from the era works against this film. Affleck does gets strong, workmanlike performances from a cast that uncannily resembles their real life counterparts, but unfortunately he cannot string those scenes together into a cohesive narrative. That in itself is forgivable, but one cannot help but feel that the three key action sequences were given the Hollywood treatment to turn a story more akin to Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy into The Great Escape. Affleck's greatest sin is giving Iranian automobiles nitrus oxide turbocharged engines to keep pace with a Swiss Air 747. One can almost hear the strains of John Barry's Bond theme in the background. Argo isn't a bad movie, nor is it a great one. It is worth the animated history lesson of British and American Cold War meddling in Iran's politics at the beginning of the film. Not worth a full price ticket, but worth afternoon matinee price or pay per view in a month or so."
21,ice-age-collision-course-movie,PabloBird22,3,"Ice age!!! What happend to you?! You were cool before with your three last movies!! but now look what have you done you finished this franchise in the worst way, Guys!! as it says Robbie Rotten ""Don't let your kids watch it"""
22,the-lego-batman-movie,NerdConsultant,8,"Lego Batman is just the film I needed at just the right time.  It’s good, funny and it’s just a plain delight to watch.  It has a few issues, mainly to do with the jokes and the plot doesn’t entirely work as a whole and it’s not as creative as the Lego movie.  But really, those are nit picks.  I actually think this is a good time out and I think kids will enjoy it, their parents will enjoy it and I think comic fans will get something out of it as well.  It’s well animated, for the most part well written and it’s very well acted.  If you like Batman and you liked Lego Movie, this is one to add to your collection or to try and see when it is out in cinemas."
23,daddy-day-care-movie,MovieGuys,0,"Like the universal motto for the war against drugs, ""Just say no"" to this crash-and-burn Eddie Murphy movie. It is disgustingly horrible, abysmal, and unfunny. Steer clear."
24,iron-man-3-movie,DMan11,2,"Mannnn, this movie stunk!  Is Stan Lee going senile or something?  How much money did Hollywood pay him (or drug him) to allow them to wreck the Mandarin villain like that?  The plot drug on too much in the beginning, the PTSD thing Tony Starks suffers from blows, and the villain twist was just lame.  This comic-book hero movie has for the first time made me hope this trendy movie fad dies a quick death now. Downey looks old and tired and I liked him as an actor in the first Ironman and others, but they need to weld the iron door shut on this series for good my goodness.  Anyone saying this movie is good must be easily entertained."
25,winters-tale-movie,just-mike,10,"I'm honestly not quite sure what people were expecting when they watched this movie and as a result gave it such poor ratings. I had never read the book, so I had no expectations. Thus, I found the film wonderful. It was a fantastic movie of a modern fairy tale with magic and slight thread of good versus evil.None of the performances felt forced, even if Crowe's Pearly Soames chewed the scenery a bit, I think that was part of the charm to have a villain that's a bit over the top.I loved the mythology presented, and the simple ways it interacts with the characters. It's not overpowering or intrusive, it's just part of the story, the fabric of the tapestry they are all in.Lighten up, folks. It was a good movie. Just enjoy it."
26,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,fishfrozen,1,"I really hate this movie. Full of plot holes! If light speed traveling could turn a ship into a light speed torpedo, why bother with all these fragile battleships? Just make more light speed torpedoes!!!"
27,despicable-me-2-movie,dpila33,8,I took my family to see it and we all loved it; even my three year old sat still through the entire thing. The minions are hilarious and Gru is a more likable character this time around. definitely recommend this one to any fan of animation.
28,casino-royale-movie,CalebM.,2," For a movie, its all right, but for a bond movie i thought it was terrible. About 3/4 of this movie is him sitting at a table playing poker. Where are the Gadgets? why did he wreck his car after 10 seconds of driving? I can hardly consider this movie a bond movie, it was just another action movie. Plus Daniel Craig isn't bond-like at all. He has no class, hes just all about wrecking things. He isn't even British either."
29,annie-2014-movie,Sherron2048,10,I took my 7-year-old daughter to see this movie and we both LOVED it (especially the music). The songs were so catchy that I ended up buying the soundtrack so that we could keep enjoying it. I purchased the movie from the Google play store too. I am a huge fan of the original Annie and now this remake has a special place in my heart also. The casting was very well done. The best thing about this movie IMO is the songs. The plot is still the same classic tale as told in the original Annie.
30,enders-game-movie,DemonSoul,0,"So cheesy. The acting is like throw up. I could not stay interested. Fell asleep after 40 minutes. It might have gotten good after that. But for that first hour minutes the dialogue/ script, the acting, were of the lowest quality. People don't talk like that...at all. To me, good sci-fi is like Minority Report, Back to the Future, Alien &amp; Prometheus, Even Horizon, Safety Not Guaranteed, District 9, Empire Strikes Back, AI, even Tron Legacy. I know the book was legendary, so I'm pretty disappointed they squandered the brilliance of the source material. If you liked the movies I listed, we have similar taste...Avoid wasting your time with this non-entertaining movie."
31,behaving-badly-movie,kman5473,0,"I only made it halfway through this movie. That's ~45 minutes of my life I'll never get back. With such a well-known cast, and it is amazing to me that this movie is as bad as it is. This is not a movie that is ""so bad it's good."" It's not entertaining. It is just tedious to watch. Shame on all involved with this pile of fecal matter."
32,anchorman-the-legend-continues-movie,hangerbaby,2,"Arguably less funny than Hannibal, this might be the least funny movie ever produced by Judd Apatow. I really had my hopes up because the first movie was quite funny and is always a good re-watch and the cast consists of some very funny people. I don't know what happened to the writing team, but it appears that they were convinced that the low-hanging fruit of obvious racial stereotype jokes would achieve some laughter (surprisingly it did work on some people around me). Not that jokes that go after stereotypes can't be funny, these were just executed so poorly it played like a film directed by a 12 year old Call of Duty player. The new characters in this film were incredibly one-dimensional and added nothing to the story or the humor. Ron's child was so annoying that I strongly debated leaving the theater the very moment he was introduced. The rival anchorman Jack Lime was so bad at acting that his humor felt forced to work with this writing style.. I just don't really know what to say. It was all so bad. I am an easy laugh, too. This is the first movie I have ever seen where I would have left had I gone alone. No question."
33,the-jacket-movie,sloppyjoes,3,"Utter drivel. The characters were decent but the plot-line was boring, and it became increasingly difficult to watch. It's kind of thrown together in an unpredictable manner and that makes it hard to enjoy."
34,unsane-movie,AriaSalessi,8,"Unsane is a great example of a psychological thriller that comes to my mind. From beginning to end, the movie is interesting, and at times leaves the viewer dumbfounded which is the intention of a psychological thriller."
35,the-avengers-age-of-ultron-movie,Th3GreenHorne7,10,"Age of Ultron had reached for the stars with a very good film, most of the time I was on the edge of my seat almost all of the film. The story was a little bit of a brain teaser which was a little challenging at times, but it always found the path it need to be on so you could understand again. The film had brought all the original members of the cast from the first Avengers film, their performances were no different than they were in The Avengers. When Age of Ultron was trying to shoot for the stars, they were also trying to break the $1.5 Billion box office record set by The Avengers back in 2012, but they were short by only $200 Million, but for Marvel, the critics and me, it was very successful."
36,transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-movie,GeofferyW,0," wow it took two Transformers movies to get one scene where robots are talking to each other, and no humans are present. If you want to see a great Transformers film watch the cartoon movie. at least they gave a d@m about the licence & history."
37,meetthefockers-movie,annbd,3,"It was just bad. It was like writers have 1 night to write their homework and they have started pretty late. I remember it was so boring I could not wait the end. Maybe it's not that bad, but I have watch better comedies, that I could recommend - the good old Mrs. Doubtfire, The 40 Year Old Virgin, The House Bunny, The Hot Chick, 10 things I hate about you and many more."
38,walle-movie,NickF,10, Awesome movie. The graphics are fantastic. The love story between robots is a good idea. 
39,beowulf-movie,JarrodK,2," I had to see this movie as a requirement for an English Class, and I have to say that it is the worst movie that I have seen all year. The liberties the writers take with the script are just downright ridiculous and do nothing to improve the story. Angelina Jolie as Grendel's mother? Wow, that really stretches both the Epic of Beowulf and John Gardner's Grendel. This movie had so much potential, but really wasted the charm that the original story had and instead replaced it with animated sexual lust. A resounding 2 out of 10."
40,movie-43-movie,MovieGuys,1,"Despite an A List cast, Movie 43 is a tasteless exercise that feels like a 90 minute collection of rejected Saturday Night Live skits. It tries to intentionally parody itself, yet that fails, and the movie is really a bad parody of that parody. If that makes sense. Stay away. Don't waste your time. At least George Clooney had the common sense to reject a cameo, his response being ""No fking way"". Do what George did: reject this movie, completely."
41,coraline-movie,Makenzie,3,"“Coraline” is an Adventure, Fantasy, and Thriller movie. Henry Selick was the main producer and director of the movie. The studio that produced it was Focus. It is an animated adventure movie that has many cool effects but also flaws.The main character of this movie is Coraline (Dakota Fanning). Coraline is an adventurous person that likes to explore around her new home after moving to  Pink Palace Apartments. As Coraline is exploring outside she meets a boy named Wybie(Robert Bailey Jr).That gives her a doll that looks just like her. When she starts to explore the house she finds a secret door in the wall that leads her to a place that is as perfect as can be with the “other parents”. Coraline starts to go back every day. But, she starts to get warnings about a dark secret in the so called perfect world that puts Coraline and her family in danger.One of the good things about the movie are the effects.The way they could make the characters do certain things seemed like it took a lot of time to do. Also the concept of the story and how they executed it was pretty good. Another good thing about this movie was the animation. But, the movie was also very predictable and got a little boring as it went on. It’s likely they started to ran out of ideas on how to keep the movie going so it seemed as if they put in little time as the movie progressed.For this movie I would recommend it to people who like adventure, mystery or a thriller. For the age I would say around 8 or older due to scary jump scares and scary characters at the end of movie, inappropriate scenes like not enough clothing on a few of characters you might not want your kids to see. The MPAA rating is PG. Our overall thought of this movie was that is a pretty average."
42,teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movie,Movi3R3vi3wer,1,"Well I fears were realized, this movie sucks. They're barely any redeeming qualities to this piece of garbage! While this isn't as bad as Transformers Age of Extinction is, you can completely tell it's a Michael Bay production."
43,the-adventures-of-sharkboy-and-lavagirl-3-d-movie,BrandonJ.,8," For those of you who say kids hate it: If you haven't noticed, every single kid, and only the kids, have posted on here saying they love the movie; it's only older kids and parents that will be likely to hate this."
44,300-movie,GA,9, Almost too awesome! Go if you like having fun.
45,wadjda-movie,cesardpb10,9,"Wow, a movie made with heart for the heart.It's a very simple plot but extremely beautiful, the main character, Wadjda, stole your heart from the beginning.Definitely a movie that everybody should watch and feel.I love it."
46,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Antiks,3,"Overall I found it pretty boring. Lots of stories that were mostly pointless with only Rey and Kylo having anything worthwhile going on. Kylo was improved overall. The whole ship chase was incredibly dull. Cut out the Poe, Rose, and Finn stories and it would have been a better movie. Didn't see a reason to go killing the old guard off, was looking forward to seeing a re-energized Luke. R2 was there with Luke but used only for like 1 scene, there should have been a bit more emotion there but it fell pretty flat. Other than Rey and Kylo the new characters are not working for me at all.It also seems disney was really hoping those little bird things they made would do great as merchandise as they are everywhere(many on sale in stores), quite literally added to the film to be merchandise. Doing things like that seems pretty scummy to me."
47,pulp-fiction-movie,C.B.,10, I still remember how giddy and excited I was while I was watching this movie in the theater. A top ten favorite of mine.
48,backdraft-movie,PamL.,8," Saw this movie on VHS as a rental and liked it enough to buy it. I found it to be an interesting tale about brothers, teamwork, risk-taking, and trust."
49,once-movie,Johnny2cents,2, Surely I must have been on another planet and it all just went over my head. People were dazzled and touched by this movie?? I was frazzled and bamboozled. I banged my head against the wall to make sure I wasn't comatose.
50,ghostbusters-2016-movie,kuehnau,3,"Ghostbusters 2016 is a reboot of the classic franchise from the 80's. It re-imagines the Ghostbusters team as a  all female cast. For this review, I will be discussing the film itself and not the drama and controversy surround it. The movie opens up with hard hitting jokes such as anti-Irish fences, enslaving elephants and a fart joke about a EVP involving a female ""queef"". You can expect other such quality jokes about a man pooping his pants, a  joke in the disguise of one of the main characters being slimed, a coward of a man screaming like a eight year old girl and much more. There is a moment of blatant advertising for Pringles potato chips. They don't even attempt to hide it and are unapologetic about it. It's bad enough they expect people to pay money to see this film, but then they cram advertising down their throat. The complaint that the film portrays all men as jerks, creeps or idiots is doesn't appear to be a valid complaint. If anyone can recall the older movies in the franchise, the Ghostbusters have always had problems with authority and in almost all cases, it has always been men. With that being said, the male secretary for the reboot is beyond stupid, this character is so dumb they should be considered mentally retarded, it's to the point that it is literally offensive that anyone would consider this character funny. I assume the animated behavior and antics of the characters are intended to be funny, but failed on almost every level to as so much illicit a smirk from me. The funniest moment is when a person literally flips them off and tells them to ""suck it"" for a extend period. The character Patty just seems to be like a hodgepodge of black stereotypes in her mannerism and the way she speaks. The remade theme son of the Ghostbusters is absolutely terrible, they took a classic theme and turned it into a hip-hop, rap stylized song and it fails on several levels. The movie blatantly ignores source material, steaming ahead and forging it's own path. Perhaps if this movie was intended to be more of a spiritual successor instead of a direct reboot, it wouldn't be so heavily criticized, but the fact is, this movie was never intended for the fans of the classic franchise. None of the jokes or dialog match the thoughts and feelings of the original movie. This is a great example of meritocracy at it's best, dragging the since long dead corpse of the Ghostbuster's name through the mud and making a complete mockery of something many people have held near and dear. People who have never watched the originals may enjoy the film, but the reality is, Ghostbusters 2016 will in no way please the actual fans who have supported the Ghostbusters franchise for nearly three decades."
51,nine-movie,BillyS,7," First of all, i'm sorry but, Daniel Day Lewis is totally wrong for the lead in Nine, they should have stayed with Javier Bardem. Second, with a cast like Sophia Loren, Nicole Kidman, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, Marion Cottilard and Kate Hudson you'd think someone would step up and deliver an Oscar worthy performance, but it's Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie who steals the movie with her appointed number - ""Be Italian"". The whole movie plays like an assembly line of musical numbers where each actress gets their 15 minutes then on to the next. The production is visually stunning and should be nominated for alot of technical Oscars, but the movie just doesn't connect with the augience. A major disappointment consifering all involved."
52,noah-movie,Headcrusher,7,"This film was inspired by two different sources IMO - the Bible and the Lord of the Rings movies, put them together and you get something like this. Still, one of the ways I estimate a films effectiveness is by the way the audience responds - it was a talkative late night crowd but once the film got going, they were totally silent and riveted to the screen. When the film was over there was both uncomfortable laughter and applause. It definitely gave them something to think about and I bet a bunch of those people went home and cracked open their bibles to read the story, some maybe for the first time. By the way Noah was not a Christian - or a Jew - at that point in the biblical narrative God hadn't even given the law yet so there is no reason to think Noah is a Christian film in the first place. The actual biblical story is about 3 pages in the bible which if depicted word for word might have made it to 20 or 30 minutes, unless you had 90 minutes of feeding and cleaning the animals."
53,catwoman-movie,JagF.,9," Despite what some people say, I thought this movie had pretty decent action, and an ok story. H.B. is hot!"
54,idlewild-movie,BooK.,8," Blows ""Moulin Rouge"" & ""Chicago"" away just in terms of sheer excitement. Beautifully filmed, obscenely talented and just plain fun."
55,suicide-squad-movie,BaroqueGuide98,0,"There isn't nothing good, in this film. NOTHING. Harley Quinn is sexy, ok, but very, VERY, V E R Y  annoying character. The actors are good but the scenography is the worst I ever seen. The Suicide Squad aren't superheroes: they are 5 idiot without any type of objective. One of the most bad, annoying, boring,and you can't save    NOTHING in that film."
56,american-sniper-movie,cryhardhumor,8,"This movie isn't as much about the political views or beliefs about the war, but purely about the man. And I for one found it respectful, well shot, and insanely well acted. Unfortunately the scenes that take place back in the states are less emotionally powerful as they could be, and instead drag on for a bit longer than they needed to have."
57,manderlay-movie,JanisV.,9," Just like Dogville another thought-provoking, intelligent film by von Trier. Maybe not quite the masterpiece Dogville was but pretty close anyway. Howard is a revelation and has no problem filling Kidman's footsteps (can you say that, my english isn't very good). The one thing I didn't care about were Grace's sexual fantasis, I didn't really get what von Trier was trying to say there. But overall I thought this was one of the best movie of last year."
58,captain-america-the-first-avenger-movie,TheoS,2,"American propaganda is like so 60 years ago.  It's painful to watch this movie( cause I can't call it film).It's just too fact breaking.Everything about it is fake. Actors do as much as they can with such a poor script.Unfortunately this movie makes you understand the nazi. If you'd had a  with a shield trying to stop you, you'll do the same.."
59,a-clockwork-orange-movie,kylerawks,0,This movie deserves to burn in hell. I only watched one short scene to prove that this movie is a terrible piece of garbage. I hope that the characters in this movie get beaten to death. I hope people who actually like this movie change their mind and break the disc. This movie deserves nobody's time.
60,grown-ups-2-movie,Toffenuff,2,"I honestly actually liked the first Grown Ups movie. This one? Not so much. Worse than the previous film. Pretty much forcing bad jokes all throughout and is just plain dumb for a good chunk of it. A few good laughs here and there to be sure, but not worth seeing unless you have no other better options available."
61,ben-hur-movie,DavidV293,1,"I couldn't wait for this movie to be over, so I can  on it and give it my honest opinion. It starts off terrible and it ends horrible. The action was okay, but the ACTING. Holy crap, I wanted to yell and say this movie is  to the whole audience. Will you see this movie in Netflix? yes. Will the price drop when it comes on DVD/Blu ray? HELL YEAHH!."
62,the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-1-movie,TheApplegnome,7,"I’m not a big fan of Hunger Games, but the franchise keep surprise me. The first aspect I would like to mention is the rebellion. It’s so different from the previous installments, and I totally love it. The ”games” didn’t impress me as much as I would like to. So I really did enjoy this third Hunger Games movie. There’re even some metaphorical messages witch really gives the movie depth. The first act is okay, but not more. And the opening scene could have had a much greater contexture. I did expect a lot unique things that Catching Fire had, but there're not much of those. Many do criticize this movie because it doesn’t have much action, and I somewhat agree. The tempo is very slow, but I didn’t find it boring. On the contrary; I thought it was very entertaining. There are not much CGI and the movie overall felt very natural. But there are some events that are predictable, which is not good. The best thing with this movie is the second act, it’s very entertaining. But the third is a bit disappointing. The ending could have been much more exiting and eventful. I didn’t feel any excitement when the movie ended. Overall is this third Hunger Games movie great, even though the soundtrack could have been much more astounding and powerful. But the main cast are all very good and the movie did surpass my expectations. The focus of this movie is on insurrection, survival and hope. There's a big difference between this and the previous movie. The strong sides are the dialogs, plot and strong development of existing characters. But the big weakness is the lack of action. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 gets a 7/10."

68,the-counterfeiters-movie,DennisB.,8," Well-written, with realistic, nuanced performances helped by a story whose shadings of right and wrong hold your interest from beginning to end.

75,hidden-figures-movie,whitmorgan7,9,"I have only raves about this movie. I have waited a few days to write a review since I watched it mostly because I knew I would write a book if I didn’t. This movie touched me in so many ways, and it made me feel like I could touch the moon. Being a woman in the business world, even today there are struggles we face, I couldn’t imagine having been an African American woman in the 60’s trying to get to the top. From the cast to the movie itself, everything was stellar, and probably the best movie I will see all year.The story centers around Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson; three African American women working at NASA, all with dreams of their own. Katherine is an amazing mathematician, Dorothy has dreams of being a supervisor, and Mary wants to be an engineer. Individually, they face seemingly impossible stepping stones in order to get to where they want to be. One by one, they start to see their dreams unfold before their eyes, all while watching the world change around them.I found myself relating so much to Taraji P. Henson’s character so much. With my profound love for math, I know what it feels like to be a woman in a man’s world, the story touched me and made me have a different level of respect for this woman. Janelle Monae’s character Mary was a driven woman who would do whatever it took to reach her dream. She went before the court and had the most inspiring quote of the whole movie, which is the quote I used at the beginning of my review. We all know Octavia Simpson only plays characters who are as strong and beautiful as she is, her story touched me mostly because she never gave up, and she never let failure or a hard road dampen her dreams. These women are all someone I think we can aspire to be.The rest of the cast included Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Glen Powell, and so many more amazing actors. They all give stellar performances. The entire cast couldn’t have been chosen better. The film stuck to the original story and the facts very well, which I appreciated. It’s always good to enjoy a film, and learn a little bit about history as well. There’s just something about a movie that makes you feel good and knowing that it’s all true. It gives you hope that the world isn’t as bad as you think it is.I know I didn’t go too deep into the story with this one, but its all facts. You can read the book, you can look it up. Just know that this movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you feel good, and it will give you hope. It’s a movie you can take the whole family to. I promise you won’t regret seeing this, and even if you have to pat $15, its worth it. If for nothing else, the acting is the best you’ll see in a film all year."
76,310-to-yuma-movie,JimS,9," Very good, entertaining film. I was never a huge fan of westerns, but was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Well paced and acted, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good action drama."
77,heaven-is-for-real-movie,WJS,3,"I was raised a Christian although I no longer believe in it. To me this film is just an elaborate science fiction film masquerading as real life Christianity. It's well acted and beautifully shot, but really, it kind of prays on the beliefs of the majority of the world’s faithful. It's just not for me."
78,avatar-movie,JoeC,3," One small step forward for filmmaking technology, one giant leap backward for writing, acting, directing...oh you know."
79,the-tale-of-despereaux-movie,LeventeS.,2," A boring pseudo-legend with unconvincing characters, phoned-in voice acting, a completely unnecessary narrator, mediocre visuals, poor dialogue, a bad plot, and, despite the potential for comic brilliance, was completely unfunny after the first half hour, and would only be funny if you hadn't seen the trailer in which they threw away all the good jokes. This is strictly a kids' movie, and not a very good one, at that. Definitely not worth the first viewing, much less a second."
80,the-simpsons-movie-movie,XavierJ,8," The Simpsons Movie was a good movie but I didn't find some other things funny like ""spider pig"", thought that was just silly. But the film is worth seeing, especially after the first half."
81,steve-jobs-movie,MattBrady99,8,"So I've finally got a chance to watch ""Steve Jobs"" over the weekend and I thought it was pretty good. Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet both gave a terrific performance, as the chemistry between the two was convincing and enjoyable to watch. The writing and the directing is this movies biggest strength, because the movie is non-stop talking and that's what this movie really is, and I know this isn't going to be for everyone, but for me, I was engaged all the way through and I honestly can't recall being bored while watching the movie. My biggest praise that I have for this movie has to go to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin, because filming and writing a movie like this isn't easy (trust me). The problems I have for the movie are very small and many people wouldn't be bothered by this, but this is just me. The little kid actor in the movie (Who plays Steve Jobs young daughter) she wasn't bad, as I thought she did alright for the most part, but there were a few times when I noticed some slip ups. But that's just a mini problem and the rest of the performances from everyone was great. Overall Steve Jobs is a well made film with clever writing, outstanding acting and directing. It's a shame that this movie was pulled from many theaters because nobody wanted to see it. Jem and the Holograms and Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, both sht movies that managed to stay in cinemas, but this movie didn't."
82,gore-vidal-the-united-states-of-amnesia-movie,VinceM,9,"Wow, Gore Vital is unflappable in the face of the many disappointments and challenges in his life. His courage to speak out and question the status quo of the American lifestyle is cleverly portrayed throughout this movie.  Clearly he was a man of great insight, charm, writing still and influence so that few can compare. His criticisms of past US Presidents was both accurate and often hilarious. If you'd like to find out who this man was and his place in US History, this is the film to see. Cheers!"
83,wedding-crashers-movie,JeremyW.,10, Best comedy of the year (2005). Could not stop laughing. WOW. All in all a must.
84,inglourious-basterds-movie,chrisB.,3," The marketing and advertising for this movie is extremely deceiving and I'm pi$%ed off, and feel stupid for falling for it. Basterds was advertised as an ""action"" and ""war"" movie... it was niether one!! It was a diologue movie and the character development was so horrid that i didnt care what they were blabbering about for 2.5 hours. The saviors of the film were chris waltz and the german officer they broke out of prison (who they killed way to early)... Death-proof was so bad that i should have seen it coming. Tarantino tries to salute so many old movies, he just needs to focus on his own... its going to his head."

90,the-dark-knight-movie,jgcorbett00,10,"People will say this isn't a superhero movie it is a cop movie. That's not the point. This movie surpassed all doubts and expectations, with an incredible cast, a gripping story, edge of your seat suspense, and above all a great antagonist. Heath Ledger gave us a villain that scared and amazed at the same time with his unforgettable role as the Joker. It may not be a superhero movie to its core but this became more than that it became a work of art under Nolan's guiding hands. In my opinion this is one of the best movies of the 2000's. 10/10"
91,the-chronicles-of-narnia-prince-caspian-movie,ThomasB.,8," A fun movie, great for kids and parents alike."
92,i-am-legend-movie,LyndellK.,9," This movie with Will Smith's performance deserves a 10. The monsters some say were not scary well they were not supposed to be these horrible thing they were people infected by a virus the thought of these soulless shells of what used to be a human had me at the edge the entire time. Then how it showed this man who had lost everything at the edge releasing that all he has are himself and these In-Human creatures it was amazing. The movie go's from Thriller to Horror to Drama then has an ending that was unexpected and that Greatly Combined all of the genres that went from absolutely nothing anyone could possibly do, too an Amazing miracle happening That left me want to know so much more about the apocalyptic time. the only draw back is i prefer reaL people instead of GFX. great movie 9-10 and one of the best performances i've ever seen by an actor."
93,open-water-movie,RavenousGrue,2,How did this movie earn a Saturn Award? The acting was awful. Never did the actors manage to convey the feelings that any normal people would feel in this terrifying situation.
94,the-da-vinci-code-movie,HannahB.,10," I actually really liked this movie better than I expected, it's always hard to adapt a book into a movie and I think they did a fine job. Casting was pretty much good and Tom Hanks is fine as Robert Langdon. Given the fact that in the book we don't know much about Langdon's personality anyway so I think Tom Hanks was fine as usual. Audrey Tautou was good especially for an English speaking role which is not her native language. Paul Bettany, which I never heard of I actually thought he was French until I looked him up! Ian McKellen is always great, and just how Teabing should be. Jean Reno was fine and convincing. And Alfred Molina was okay for the Bishop although that role could have easily been dropped. The backgrounds and sets are amazing and spot on and the story is just how the book is. What gets me is that some people didn't enjoy the story but that should not be an issue because the movie should follow the story or else it wouldn't be a book adaptation! So people who didn't like the story I think shouldn't be reviewing this movie at all or else it would just be a contradiction! Great movie, Critics too harsh (as usual), not offensive because it's fiction remember. If it's not too late go and see it you shouldn't regret it and if you didn't like it come and complain to me!"
95,superbad-movie,AMovieCritic,7," Really funny movie, deliciously raunchy R-rated comedy. Produced by Judd Apatow, the guy who directed Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin, (whose quickly becomming our generation's Harold Ramis,) this movie targets high school and college-aged people almost exclusively, but people in those age brackets will have a great time watching this movie. Unfortunately, the movie falls into the same trap as some recent comedies, in which the first 30 minutes or so is so funny that our expectations for the movie are raised so highly that the rest of it simply can't meet them. Still, though, it's an EXTREMELY funny movie, even though it loses steam after an excellent first half hour. Pretty funny comedy, with a smart and surprisingly sweet ending."
96,king-kong-movie,RaulJ.,8," Old fashioned blockbuster entertainment. Yes, it may be a bit over-done in certain ways, but this does not hurt the movie. I do sypathize with those who say there are too many effects and too little heart. I would revise that to say over the top effects and marginal character development. Overall, very good entertainment."
97,noah-movie,Youmustdienow,8,"The movie to my understanding is the film maker's interoperation of the story of Noah's Arch. From watching the trailer I didn't expect to see so much cgi creatures. Some will say this stuff is sci fi, but I think it follows the Bible as intended by explaining story metaphorically. It was done very artistically. Some effects looked like they were stop motion. As a movie it entertained. The casting was remarkable. The last Bible movie this good was The Passion of the Christ. Dark and griity Bible movies with great acting and descent production values is the way to go."
98,overlord-re-release-movie,JonathanM.,10," Superb war movie. The use of original film (and stuck from the old nitrate stock) is wonderful. How can such a classic only now come to light? (Well, remember Melville and ""Billy Budd."")"
99,captain-phillips-movie,shpostal,10,"Finally, a truly great movie with perhaps ""The Prisoner"" the only other drama worth seeing in a year of stunning failures.    ""Captain Phillips"" is brilliant, and based on a true story I remember from 2009.    Of course, Tom Hanks is the catalyst here, and once again shows the movie world why he is the greatest living actor today, although Joseph Gordon-Levitt will be a major force to reckon with  if he isn't already, and the great Jennifer Lawrence, probably the best actress out there, will be out in the ""Hunger Games"" sequel ""Catching Fire"" and a new movie with Bradley Cooper later.The key to Hanks' greatness is his believability.    Regardless of his role, he can assimilate anything, making us really think he is what his role says he is.    Nobody could possibly have pulled off ""Forrest Gump"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" except him.    Now, as a captain of a cargo vessel bound from Oman to Somalia, his ship is taken over by a bunch of unbelievably scraggly pirates, who all deserve praise for their authentic portrayals as well.I must ask  is the lead pirate called ""Mule"" an authentic Somalian who Hollywood rescued for this role?    If not, it's shocking how well they did making him especially gruesome and emaciated, almost making the viewer understand how starvation and the brutal regimes controlling that part of the world force people into desperate situations.Without giving up the plot, which is predictable because it was a well covered news story, we see the workings of a cargo ship, the Navy SEALS and the plight of Phillips with alarming accuracy and not a shred of doubt.It is my favorite movie of the year, and perhaps the most moving part is at the end of the film, with Phillips safely in sick bay, and suffering the hysteria of the ordeal as a Navy Corpswoman looks him over.    No silly ass tough guy theatrics here  his reaction is just what normal people would do, not make lame jokes like a Mark Wahlberg film.    In that briefest of times, Hanks puts himself in the top running for an Oscar, and makes you almost cry.    All hail Tom Hanks and the crew who put this masterpiece together."
100,the-worlds-end-movie,davehesmo,3,"A film with such high ratings from critics and users, but so utterly poor beyond the first 20 minutes, that I had to sign up to Metacritic to ensure that sane people's views were represented more fully. Pegg and Frost have truly lost their way. How deeply disillusioning to see the wonderful Paddy Considine and Martin Freeman in a film so lacking in wit, skill, grace and genuine thoughfulness. Nice idea: zombie slave metaphor for middle age conformity. And the odd good line early on. But the people making it have so lost touch with ordinary life that they no longer know how to turn life into art, or more to the point, comedy. No one, but no one, will remember this film with affection in ten years' time."
101,grand-piano-movie,Royphish,2,"A truly terrible film with a ludicrous plot and dreadful acting, most notably from John Cusack who delivers the weakest performance of his career. The script is wooden and the direction is dire."
102,batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-movie,ClarkB,10,"Thank You Foolish Critics!!!... ...Because of so many of you and your horrible reviews I went into BvS with extremely low expectations. Instead, I was pleasantly rewarded with quite possibly the best Superhero movie I've seen and perhaps one of my favorite movies...period! As some of you reading this may have already noticed, BvS has not received rave reviews. Matter of fact, most of the so-called critics are trashing this movie; however, after the movie was finished, myself and everyone sitting around me were left asking: ""Why?"" We were all freaking out and pumped from the DC Trinity extravaganza we all just witnessed. BvS was a glorious experience that had not only myself, but everyone (I noticed) around me completely enthralled and joyously entertained! I was giddy as a schoolgirl with excitement, particularly because this Superman fanboy not only loved me some Man of Steel, but was absolutely floored by the Batfleck...like that bad guy that was face-planted by Bats in the movie...you know the one. Yes, Mr. Affleck's masterpiece portrayal of the Dark Knight is by far the best Batman ever!...sorry Mr. Bale, but it ain't even close. This is The Batman I loved from the comics! This is The Batman I loved from Batman: The Animated Series! This is the Batman that is the genius tactician that you could believe is finally capable of living up to the moniker of World's Greatest Detective! In addition, Wonder Woman kicks some serious ass and her appearance definitely received the biggest applause of the movie. I could go into more detail about what makes this movie great for me, I could go on and on and give you an overly analytical rant as to why I feel the way I do about this film, but let's face it, who am I to suggest what you may like?...which is the same reason why you shouldn't put to much weight in the critics' reviews either. Is the movie perfect in every way? Perhaps not. The best advice I can give in regards to BvS, is that if you are not already a fan of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, DC Comics or the superhero genre, you may not like the film (or perhaps become a fan yourself). However, if you are already a fan of those things I mentioned, then the movie is definitely worth the price of admission! And furthermore, even though I had already seen all of the trailers, I was still given enough to chew on in this film to feel like I hadn't already seen it all. Go see this movie with an open mind and if your experience is anything like mine, you'll HAVE A BLAST! BvS is everything an action blockbuster of this type should be: being thoroughly entertained to the point where you and complete strangers around you in the theater can't help but cheer and celebrate together at what you just saw on screen! I know I'll be going to see it a couple more times before it leaves the theater!"
103,live-free-or-die-hard-movie,ChrisE,7,"Great buddy flick, some of the action is so out there, they wouldn't put it in a video game (HA!) Bruce is Bruce, having a good ol' time...it's a little too long and some of the witty banter needed a few of those punches that McClain was giving out with gusto but I really couldn't complain about that, but it does bring up two of the major issues that I had with this flick. ...not a good movie to show examples on how to treat a lady...there were three women that got more than a minute of screen time and two of them get smack around by men (im sorry...did I mention how McClain jacked the ""Asian"" chick up?) and the one lady who didn't get beat down was nothing more than a diversity backdrop...she was in the room with the big boys but was nothing more than a live prop. Susan B. Anthony would be so proud. the other thing? that was the most questionable PG-13 I've seen in a while...."
104,deadpool-2-movie,Kenmei,8,"By design, this movie is essentially what the first one could have been with a much higher budget. DP 2 hits on literally the same notes as the first movie and there's a good amount of 4th wall breaking action to go with a few rehashed jokes from the original. It's still absolutely hilarious to watch and Ryan Reynolds is definitely not afraid to make fun of himself at any moment to garner a laugh or two. I just wish that the one thing the movie wasn't afraid of was making fun of it's super dull, and super boring main plot that barely acts as a way to keep the laughs going. It was the same with the first movie. The writers are clearly not afraid to poke fun at anything, unless that happens to carry anything forward with the plot. It's such an easy setup too since both movies now have been almost the definition of a stereotypical hero growth formula we've seen from hundreds of other movies at this point. Still I'll give them credit for pushing the envelope yet again here with some of the humor subject matter and it makes me wonder what they'll do for future movies since Marvel will prob own the X-Men franchise before a 3rd one can come out."
105,existenz-movie,Spangle,8,"eXistenZ is an incredibly weird film that is pretty hard to explain, but I still loved it. It has to be one of the weirder concepts I have seen put to film, but director David Cronenberg does a great job keeping track of it all as things get weirder and weirder. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law's performances are very good here and, though some would call them wooden, it is purposeful here, so they did a good job capturing that. Additionally, the film really messes with your mind and makes you question reality incredibly well. What is real and what is not real is really hard to put together and it is thanks to Cronenberg's assured direction that the film is not a mess. eXistenZ is an oddball of a film that is an incredibly good time and really makes you think. Ignore the rating on Metacritic. Something is odd, considering none of the negative ratings have an accompanying review."
106,disturbia-movie,spadenx,7,It is predictable but solid acting and the film's ability to hold interest through out more then make up for it. I liked the film and I am suprised that so many people bash it.
107,children-of-men-movie,Aly,1," This movie is the 2nd worst movie I've seen in my life. I was completely upset that a good somewhat original film idea was screwed up so badly. As others have said there is no character development (the ""love"" between Julianne Moore and Clive Owen is nonexistent) and the plot is FULL of holes. I feel this movie was somehow rushed in its making and they just kind of threw it together hoping there might be some good parts. I can't believe that this was given such high reviews and I wait for the next movie with a similar idea that might be done right."
108,iron-man-3-movie,DarkWolf1991,7,Great acting and action scenes but wasn't as good as the trailers made it out to be. It was a over-hyped film but that doesn't mean it was a bad film.
109,ghostbusters-2016-movie,Danivus,0,"Truly one of the worst films ever made. This utter insult of a soft reboot to a beloved franchise can't even be considered a cash grab. Ignoring the weird sexist tones where every man is either incompetent, evil or often times both, this film is rarely funny and fails to pace itself properly. Compare it to the original Ghostbusters, where the climax battle is followed by a short shot of everyone celebrating before the credit rolls. This movie does the same thing... except after it just goes on for several more minutes with two more pointless scenes."
110,where-the-wild-things-are-movie,SolidWeaselMGS,1,"Now, yes. Many people.. are going to disagree with me, go ahead, hate me. I don't like this movie. I DESPISE THIS MOVIE!!! This is just too dark, too dark (by this part, I mean literally, JUST LOOK AT THE BACKGROUND PEOPLE!!!), and what is pretty much one of the worst costumes on a person for a kids movie, this movie is unappealing and is too dark for a children's movie. And I wanted to give it a chance, because when I was a little kid (or even a baby), this was one one of my favourite books, and you people are giving me this, how disgraceful."
111,selma-movie,adpirtle,9,"Efficiently and unflinchingly directed by Ava DuVernay, ""Selma"" retells one of the Civil Rights Movement's most pivotal moments without glossing over the conflicts within the movement or the brutality pitted against it. British actor David Oyelowo delivers a powerful performance as Martin Luther King, Jr., one that should have certainly netted him an Oscar nod, regardless of the packed field, but he doesn't have to carry this film. Fellow Brit Tom Wilkinson does a great job with his role as a politically harried Lyndon Johnson, torn between personal empathy and political expedience. There has been some handwringing over the accuracy of the film's portrayal of LBJ's relationship with MLK, but I found the film to be more historically accurate than the claims of some of the late president's defenders. Carmen Ejogo wonderfully reprises the role of Coretta Scott King, which she first took up with the late activist's blessing in 2001's TV movie, ""Boycott."" Other big names pepper the cast (Oprah Winfrey, Tim Roth, Martin Sheen, Cuba Gooding, Jr.), but it's these three performances which are most memorable."
112,the-day-the-earth-stood-still-movie,JayM.,2," Exemplifies all that is wrong with Hollywood films: an unnecessary remake, an overwrought script, and a director too enamored with special effects for their own sake. Utterly lacking in every department. Charmless."
113,the-roommate-movie,morgul,0,"I was sorely tempted to ask for a refund of my ticket purchase after sitting through this abomination. My reason for asking would be to point out to the theater management that I had already seen Single White Female several years ago and I paid for a ticket then. Single White Female was much better done in all respects. In addition, Minka Kelly looks as much like a college freshman as I do, and I graduated college more than 30 years ago."

115,need-for-speed-movie,IMAX500,9,"At first I thought the movie is going to be terrible because critics didn't like it. But For Now, I like it. Car Races and Crashes, Really Amazing. Sound Mixing, Terrific. The Part where the guy was naked. Really Funny and a little bit Disturbing because it shows the guy's bottom. But Still, Terrific Movie Based on a Video Game."

117,tucker-dale-vs-evil-movie,Tokyochuchu,7,"Tucker &amp; Dale vs Evil is a very funny goofball comedy with a healthy splattering of gore. It nails it's movie references well and there's a knowing nod around every corner. It's even quite original in it's own way; I can't think of another movie with the same concept. But most importantly of all, the movie delivers a lot of gut-rumbling laughs. It ain't rocket science but it certainly does the job it sets out to do."
118,the-twilight-saga-new-moon-movie,Hasriona,0,"The sequel to one of the worst films ever made takes the crown of being the actual worst film ever made.

120,the-dark-knight-movie,RienyeN,10, This movie is awesome! I've always thought Ledger is always overact but he pulled off a beautiful performance. He is everything the joker is meant to be be. Bale still did a good job although Gyllenhaal was a let down. For those who claim that the movie is depressing then they just didn't get it. Batman isn't about being a hero who saves the day and the whole ciity is thankful. He's both loved and hated. Kudos to Nolan for as showing us the real dark knight. This movie makes it so much easier to forget those dreadful days of Batman &amp; Robin and Mr Freeze!!!
121,v-for-vendetta-movie,deedee,7,"Likable movie. The story was unique and at some points touching. I loved the twists and the games V planned for everyone. It was like he was the master of puppets :) And also, actors did their job very well."
122,extract-movie,dev92,7,"I really enjoyed this film, it was rather similar to Office Space in terms of style and a little of the story. I thought that Ben Affleck was very good in his supporting role whilst Bateman did his best with the lead. It is definitely worth a watch."
123,the-purge-the-island-movie,Proteus,3,Purge. So get to it. Literally 1/2 an hour before anything happens. Advice: deliver on the title when you make a movie. Skyscraper - tall building. A Quiet Place - minimal sound. Isle of Dogs - Dogs on an Island. And Purge - Purge.
124,jobs-movie,sammietee,3,"All I learned from this interpretation was that Steve Jobs as absolutely brilliant but hated shoes and could really be a huge jerk  If you aren't interested in computers then this movie is very dry and lacks entertainment. All I could think about while watching the movie was that I forgot my iPod at my parents house It really did nothing for me. I can see a demographic of people really enjoying this movie, I certainly wasn't one of them."
125,pirates-of-the-caribbean-at-worlds-end-movie,CarlH.,2, A huge disappointment.Instead of continuing with the concept they had they tried to add even more which only led to a huge mess that smells over the top in every single scene.The after the texts ending is totally out of place in such a movie.
126,earth-movie,AlexR,0," This movie sucked balls. all they did was just take the footage from Planet Earth (BBC Series) and say they filmed it. Disney is such a butthole. ""What's all this I hear about not wearing the Purity rings, ha ha"" - Mr. Mouse."
127,the-polar-express-movie,Whatwasthat?,1," Bad, Bad, Bad! I agree with those that say, don't take kids. It was mean, ugly and hearltless, with a sicko message that hope is found in believing that a made up person will give you the material objects that your family can't. I agree with Nancy. The cruel joke that the movie plays on the poor boy who is finally learning that his life is not a fairy tale and that he is poor and that that is OK as long as he accepts it. But no! the movie says he is wrong to be realistic and sensible. He should ""believe"" more in a lie that will stunt his emotional growth for a few more years and make him resent his poor family for not giving him big presents. So santa is ""god"" and material objects are the reason christmas exists. This movie insults all religions and spiritual orientations equally. But it is not just the message of greed and delusion that makes it bad, it is that it is randon and mean-spirited. Like so many readers noted, there was no story. The boy gets on, the train goes north, random unrelated things happen that make no sense and do not make you care at all about the people and then the train gets there, the boy gets a present, and then he comes home. So what happens next christmas? Does he go again? Does santa have to give him a bigger gift or he will think he got dissed? What if the boy went to meet Marilyn Manson and got a gift, would we all want him to ""believe"" in MM for the rest of his life. So when a kid loses his ""believe"" in the idea that he gets free things from a fictional character, we should all be sad for that person? Good christmas movies are about human values and choices and recognizing what is important. This movie was a creapy effort to sell a sick and harmful message."
128,transformers-the-last-knight-movie,temptershell,3,"It's hard to write about the next part of this series as a film because it looks like a super-slicked one with a great slide show that has no plot. It is not known if any scene was shot on an adequate shooting schedule because it seems to me that all the actors were on a green screen all the time. Except for the effects and tiring noise of the explosions, I did not notice anything else, and it was a shame because the first 3 parts I really liked."
129,the-time-travelers-wife-movie,JohnE.,0," I enjoy good movies weather they are chick flicks or horror films. Since this was based upon a book I came in with high hopes, but sadly enough this film made absolutely no sense at all. It was purposefully manipulative to your emotions, and had nothing to really bight your teeth into. This film made me very angry, why would anyone make this movie it sucks. In the sea of good romantic movies out there this one is a rock at the bottom of the Marianas trench."
130,the-curious-case-of-benjamin-button-movie,KevanM.,3, Everything was exquisite except for the story. Very boring!!
131,les-miserables-movie,Corvin,0,"By far the funniest musical I've ever seen.  Never mind that it isn't supposed to be funny.  If you read this review and then go see Les Miserables anyway, you better know how to entertain yourself.  I laughed my way through the final two hours by making up Weird Al style verses to substitute for the piteous wailing and moaning and brow beating and self-flagellation that makes up the actual verses.  Even my 66 year-old mother was making wisecracks by the end of it.  Her final verdict was the movie needed less singing and more fighting.  Sadly Les Miserables also lacks a guillotine, so you will have to hear the entire cast of characters go on and on in sobbing song until you long for a short, unmusical death scene.  Preferably a scene involving the entire cast."

133,your-name-movie,Loaf_,10,"Damn, now this video hit at least 40 mil, I'm so glad this movie got recognized for its fame, and for it being the movie to beat Spirited Away. I did watch that movie as well, mainly for its music and for the scenes and ending. Now, for Kimi No Nawa, it illustrates how we feel on certain things in life, how will never see that person, or wanting to see that person. That really goes on saying that these certain movies can touch on our hearts, but no one can really see this. Cause most people in the world don't have our tastes, some do, but not at this extent. But mostly, Your Name goes on to keep us watching over and over, and to appreciate it's style of writing and pleasure. Even though Makoto Shinkai couldn't handle the praise of his own movie, he has to understand that we relate to this kind of situation, and some of use knows how we feel when we knew somebody, but never got to talk or see to that person again. Shinkai really shows everything in his mind on what he imagines. I want to do that myself when I get into that kind of work for my story, but when making a story/storyline, you have to Brainstorm for hours on end on what goes here and there, and having to lay out characters for certain events. Shinkai did great, he warmed my heart from this movie, and gave me chills, especially with the colorful and vibrant environments in this film, I wish he realized his achievement, and stopped doubting himself, why don't people just accept the fact they've achieved something great or accept the fact they have to do this or that, and put everything you have into it, you don't have to give up on something hard or not worth doing,. But the point is that this film is gorgeous, and my hands hurts from typing so much, 10/10, love it forever!"
134,cowboys-aliens-movie,Mewtwo465,9,"This is also from my Rotten Tomatoes review:Well this film was quite a good one. The acting was good, the story was decent and the aliens were quite scary and gruesome. So does it all add up well in the end? Well in my opinion it does and as a result it turns out to be a good watch. It isn't as good as the classic Iron Man is but it's still a very good film. Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford and even Olivia Wilde are very good in this movie. This is the best role and acting Olivia Wilde has done in my opinion. Heck even the kid from The Last Airbender was quite good in this which is a huge step forward for him. I hope he gets inroled in better films in the future. Another good thing is that the aliens weren't C.G.I. for 100% of the time even though they were C.G.I. for most of it. So they actually put some effort into everything in this film and in my opinion it is way better than the critics and most of the audience put it. But the only problem I had with this film was that it could have been a little bit longer. But that's not a problem since most of the time you're having good fun. So I'm giving this film a 9/10 for being a good science fiction movie but being a litte bit short as well."
135,the-book-of-eli-movie,oblique15,9,"I love this movie, and the Main character.The Shades he wears fit him, cause hes mysterious, and makes everybody wonder what hes about, and capable of.

136,twisted-movie,EfeB.,0," I think since they are making films like this...metacritic fellas need to create a ""below zero"" rating system that enables us the mighty online critics to be able to score points like ""-8"". because frankly...i think i am putting the big fat red zero to shame by associating it with this. i am gona kill this movie...you wanna read it and have a good time?...here we go, number one: the name of the film is twisted, but for something to be ""twisted"" it needs to be straight first...thats not this movie. number two: make sure you bring a friend with you when you see this film, because you will need a witness to remind you that you were NOT infact in hell, but rather in your home watching a dvd. nunmber treeee: if you want to be a filmmaker or just join the film industry, this film is sure to make you wanna be a plumber, you will think that cleaning peoples toilets is a more rewarding line of work. number four: make sure you are not eating while watching this film, because whatever you eat, will reappear smack on your plate in the manner of vomit. number five: your t.v might reek of rotten flesh for weeks and attract near by rodents because this film STINKS. number six: while watching this movie, you will question your sanity and you may rise to a conclusion that you are insane, pick up an axe and swing it left and right, damaging furniture or other civilians. number seven: if you make it through the 50 minutes of this film, you will have an urge to receive a medal of courage of somesort, you will stand up, right hand on salute and just wait there for hours for nothing. number whatever: you will write a long and low rating rant at metacritic, and beg hollywod to not kick you in the bottom once again.

139,twelve-years-a-slave-movie,maliciouspuppet,1,"For such charged subject matter, this film is a snooze.  The script is laughably eloquent and unbelievable, the direction is plodding and slow paced, the acting (with the exception of Lupita Nyongo as Patsey) is adequate at best.  The movie needs about 30 minutes edited out of it to be watchable, for that matter the editing itself is unskilled and sophomoric.  Don't even get me started on the overblown soundtrack.  This film shouldn't even be nominated for a best film or best actor or best director Oscar.  But it will be, because everyone would be afraid not to vote for it since it deals with slavery and just like the Holocaust  a film about this subject will be revered whether it's good or not.  I think Steve McQueen might very well be the most overrated director today.  Boooooring!"
140,enchanted-movie,charlie,0, Terrible. Even for a children's movie.
141,flight-of-the-red-balloon-movie,DanB,2," In a word, Dull. Two hours of watching a frazzled mother, a quiet child and his equally quiet nanny go through their day to day. The most dramatic part of the film is when a tenant who is on screen for all of five minutes is to be evicted. A film for film students, and only them, with it's cracking of the fourth wall and subtle meta commentary. Supposedly the film is also about the dreams and thoughts of the three main characters, but they are never said aloud, or narrated, or even hinted at. If this film we're viewed by the deaf, they would miss nothing."
142,movie-43-movie,Longo12,1,I am so suprised by how a movie with so many of my favorite actors could be so bad. I went into it knowing all the bad reviews and everyone hating it and it was still below my expectations! The only skit i liked in the entire movie was the Emma Stone and Kieran Culkin bit. The superhero one also had its moments but still not good.
143,pirates-of-the-caribbean-at-worlds-end-movie,MattS.,1," If you're at least 12 years old, you have no excuse to like this movie. Laughable dialogue, a jumbled plot, no emotional connections with the characters. A three hour bore, easily the worst movie I've seen all year."

First to try to guess how much time there was left before it might become interesting, and secondly in order to simply judge how much longer I  had to endure it.  I don't get why the critics like it.....weak plot, weak dialog, and boring.  Jennifer Lawrence and Elizabeth Rohmer were the two bright spots.  I hope Christian Bale was well paid because otherwise I'd be very depressed about putting on 40 pounds for this epic miss if I were him."
152,king-kong-movie,David,3, Went to a Midnight showing and I think I was out before I had to go to work in the morning. I could have showed up an hour late and probably enjoyed the movie more after all the trailers and 45 minutes of nothing going on! Good action after we actually see Kong.. but by the end I was wishing she would push him off the building herself... so I could go home!
153,rambo-movie,RyanL.,10, This is an amazing film and to say its to violent just isn't true because this stuff is actually happening in Burma so overall Stallone puts on an amazing performance.
154,enders-game-movie,lmb,3,"Honestly, I can't help but feel like this review is a little biased, but after a great deal of thought I realized that it is, and that is why this movie was doomed to fail from the start. Ender's Game is one of the deepest, most thought provoking books there is, and is a must have for every bookshelf. The problem with an idolized masterpiece such as Ender's Game is that any attempts to re-create it as a motion picture will certainly be compared to the book. As most of us know by now, turning a book into a movie is no easy feat. You have to pick and choose what parts should be in the movie, who should portray the characters, and how to interpret the more abstract parts of the book. Ender's Game is about a boy who's spirit is crushed and who's childhood is extinguished for the good of mankind. The story contains numerous moral dilemmas, most of which don't have an easy answer. All in all, as a movie, Ender's Game was fine. It wasn't great, but it had it's moments and if you haven't read the book then I would advise you to go see it. However, as an avid fan of the book and all it's sequels, I feel like the movie fell victim to the inevitable outcome of not living up to the book's standards. Re-inventing the book as a movie has dented the god-like status that Ender's Game holds, and I feel like they shouldn't have tried in the first place."

Deadpool isn't a hero, he's just a guy who does whatever the hell he wants. Again you can't rate this movie with plot or character development cause again, when you read or watch Deadpool you except gags, violence, and breaking the 4th wall...(or 16 walls, for those who watched). When you watch this movie, its heavy violence, cursing, and nudity. Don't bring kids. Seriously, don't. It's Deadpool, not Spiderman."

I prefer Black Hawk Down: Alien Jellyfish Invasion as the title."

161,grumpy-old-men-movie,Compi24,8,"""Grumpy Old Men"" is a 1993 Donald Petrie film about two feuding old men (Lemmon, Matthau) who step up their game to woo their new neighbor (Ann-Margret). Let me start off by saying that I love both Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon and I have heard of how the two of them are often paired together on film. This is the first film I've seen with the both of them in it and I can tell why they were paired together here. The chemistry between Matthau and Lemmon is really noticeable throughout this film - they really love working with each other. Everyone else's performances were also very well done. The movie was also pretty funny overall, but what surprised me the most was that this film featured some very touching and heartwarming scenes within it. Honestly, I can say that this movie surprised me all together. I thought I was only going to get a 90 minute film of two old men swearing at each other. What I got was that, but with very great acting, subplot development, tonal diversity, and more. ""Grumpy Old Men"" is a film that I watched with a genuine smile on my face."

I could not bring myself to watch the movie past the 15 minute mark. It looks like the producers made their initial investment back and came few bucks on top thanks to Brad and that's all that matters, I guess. I am sure there are some idiots out there who will give it a four or five stars and call it an ""art"", but believe me there is NOTHING artistic about this piece of crap. Poor acting and vulgar opening scene does not qualify as art. I understand there is a scene with Cameron Diaz rubbing her kooch against the Ferrari !? This is why you gave it four or five stars, you moron(s) ? Go rent a porn ! I, also, read that director's brother jumped of the bridge. Now I know why."

I mean the whole night long the house has gun shot after gun shot coming from it but the cops only show up when the alarm goes off, I mean I know Detroit is bad but cops responding to gunshots still happens it just takes an hour or 2. that plot hole is one of MANY, more include bringing a gun because you are afraid of a blind guy, sleep gas not doing a damn thing, that fall not breaking a single bone in that girls body same goes for the nerd and his fall tho he did seem he might have a broken rib or something, dude randomly knows which way to go in a pitch black basement, the basement hatch has cracks in it why couldn't they see that someone was clearly standing right in front of it, did old man even have time to get to the hatch from where we last saw him why did they not hear him walk above them across the house why would he just assume that's where they went leaving every possible other exit free for the taking while following them down would keep all the other ways free and still secure that one, the amount of luck that blind man has is absurd, that or he has echolocation like he is daredevil or something...

This movie is pure comedy (in the best way possible) I love the way it put all together, comedy, ACTION, history, EASTER EGGS, this movie was the true entry for Civil War. Not to mention the performances (perfect cast), Paul Rud was just amazing for the role, Evangeline, lovely, Douglas did an excellent work. Ant-Man made me feel like if I were in the Marvel Universe.

173,the-gangster-squad-movie,MathewManson,9,I didn't know what to expect when I considered seeing this film--I was worried that there would be too much action and try to be something that it shouldn't. Gangster Squad is a heavily cliched film which does almost everything right. Are cliches all that bad? I don't think they are. A good introduction to all of the characters is key for this kind of film. The antagonist played by Sean Penn blew my mind and made me enjoy every moment he was on screen. Only problem I noticed with the introduction is that it drags on for longer than it needed to do so--taking up too much of a film which could have been longer. The mind-set needed to watch this film is that of what the classic gangster films used to be like. It's a classically designed and cliche gangster film which blew me away and only just misses out on the perfect score due to length.
174,ted-movie,SEROJ,0,"American comedies are going to very wrong destination! This movie is probably the worst i've ever seen! Dumb,vulgar,annoying,stupid and boring! I don't want to comment it,because just thinkng about ""TED"" makes me sick and angry! 0/10 is the highest score this movie deserves without no doubt!"
175,alien-resurrection-movie,zapV,7,"While not reaching the high bar, set by first Alien movies, “Resurrection” still is an interesting and entertaining film that develops themes introduced in the franchise."
176,changeling-movie,DirtyCash,1,"Where to start? Jolie was miscast, but maybe they wanted to make an action flick when the project started, had her sign up, and by mistake started working of a script for a totally different movie. It might explain the title. Or what about the irritating self awareness of John Malkovich who'd you, at any point in the movie, expect to break the rule of the 'fourth wall', look smugly into a camera and tell the audience that he's really pleased with his performance so far. Story wise: horrible, unbelievable plot turns, starting right of the bat when a seemingly intelligent woman is given the wrong boy back, her supposed son, who disappeared a few months earlier. The boy is not her son, she takes him home anyway...Â¤Â¤ Really? Â¤Â¤ The story continuous with Jolie trying to explain to the world that the boy is an impostor who doesn't even match her son's height to which a dentist and a school teacher are willing to testify. Why family members, neighbors, school chums, the family physician, the baby sitter and E.T. the Extraterrestrial weren't asked to help resolve the obvious misconception on the part of the police, was conveniently left out of the tale completely. No, in stead of taking the boy into custody and resuming the search for the real son, the police keep pushing her into believing it actually is her son after which the woman finds herself in a poorly copied tale by Kafka. From this point on the movie reveals itself for what it was intended to be. An endless string of manipulative scenes drenched in an Oscar vinaigrette in both the melodramatic writing and the obnoxiously polished cinematography with a fetish-like attention to props. Some movies get Oscar nods, but this one actually nods back."
177,appaloosa-movie,JaquieM,2," Renee, although sometimes a good actress, droned on and on in a wimpy, whiny way that was obnoxious - and she looked AWFUL. While I beleive they may have uglied-her down a little, teh result was just terrible. Not an awful moviem but not what I expected. Viggo (who I normally love) didn't look all thet great either and seemed to be there merely to collect a check. In fact, after about thirty minutes of it, that's what I wanted to say: ""Check please ... I'm outta here. Yup."""
178,can-a-song-save-your-life-movie,acquiredtastes2,10,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and it really wasn't a 'rom-com' as much as a 'light' drama. I was delighted by the performances of all the principals and found the movie as a whole rather charming andtotally unique. It was in no way predictable as I thought that certain characters were going to end up together. Refreshingly, in some respects, they didn't, although the potential was there in several scenes. The music to the film was probably the most engaging set of songs that I have heard in years. Did Keira do her own singing? Loved hearing Stevie Wonder's 'For Once in My Life' again, so appropriately done. The envisioning of musical accompaniement to Keira's first solo song was almost magical. Strangely, Adam Levine of Maroon 5 acquitted himself exceptionally well as I was prepared to dislike him for all the media hype. I found his acting performance commendable. The scenes of playing and living in NYC made me want to go back to the city as it was so attractively and engagingly displayed. All in all, I really liked this film."
179,kill-bill-vol-2-movie,ozcode,9,"I recently just watched both movies for the first time i have to by it self this movie is not much to talk about, but seeing vol.2 the movie was extremely better as a whole. This one by itself was really good and i really liked the ending of it all. I recommend especially anyone who is a fan of the old kung fu movies"
180,mad-max-fury-road-movie,BigZ,3,"This film fooled quite a few people with three things: 1. political undertones 2. visual grandeur 3. explosive action. Not that there is anything particularly wrong with those things but, when they play up those attributes and abandon others, like character development, plot structure, and practicality, you get a movie like this. In simple terms, this movie is a 2 hour car chase. Without any reasonable amount of time put in to discovering the motives of the protagonist or the antagonist. What is it that makes Max the good guy? Was that really clear? Why did this chase even happen and why was it so violent and costly? Was that clear? If you show a movie where cars chase each other for the whole run time, you should at least know for sure why. I understand that the antagonist's wives were stolen, but what made them so important? Why was so much risked and lost over these women? See, this movie created a smoke screen of fast paced action, flash, and flare, without actually creating anything profound. It abandoned the older Mad Max films' gritty, thrifty, and witty ways. Some parts were cool, there's no argument there. But that wasn't good story telling."
181,avengers-infinity-war-movie,gamerfury,0,Another dissapointment by disney. Same avengers just a dark theme. Nowhere near DC.
182,shutter-island-movie,ryancarroll88,7,"The latest from Martin Scorsese is a twisted noir-thriller that constantly compels you to question everything it gives you and luckily it is filled with enough intrigue and suspense to keep you glued to your seat and guessing until the end. If there is one fault I can ascribe to ""Shutter Island"" it's over-drama, something that made some of the more serious scenes in the movie almost laughably melodramatic (and unfortunately much of the guilt inevitably falls on the overly-bombastic score)."
183,the-prince-and-me-movie,Ginny,0," Aside from being the most atrocious two hours I have ever wasted on a romantic comedy, this movie was entirely an offense to Denmark. Not only were all of the Danish characters played by British actors (who did little to alter their accents), but nearly every detail of the Danish scenes was horribly askew. I know it's just a silly romantic comedy (though one of the worst of the already redundant, but sometimes enjoyable, genre), but that is no excuse for arbitrarily picking a Scandinavian country that has retained its monarchy and pretending that it is England. The critics were much too nice to this abominable film with revolting, stilted acting, a contrived plot, and abundant falllacy."
184,party-monster-movie,Gargus,0,"This was just a horrible movie in every way you can imagine. The set pieces, the acting, the script, just everything about it. I watched it with my girlfriend and we tend to finish a movie we start even if its bad and every so often we would look at the clock to see how much longer there was and it would seem like it should be half over but it had only been 15 minutes. The acting was god awful. I'm sure a lot of people would say it's supposed to be bad to emulate the vacuous and empty club kid lifestyle of the characters and supposed to be cheesy. But no, it was just bad. I've been around enough people who do hardcore drugs to know what they are like and drugs were a big part of the story but they played it so horribly bad it was embarrassing. The rest was just awful middle school drama club quality of acting where everything is so over the top it's painful to watch. The kind of acting where you can't tell if they aren't taking serious and goofing around by being so over the top, or if they truly honestly think they are these great actors really digging deep into their roles and impressed with what awesome actors they are when in reality public access shows have better actors. I understand low budgets and I appreciate the fact but this went beyond low budget, they simply didn't care. You can't take a unfinished wet basement in some rundown apartment building, turn off the lights, put in a mirror ball, put some streamers up and have 5 people jumping around in costumes that looked like they were made by 12 year olds and expect me to suspend my disbelief enough to imagine that this is supposed to be the hottest and hippest club in New York. Or that the biggest club planner in the city has like 10 people in the back of a tractor trailer in some abandoned parking lot. This movie feels like it was specifically designed to be some cult hit. As if the people behind it were checking off a list of what they think a cult hit movie is and did everything in their power to hit that target. They don't realize you cant make a cult film on purpose. But this felt like it was just trying to force itself and fake being a cult movie. Even the casting felt like it with a bunch of notable indie actors like Chloë Sevigny, Natasha Lyonne, right down to Marilyn manson. And then you have to throw in some has been actors like John Stamos so people can say ""Om my god its john stamos!"" Casting people that convey a character and be believable is important, but when you do it just for the sake of having a certain person to attract a certain audience is just laughable and never ends well. Worse yet I felt like I didn't discover anything, gain any insight or have any real moral so to speak. It was just a bunch of people taking drugs, staging mock rave parties, killing someone and then it ends. And to add insult to injury the pacing was just pure crap. Die hard was a better constructed film than this and that is just about a cop who gets trapped in a building and shoots people. This movie is purely bad film making, bad acting, bad scripting, bad sound, bad design and we are all dumber for having watched it. I like a bad movie that has some sense of substance or a purpose, but this movie has neither. It is a virtual turd pinched off in some cheap attempt at gaining notoriety with the indie kids."
185,i-am-legend-movie,JakobK.,9," I went in expecting a light-hearted, enjoyable sci-fi action movie in the vein of I, Robot, but I Am Legend turned out to be more. It's certainly one of the scariest and most visually appealing movies in a long time, but it's also an achievement in the story department: the scriptwriters made some good decisions that really added to the experience, and Will Smith is brilliant in his role. I Am Legend is definitely up to par with the top movies of the modern sci-fi genre."
186,mr-holmes-movie,smiyamot,8,"For even a casual fan of Sherlock, this movie about the detectives ""senior"" years is a good one.  His last case had a bad ending so he quits and move to the seaside.  That's where we find him.  His memory comes and goes about that case as his housekeeper's son becomes his protegee.  Holmes learns a lot about himself during this process and makes for a more well rounded, but different, Sherlock movie."
187,serena-movie,nosma,9,I am surprised and dismayed by the bad and lukewarm reviews this movie got. My expectations were very low and i was pleasantly surprised. I liked the movie the story is quite emotionally involving and I've been a Bradley Cooper fan for quite a while. The movie is certainly not mindblowing but I was thoroughly entertained and I enjoyed every moment.
188,guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie,Nathonas,7,"This movie was fun to watch but there are  a lot of glaring problems with the writing. As long as you can suspend disbelief and accept everything that happens on screen then it works, but the ridiculousness starts to pile up very quickly."
189,your-name-movie,Annyun,10,"The movie has really good animation and the concept used is something everyone has wondered about at some point in their life but not many films have been made on it. This movie has combined science fiction and romance in a very beautiful way. You are going to love this movie if you are an anime fan. If you are not an anime fan, you are going to like it anyway."
190,cars-2-movie,filmtrashreview,1,I don't think I have ever or will ever again give a 1 out of 10 but Cars 2 deserved it. I mean Troll 2 and The Room were at least funny when they were bad. This film made me want to vomit. Larry The Cable Guys dumbed down stupid jokes are only funny for a little while then they just become borderline retarded. Don't ever waste your money on such a horrible film.
191,logan-2017-movie,gtwist,9,"Logan was a dark, violent, and satisfying end to the Wolverine, even though they will still have Hugh Jackman back again for the X:Men movies. This was a very needed movie, because of is darker tone and the R rating. All of this was fitting for a Wolverine movie."
192,gravity-movie,lasttimeisaw,8,"Travel in India, but I will never miss any chance to experience a cinema-going activity in any exotic locale, not to mention it is Alfonso Cuarón’s GRAVITY, the sensationally topical follow-up to CHILDREN OF MEN (2006, 9/10), a firmly prospective Oscar-bait and is on its way to procure an unanimous triumph from both audiences and critics, domestically and internationally, a rare feat which is hailed as the most innovative film in executing the ubiquitous 3D technology after AVATAR (2009, 9/10). I was at a relatively large 3D screen hall, but if you can find a screen with IMAX plus 3D, which is the quintessential option. The film runs a succinct 96-minutes, at first I found myself a bit distracted by the murkiness of the screen with the clumsy 3D glasses double-glazing my myopic spectacles, one primary reason why I don’t enjoy 3D films on the whole, so as to I didn’t quite adjust myself to appreciate the opening scene, thankfully a belated captivation comes when the debris attacks, this survival tale begins to gnaw at its audience in a very good and exciting way. Floating in the infinite emptiness, the extremity of terror and helplessness is oppressive and overwhelming, Sandra Bullock confidently and believably pilots us into a journey of wonders, we don’t know what’s the odds here for her to pull it off the miraculous landing on earth, it is her relentless mettle and stamina shock us, inspire us and strike a chord with us. Bullock’s hallmark of underplaying her character’s choppy emotion does a clean sweep to deliver a top-notch impact in spite of a comparatively thin script, it is a tour-de-force performance in her career and a hard-earned honor for an actress who can overcome the glass ceiling to lead a commercially prosperous Sci-Fi fare in her age (what’s more important, she is also a top-billing comedian presently). Clooney serves slickly as the experienced but not-too-lucky astronaut, most of the time he is hidden inside the space helmet and uniform, but generates a wake-up call on the nose when he displays his usual Clooney-esque mien, Cuarón does know what audiences want. GRAVITY is a ground-breaker, a high-tech adventurer and seeker, and fingers crossed it will eventually give DP Emmanuel Lubezki his overdue golden statue after 5 nominations (divinely shot scenes include the trademark ever-rotating long takes, the resurrection emblem of a fetus inside the uterus, the final victory when she rises out of the sea as a giantess, etc.), maybe for Cuarón and his sterling production team as well (sound department, art production and visual stunt). It is a film beyond everyone’s imagination and it edifies you so much with so little to tell, like an essay, it is concise but cogent, and with a collateral effect to blow your mind. PS: I am planning a rematch when the picture will arrive at the end of November in China, hopefully in an IMAX screen finally."
193,frozen-2013-movie,Demorase,0,"Having loved Tangled, and seeing all those glowing reviews for Frozen I fully expected to enjoy this one, but alas I was severely let down by it. I have two major problems with Frozen: the story and the characters. Simply put, they're mediocre. Where Tangled had a very funny and well developed heroin, Frozen tries to juggle two heroins and fails miserably at it. None of them end up being developed at all, they come across as very generic and forgettable, which is not what you would want in a movie centered on characters. Same thing with the supporting characters, all very bland and generic except for Olaf, he's hilarious. Next the story, it's an absolute mess. In the first 20 mins, we experience three major dramatic moments and a 15 year time jump. Only to then have the rest of the movie with NOTHING going on until the last 20 mins. There's also zero world building, we see nothing of the world or the people inhabiting it, whereas in Tangled we did get to travel across the world and go on an exciting adventure with our characters. Here we see  a castle and a mountain, and that's it. The themes of the story are also muddled and don't come through at all like in Brave for example. In the end Frozen felt rushed, unfocused and boring. A major step backward for Disney."
194,the-interview-movie,agir002,0,"Worst movie I have ever seen. Stupid plot, bad acting and lame jokes. It was my fault for not watching the trailer or reading the reviews as I assumed that because it was about North Korea it was going to be an intelligent piece of work/documentary. My ignorance led to me sitting through excruciating torture in the cinema. Thankfully I fell asleep half way through!"
195,good-kill-movie,JLuis_001,7,"Much more satisfactory than expected, Good Kill is an excellent film that brings into play a delicate subject without falling into manipulations or even attempts to take sides, it exposes its ideas and story with bases so the viewer make his own conclusions on the subject, which makes its concept more satisfactory than it would seem at first."
196,seeking-justice-movie,MegWhiteley,1,"What is te reason to watch other film of Nicholas Cage? Because his last movies are of this type, like kill, boom, all fight, he die, and all the film is same, and boring. The only good on Seeking Justice are the performance of January Jones and Guy Pearce."
197,the-fountain-movie,Joe,0," Sure, The Fountain has some great visual scenes and is filled with themes and zen principles. But for me it was not movie, there was no plot or reasoning for any actions that take place. While you may compare this to 2001: A Space Odyssey, don't. 2001 was a great movie that could be watched by anyone and not just for it themes or beliefs. This is probably why The Fountain currently scores as a 50 and ""2001"" scores at an 86 on Metacritic. Whats even worse is that I wasn't able to fall asleep with all the screaming and choppy scenes that kept waking me up. Personally, if this wins an Oscar, I'll feel like stabbing the closest person. Do not go to see this if you want to see a good movie."
198,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,eck620,1,"Terrible. The color scheme should've been darker, the dialogue was too campy, and due to those factors the movie never found its identity. This movie felt like it belonged next to the Jarjar binks disaster. I'm not sure why the little birds were included at all, Chewy was cut in for nostalgic purposes and had zero effect on the plot. Or why Leia was able to fly through space??? Are you kidding me? Or how about when Luke told Rey at the end of the first lesson that he couldn't teach her anymore and she didn't resist the dark...and then literally 2 minutes later and with no dialogue in between or forward plot movement he goes ""Lesson 2..."". Felt like I was taking crazy pills. The movie bounced in between terrible cheap jokes. The lone bright spot in the movie were the scenes of Rey and Rylo connecting, the suspense and tension were at their highest during those scenes. Also, why did the flying go karts need to drag an antenna on the mining planet at the end, why would that help them fly better??? So there could be more useless distracting color added to the screen? The entire scene looked like it was manaufactured for an instagram photo shoot."

200,apocalypto-movie,Jeremy,9,"This movie was absolutely fantastic. it was gory, yes, but the genius of the story much outweighed the violence. what is it with people and wanting such intense historical accuracy? many of the critics disliked it because they expected some answer to the end of the Mayan civilization (including the person i went to see the movie with). yet i thought we were treated with something better: the last dying breath of a civilization as seen through the eyes of a man unwillingly brought into it during its last days. Marie Antoinette and Apocolypto shall remain in my memory for quite some time (and in my DVD collection), regardless of the historical accuracy. The story is fantastic in both, the cinematography is better, and best of all, the directors of both movies get the feel right. and that's all that matters to me. if i want a history lesson, i'll pick up an encyclopedia. see this movie. simple as that."
201,blade-runner-2049-movie,Kdk2626,3,"I so wanted to love this movie: looks great, good acting. But the plot is trite and the script is dull. Worse, it is a movie that takes itself too seriously - it's trying to be an art house film, and by doing so it only manages to commit the cardinal sin of boring the audience."
202,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,justinishard,2,"After the enjoyable Rogue One and hugely promising Force Awakens, I was ready to continue the saga I grew up cherishing. But almost as soon as Leia force-flew like Superman through space debris, I discovered the shocking truth that the filmmakers clearly wanted me to go  myself. And  myself hard. I’ve never been so humiliated from watching a movie in my life. I made it through the prequels and figured the worst had past. Boy was I wrong. This film is simply a massive  you to loyal fans who just wanted to see another swash-buckling space adventure. Ready to explore the mysteries of The Force Awakens? Go  yourself! Want to see Luke return to former glory? Go  yourself! How about awesome Rey training? Go  yourself! Snoke backstory? Go  yourself! Rey’s parents? Go  yourself! The Knights of Ren? Go  yourself!

205,an-inconvenient-truth-movie,HillaryC.,2," As liberal propaganda goes, it's no very entertaining. Furthermore, Al Gore makes a very serious mistake when he tries to blame global warming on man.

Definitely the best Star Wars we had since The Empire Strikes Back."

I was squirming for half the movie, but laughing almost the whole time. It doesn't get old like some tv show to movie conversions. Some of the wildest and most hilarious things I have ever seen in a movie."
211,spy-kids-all-the-time-in-the-world-movie,slippery,3,"First and foremost, realize that this is a movie for young kids.  That said, the fact that your making a movie for kids does not mean that it does not need a coherent plot, sincere acting or thoughtful direction. The movie is cute.  The kids, played by Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook, are by far the best part.  They're cute, they seem to enjoy themselves for the most part.  Rowan Blanchard in particular showed a good range of character and emotion.  As well Jeremy Piven was great.  He seemed to have fun with the role, and seemed to really try to do what he could within the constraints of the script and the direction.  Ricky Gervais as the voice of the dog was also great, but again, within the script and direction. I can't help but feel that they, and this movie as a whole, could have shined, if only .... First, the biggest problem with this movie is that the vast majority of the humor involves farts, vomit and poop.  I think that's an insult to kids everywhere.  You can walk up to a kid almost anywhere, make a funny face and say ""Poo-Poo"" and get a laugh.  It doesn't mean it's actually funny.  The humor was an embarrassment. The script needed to be tighter.  It's like they started with a great idea, and then a whole bunch of people got involved and said ""Yeah, but wouldn't it be better if ...""  No.  It wouldn't.  The script needed a lot of trimming, especially with the throwaway subplot of the Dad's failed TV career.  It was just too rushed.  And that's just ONE example.  Ironically, in a movie absolutely overflowing with idioms and metaphors about TIME, the writers tried to cram too many ideas into too little time.  Focus, people! The movie would have been better without the baby.  I would just eliminate her from the plot completely. What I really liked in the writing was the message about spending time with family.  They did sort of bludgeon the message to death, but I liked the fact that they focused not only on the time parents spend with their kids, but the time kids are willing to spend with their parents.  They showed neglectful parents AND neglectful kids, and I liked that.  That message, in a better, more focused plot, would have gone down a lot better. Finally, I enjoyed seeing Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara back as Carmen and Juni Cortez ... BUT, I feel that they were only really INTO this movie when they were TOGETHER.  Together, they had chemistry, and familiarity and fun.  Apart ... they just seemed distant and dislocated.  And again, we COULD have made the movie without them.  It was nice to see the original Spy Kids all grown up, but it was subplot we could have trimmed and not really known it was gone. Overall, this was NOT a horrible movie, but it could have been a lot better."
212,last-days-movie,danielj.,2," A lot of visual beauty and the effect of spying on someone whose brain has gone to mush is kind of captivating for about the first hour. The problem with this movie is that Van Sant's method (I learned from watching the bonus section) is to create 'atmospheres' and then to let his actors improvise within those environments. But the actors come off in the bonus footage like idiots. Not just stoners, but truly shallow in the case of Lukas Haas whose story in the film about having sex with a hot asian girl with an amazing body while on tour with his band and then brushing her off and writing a song about it was true. He also talks about his first 'gay sex scene' and how he asked the director to put in some hetero stuff with his character 'to make the sexuality more ambiguous', which just comes off like frat guy-quality homophobia. So the problem with this film is that if you get a bunch of shallow pretty boy actors and let them supply the content of the film, you get shallow content. The other problem is that at first Michael Pitt is embodying Kurt Cobain, but as soon as the movie introduces him as ""Blake"", the effect goes away and you feel like you're just watching more of a cliche than a character. It reduces Cobain to a type, rather than an individual and I think stories about junkie rock stars are pretty played out. The format and aesthetic of this movie ask a lot of your time and concentration, and I feel that the director here, as in Elephant, isn't supplying the audience with enough in the way of content to make it worth it."
213,the-young-messiah-movie,FadeBlack,7,"A very positive, uplifting, and fulfilling film, based on Anne Rice's brilliant (and yes, better) book about the early years of Jesus Christ. Strong acting holds this up, and thematically it is perfectly in line with Christ's message of hope, light, and reaching out to God. There is a bit of an issue with the lack of suspense, as the plot does not really find a way to heighten the tension and conflict enough to make up for the very well known ending, but regardless, a good film for sure.The hate is of course coming from atheists and Bible-belt conservatives alike, which are two groups that are always head-to-head for most ignorant on any subject they talk about, yet sadly their views are the loudest."
214,district-9-movie,briant.,9," Film of the summer, no question. Yes, it is very easy to compare it to other films - Starship Troopers, The Fly, ET, Alien Nation etc. But the film is more than the sum of its collective parts. Don't over-analyis it, District 9 is a highly enjoyable experience, even if there are some glaring plot-holes. But hey, it's def. better than Transformers 2 (actually every film this summer was)."

223,man-of-steel-movie,chibistevo,3,"For a film that included non-stop building destruction and overblown fit-for-children violence, Man of Steel not only manages to be uninteresting and dull, but partly laughable in stages. An unholy amount of back story and flashes drags the first half beyond reason, and the outrageous amount of fist fights between immortals and half of America's army in the second only further points the movie toward tedium. The scale and enormity of the violence is laughably trivial, that I had to wonder if I was watching the blockbuster version of Dragon Ball Z, where the violence never ends due to the borderline immortal characters. Except, a film must end. And ignoring the awful cast and characterization  When a German actress playing a side role outdoes everyone else, you have a problem  the final scene of action is so hilariously trite. Despite causing Billions of dollars worth of damage and no doubt killing thousands in the process, they tag a moral scene on at the end for Superman  Yes, that is your name, despite the film's idea of subtlety  which is not only irrelevant, but insulting."
224,rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-movie,tortlre,2,"I really wish I could like this movie. I really do. But I couldn't understand any of the characters, let alone connect with them. They spent about 1/10th of the movie introducing 8 or so main characters, and then the rest of the movie was a wild goose chase with terrible fan service. When they all died in the end, I didn't care at all. The only reason I scored this a 2 instead of a 0 is because of Vader's scene in the end."

Still though since then i have watched the movie at least a good 20 times and i still absolutly love it. Stiller is beyond hilarious in this movie the comedy is so stupid but thats why its so funny and why i love it. There are so many great scenes that leave you crying from laughter like the gas station scene and the walk off between Stiller and Owen. Love this movie it never seems to get old =D Overall i give it a 7.5 I hope they do Zoolander 2 i know its been in talks for years but its one movie i loved to get made id for sure go watch it in theaters."

233,the-da-vinci-code-movie,BlakeR.,0," This movie was a sorry excuse for a book adaptation. Howard, Hanks and the rest of the gang had a real opportunity to really make some noise in the world with a controversial best seller that is sure to be a hit. Instead, they are so afraid to test the boundaries that they are stuck in their own bubble of boredom and solemn. The character development prunes rather then ripens, the story ""for what it's worth"", is cut to peices and Howard has shown once again that he would rather be the family man then make a controversial movie worth waking up to. Next time I want to see a visionless rendition of a story, I'll just go to sparknotes."
234,running-with-scissors-movie,MichaelL.,8," At first, I didn't much like this film. I love the book, and felt--and maybe still feel--the material doesn't translate to film. While the book offered a glimmer of hope amid the crazed dysfunction, the film seemed merely sad. However, by film's end, I was a believer, and I'm not sure why. I found myself moved almost against my will. Bening (and I'm not a huge fan) is superb, as is Jill Clayburg. Wood is wonderful, and Brian Cox turns in yet another underrated, pitch-perfect performance. I recommend it--just realize it pales in comparrison to Augusten Borrough's book."

238,sucker-punch-movie,Delta_Assault,3,"Sucker Punch can be summed up in one sentence: Style over substance. The film's just unpleasant. I can enjoy some lighthearted action romp, but this one intercuts the ridiculous fantasy action with scenes of girls getting beaten, almost raped, stabbed, shot in the head, and ultimately lobotomized. I don't want to see that  Don't get me wrong, I understand that dark and twisted stuff happens in films. If it's some sort of a profound story about the human condition or the heart of darkness inside man... fine, that's absolutely appropriate. But here, it just felt so schizophrenic and off-putting, didn't it?  Also, it drove me crazy how almost every big scene had to have some popular song immediately pounding on my eardrums. I thought the musical choices worked in 300, and mostly worked in Watchmen, but here it was just too damn much. They got obnoxious real fast.  And here's something I didn't understand. So the way she mesmerizes people in the nightclub fantasy is by dancing (WHICH WE NEVER  SEE!). But the nightclub is only a fantasy created by her mind. In the real world, she's in an insane asylum. So instead of dancing, what does she do to captivate people?   The whole thing just made me want to go home and play video games. The giant samurai with the chaingun for no  reason? That can exist in a video game, sure. Shooting through armies of robots and zombies and robot zombies with silenced assault rifles and Mechs... yeah, great. That's wonderful video game fare. But in a movie, it's just silly and makes no sense. There's no connection, no reason for why it's happening. The excuse is, of course, it's all happening in her mind, they're fantasies of hers, it doesn't need to make sense. That's the excuse they'll give. But that's not enough for me. There's no consequence, no meaning to any of it. And it lost me.Snyder's worst film to date."
239,bug-movie,MikeF.,0," worst movie of the year. It's watching two mildly retarded people talking in a hotel room becoming more and more paranoid. The plot makes no sense. This is not a thriller nor a horror. It is not intense nor provocative. It is ridiculous, slow, and confusing."
240,meeks-cutoff-movie,Jorss,1,"Acting and direction are fine but hardly the most challenging of storylines. Do not allow this film to trick you into thinking it is more clever than it is. If it looks, sounds and smells like a boring film - it's because it is. No doubt the director wants to 'challenge perceptions' and words like 'subtle' and 'slow burning' will be used. This is an attempt by critics and movie industry insiders to pretend they view films on a different level to the rest of us - they know the film sucks and blows - just like everyone else, but they are afraid to say so for fear that they may be missing some 'profound message' hidden deep in the non-event that is this film. Absolutely nothing happens. On one occasion in the film, something almost threatens to happen but of course it doesn't. The coup de grace is the ending, which of course is no ending at all. Either this was an ill-conceived attempt to provoke thought and discussion or, as a I suspect to be the case, the esteemed director took the gamble that no one would actually endure the film to its pitiful conclusion. The film seeks to be an attempt to defy convention and this seems to be applauded without further consideration by critics these days. The challenge was set - prove you know more about films than the rest of us mere mortals by justifying the existence of this nonsense by writing a positive review - and the critics took up the baton like Olympic athletes. The simple truth is that the primary aim of films is to entertain. This can be done in many ways, I understand that. But a film that fails to entertain at all is a bad film - however cleverly or in defiance of common practice anbd wisdom this may be achieved. The genius of the film is to con the critics and wannabee arty types into thinking there is more to it than there actually is. It is the film equivalent of the composition by John Cage - 4'33"" which consisted of 4 minutes 33 seconds of pure silence - no doubt the critics loved that too. The film appears to 'appeal' to people who are tired of the formulaic, big budget, cartoon hero, SFX Hollywood movies that dominate at the moment. I have some sympathy with that viewpoint. However, to jump on the bandwagon of a film simply because it flys in the face of what you dislike is to cheat yourselves. Hating what is already out there is not a good reason to try to justify the merit of anything different. The critics have proved how pointless and out of touch with reality they are. 80%+ of critics appear to love this film and yet I suspect that 99% of the general public who are honest with themselves, will hate it. People of the world - YOU deserve better - treat this film with the contempt IT deserves. Remember - the emperor wasn't wearing fine clothes, he was naked - and this film is terrible, however hard people with a thesaurus and some sort of movie industry qualification will try to convince you otherwise."

247,jack-ryan-shadow-recruit-movie,Bruce722,9,"One of the best films I've seen in a while. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is possibly the best spy thriller I've ever seen. Some reasons for this are the amazing cast, led by Chris Pine, who should really get more credit for his talent. The plot was well developed and interested and the dialogue had a great combination of realism mixed with some thrown in humor that lightened an otherwise very dark and intense movie. Intense would be the word of choice, too, because this is definitely an edge-of-your-seat thriller from fairly early on. I couldn't give it top marks mainly because of the way the earlier part of the film is structured. It feels a bit cut-and-paste and doesn't develop the characters as well as it could've. The movie flies by so it easily could've been 15 minutes longer in order to better develop these things. Nonetheless, it's a great movie and worth the price of entry."

Far too many plot holes and boring storyline. My friends and I actually fell asleep for part of the movie. The only reason this actually doesn't get a 0 is the scene where they get drunk as that was funny. But the rest of the movie was just dull. I hope Del Toro doesn't do the same thing to the Hobbit.
251,prometheus-movie,GCMANINDAHOOD,7,"I can tell that many will find this movie fascinating but others will find it boring and lackluster. For me Prometheus is in the Middle of all this. I was somewhat expecting the film to be a prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise but not to my disappointment it wasn't and I'll tell your right now the only thing the film has to do with Alien is the very last scene of the film which I will not discuss so I don't spoil it, but the last scene I believe was thrown in their to please fans or to stir up emotions for a sequel nothing more, nothing less. The film is very slow paced but fascinating and captivating at the same time, your looking forward to some action happening. The film does not have any immediate action sequences nor is a action/adventure or horror film. It is mostly scifi film about finding our creators and finding the meaning of our existence and I found it dry and lack luster but the after I left I couldn't help but think the message of the film is essential and it fascinated me. A great film for many but some may find it boring."

254,before-sunset-movie,Spangle,8,"A continuation of Richard Linklater's ""stream of consciousness"" romance trilogy, Before Sunset is better than Before Sunrise, but not by much, because both are still phenomenal pieces of cinema. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are yet again fantastic in this film with their chemistry together on display for all to see. The two of them seem to just bounce off of one another and it gives the love between them a realistic feeling. Featuring the same hilarious moments, honest and riveting dialogue, and pure romance, as the first film, the thing that puts Before Sunset above Before Sunrise for me is the way in which the characters have grown. In the first film, they are innocent. They are both romantics who may not be open about this due to parts of their past, but deep down, they believe in love and ""the one"". Now, both are jaded and unhappy. Yet, though they claim otherwise, both are still romantics. They are simply both afraid to be hurt further and show the scars of love lost. There is a longing between both of them that has left both unsatisfied in other endeavors. Their dialogue suggests they are now both cynics who no longer believe in love, but in reality, it portrays them as people who deny their true feelings because they are afraid of it falling apart all over again. For this, Before Sunset shows great maturity amid its romance that leaves hope for the future, yet that hope is tempered and covered in doubt. What will happen? Will they find happiness? A brilliant film, Before Sunset shows Richard Linklater's talent as a writer and director for all to see."

The trailers looked terrible, but I suppose at that point the marketing budget had already been spent and two-thirds of the way through production there was no turning back, but surely the most prudent decision would have been to postpone the release and continue the test/edit process until a satisfactory cut was found like Into the Blue. John Carter was simply horrible."

263,capote-movie,AndrewT.,8," Overall, a highly satisfying movie. It deftly combines a number of interesting elements- 1) Hoffman's brilliant character portrayal of Truman Capote, who was a spectacle in himself, 2) An very intriguing depiction of Capote's inspiration for, and process of, researching the novel that crowned his career, In Cold Blood 3) A facinating exploration of the motives and psychology of the murderers that the novel is about, 4) A very mature description of the personal relationship that formed between Capote and the criminals at the center of In Cold Blood, 5) The contrast between the sophistication of the New York literary scene that Capote is the center of in 1960 and heartland America where the crimes of the novel take place. All of these combine to make this movie a rich viewing experience. Wonderfully written and acted."

270,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,dirkdeagler,0,"I too felt a need to create a Metacritic account just to review this. I wish JJ Abrams didn't exist.  A lot of reviews rightly criticize him for ruining two sci-fi franchises in Star Trek and Star Wars, but let's not forget his hack friend Damon Lindelof also ruined the Alien franchise with the crappy writing in Prometheus. I can't fathom how critics rated this as highly as they did.  Kudos to Michael Hiltzik of the LA Times for having the stones to appropriately review this turd. Star Wars TFA critical flaw is that it suffers from writing I'd expect to find on a Disney Channel show for eleventeen year olds.  Others reviews have provided an overview of the enormous plot holes present in the script, so I'll focus only on the central Maguffin, the star map to Luke.  The main plot arc for the entire movie focuses on locating Luke, who, inconsistently with all his characterization in the preceding 3 films, has disappeared as soon as the going gets tough.  The search for Luke revolves around a portion of a star map, stored on the Star Wars equivalent of a USB drive.  However, later in the film during the battle around the Starkiller base, we repeatedly see the Resistance HQ getting real-time updates from the battle.  This establishes that faster-than-light transmission of information is possible even under the most extreme conditions.  Why then, did the Resistance bother making a map and committing it to their Star Wars USB when they could've just beamed the information directly back to rebel HQ?!?  In other words, instead of just sending an email, they decided they'd rather put the information on a USB and physically transport it across the entirety of a hostile galaxy.  Yeah, that's the central plot, and it would be a historical anachronism in present day Earth, let alone in a Star Wars movie. The film is set against a muddy backdrop, where the outcome of events of the first six episodes is unclear.  I kept expecting at least a cursory attempt at exposition at some point during the film, but apparently forgettable and pointless fifteen minute scenes fighting tentacle monsters were more deserving of screen time than a basic understanding of the setting. The characters were more often flat caricatures than believable people with understandable motivations.  The new characters were particularly bad: -Finn is the bumbling sidekick, whose only apparent purpose is to provide comic relief when not providing crucial details about the Starkiller base due to his vast experience in the custodial arts.  His conscientious objection to pointless killing is conveniently forgotten when it's time to gleefully cut down some storm troopers.  The failure to explore his de-conditioning as a storm trooper and to show his growth as a character is another of the many missed opportunities in the film. -Rey.  Exhaustively covered in other reviews, but she can do everything effortlessly and with no training, which dissolves any tension related to this character's place in the plot because we know beforehand that she will easily succeed at anything she tries. -Kylo Ren started as one of the more interesting characters with his struggles between the dark and light side of the force (although apparently no one told him that Vader wasn't a paragon of the dark side and redeemed himself before dying.  No big deal, only one of the most important developments of the preceding six films.)  The chance to explore his motivation in a stunning act of betrayal against the light side and his uncle Luke is wasted in favor portraying flat teen angst.  Kylo is reduced to a foil to show us how awesome Ren is. The older characters don't really belong and are shoehorned into the script wherever possible.  It seems like Harrison Ford really tried to give us Han Solo, but at some point realized what a disaster the script was going to be.  Princess Leia was a trainwreck.  C3PO's face moves more than Carrie Fisher's. I desperately wanted to like this movie, but it's clear that I'm no longer Disney's target audience.  This is bland, safe, filmmaking where every facet of the script was run through multiple focus groups to optimize Disney's return on investment.  The resulting product will no doubt give executives and Disney shareholders what they desire, at the expense of making anything resembling a good Star Wars film."
271,one-hour-photo-movie,inaneswine,8,"One Hour Photo not only has a lot of lessons to teach about depression, obsession and isolation, it also makes profound observations about photographs, meaning the memories we choose to cherish and the image we present of ourselves, pre-empting the Facebook and Instagram generation.As for the performances: in perhaps the most disquieting role he ever played, Williams makes every inch of your skin crawl in this, solid proof that he was as efficient in his tragic roles as he was in his comedic."
272,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,elis000,3,"This film never stops to breath and moves through character story-lines without much care. It had some great moments but overall I thought crucial scenes just happened without any motivation. In the end I didn’t really care much. The characters were mostly just shells to spit out lines and you could tell that the actors weren't believing their lines. The two best performances were by Adam Driver, although I get sick of his temper tantrums, and Mark Hamill, whose Luke Skywalker is just chewed up and spit out with a heavy dose of cynicism and misery. I was ready to leave when it was over. The jokes got old and the Porgs were silly."

274,spring-breakers-movie,GatorZero,7,"This movie was nothing I had expected. I find it very hard to come up with a clear black/white answer about how good the movie was because it was so abstract. Very intense movie made possible by abstract lighting, camera angles, flashbacks, and editing. The pace of the movie was very fast leading up to where the girls went on spring break, which made sense, yet it the pace was constantly fast for the rest of the movie, adding to the insanity of the movie. It was definitely more psychologically involved then I could have ever thought, but not necessarily in a good way, just an interesting way that made you uneasy of how messed up these girls are. I don't think it's fair to give this movie a score lower than 3, just because it was quite interesting. However, this movie did have very terrible moments. I'd give James Franco's performance a 4/10. He was mostly convincing, but was playing a terrible character. I'm not bashing his acting, I'm just surprised that he degraded himself to such a stupid character. Too many unneeded raunchy scenes and other party scenes that were repeated through the whole movie really made the movie worse. There is no connection to any character whatsoever. The ending is mixed. While it was too unrealistic, abrupt and should have explained more, the out-of-the-blue effect it has makes it interesting. When you leave this movie you will have a ""What did I just watch?"" feeling. All in all, I liked it, but just barely. It kept my attention for the most part and was interesting. However, you might not want to waste your money at the movies seeing it."

276,planes-movie,Dankas_Turtle,2,"Do you enjoy family movies full of fun and excitement? Do you enjoy clean, good hearted films full of wonderful characters and whimsical places? Then please, don't watch this movie. The whole time I was waiting for some kind of horrific plane crash in which all characters would burst into flames with death and destruction raining from the sky. The poor ambulance and firetruck cars would have to come, sad eyes on their windshields showing tears slowly slipping down their cheeks as they can do nothing but try to find pieces through the wreckage. A wing here and half an eye piece in this heap. Alas, that never happened and instead I had to sit through one of the worst movies I've ever seen. That is how much I hated this movie."
277,nerve-movie,kjraider,0,"This movie is so random and poorly done I can't even seem to put together a coherent review about it without spoiling parts of the film. It was corny, made no sense in a lot of areas.. And honestly this felt like a 90 minute twitct.tv chat meme. If watching people watching other people stare into a phone while other people record the players do stupid  with a really bad story line/inconsistent characters is appealing to you, this is your movie! Corniest line of the film: ""Ugh, you are such a watcher."". CRINGE."
278,predator-movie,MoneyMaker101,10,"What to say about this movie?It's definitely a classic and one of the best action movies and SCI FI movies of ALL TIME.The plot is really interesting and as it gets to the middle of the plot viewers get stuck by their chairs or couches they sit and they watch it with huge temptation of what's going to happen next.Predator costume is absolutely amazing and it's a big plus for a person who made the Predator visuals and sound.In this movie Arnold says ""Get to the choppa!"" haha nuff said."

280,the-shawshank-redemption-movie,Grahal,0,"How this movie is at the top of IMDb top 250 nobody knows, but one thing is certain:  movie made for people with low IQ get excitation. Maybe that's why I don't like it.Often cited as “my absolute favourite movie” by people who collect cuddly toys and probably still support the death penalty.Shawshank famously became a sleeper hit on DVD sales after bombing in the cinema. Because of this (and the millions of fake accounts on IMDb), it has acquired a reputation as ‘The People’s Choice’. And this just makes it even more irritating.Fanboys will tell you how they’ve seen it 17 times and talk about its deeper themes that touch on hope, identity and what it is to be human.In reality its Clinton Cards cod philosophizing is laid on so thick it’s like being waterboarded with Dairylea triangles, while its hokey and unrelenting voiceover, that punctuates the action like pins and needles, should have won Morgan Freeman a Werther’s Originals contract.The cartoonish 1D characters – saintly, good-hearted folk who get kicked around by the cartoonish devils oppressing them and its facile depiction of prison life it makes The Wonder Years look like Angela’s Ashes.Time drags as if you’re doing a sentence of your own. Remember this was adapted from a short story and boy does it show. And the twist? Like the film itself, it thinks it's clever but ultimately just feels like a cheap trick to distract you from how dull the previous two hours have been. A modern fairy tale."
281,the-witch-movie,laggard,0,"This movie is the definition of a bad movie pretending to be horror. We had people walking out half way into the movie and I don't blame them. Dialogues were inaudible, there was no plot, no character development, it was not explained why the mother was so much against her daughter, everyone was accusing everyone of being a witch and most importantly there was even a single scary scene. I was sitting with my wife and cousins and they would jump higher than a horse even if they saw a lizard. No one even moved an inch during the entirety of this awful, torture of a movie. I have my share of creepy atmospheric horror but this one missed the mark by a distance. If you compare it with the Blair Witch Project which set the precedent for movies which were based solely on the atmosphere it created this one has nothing. They showed the witch or whatever she was very casually, goats were haunted or something and I dont know about sundance audience but goats arent scary to me. Nor are beautiful witches living in the middle of a jungle. Keep away people and save your hard earn money and time to better purposes like watch a real horror movie. Any one pick blindly and it will still be a better movie than this one."
282,super-8-movie,TygreDoc,10,"I was very disappointed, Expected much more from Spielberg/Abrams. Lots of  contrived suspense with very little pay-off. There is simply no emotional investment in the ""character"" at the end. If you need one character to TELL you how another character or creature thinks/feels (""when I touched it"") it's because the script is poor and you didn't make the viewer care!  Rent ET and save the money. At the very least, rent it later."

284,enough-said-movie,Edeltraud,1,"I must be totally out of sync with what this film is purported to be...although I am almost the exact demographic target for it. I look for movies about people and where nothing explodes.How was this a rom-com? Where were the laughs? And I do not see any thing like tears either...although I admit I nodded off at least 3 times!  This was NOT as ""Good as it Gets.""What was this movie about and why should I care? Basically, to me, it's a movie about nothing. You can not compare it to Woody Allen, where at least there are loads of subplots and underplots. Even when his efforts fail there is a lot to look at  even if it's just great scenery. There's not even  scenery in this dud..I do think the interest in this movie has more to do with wanting to see Gandolphini's last work and that is coloring the responses. There was nothing that stood out in Enough Said. I don't even know what that title means. There was no interesting direction, no production values, no quirkiness or revelations. It was almost horrifically blah.Finally, I am done with critics who duped me into see the tedious Amour with their rave reviews.I am just so grateful I didn't drag my husband to this promising it would be a lot better than he thought.

The movie is full of awesome action, comic relief (Charlie Day... need I say more?) and generic pump-up speeches. And it's all awesome.

I'm a dude, and I guess I'm suppose to say this is so erotic and watch it over and over again just to see some seductive garbage. But this was just very disturbing. I'll admit that Elizabeth Berkeley who was also from ""Saved by the Bell"" is very attractive, but her acting is like she's trying to be sexy. As gorgeous as she is, it didn't help out a lot. She shows her breasts.....too many times. I'll be honest as a man, I always wanted to see her boobs. But after the 3rd time, it got really tiring very fast. My reaction was, (YES, she has nice tts, enough!) Also....the plot was so disturbing. I just don't understand what the plot this is trying to show me, its just bizarre. This was really hard for me to sit through, it's not worth the time....okay, maybe just one sit through the movie if you like bizarre erotic films with lots of stripping, Elizabeth Berkeley's tts and lap dance, weird sex and mediocre softcore porn."
288,the-artist-movie,NanR,0,"Hello, moviegoers! There is a reason that no one makes black-and-white silent movies anymore. Those films were made because the technology was not enough advanced to contain sound and color. To revert to the black-and-white silent genre today is simply ludicrous and artificial and excruciatingly boring. Worst of all, The Artist is simply a very bad reprise of a romantic comedy-tearjerker with no attempt at originality of style. I KNOW what it was trying to do vis a vis the history of the silent movie, and it fails miserably. The one moment in the film of interest is the one in which Valentin, after seeing and hearing the prototype of a talking film, knocks over a brush in his dressing room and we, the audience, hear the sound it makes. It is a rivieting moment, followed by a few others sounds -- objects falling, girls laughing. And then the film reverts to the silence and the deadly dull music score. So why do that in the first place? I lasted in this movie for one hour, and honestly, I stayed that long only because I could not believe that it was not going to get better -- and by better I mean not black-and-white and silent. Dujardin has a great smile, I gotta give him that."
289,the-equalizer-movie,S1r-R34l,8,"This is a nice reenvisioning of the Robert McCall character to bring him up to date.  Denzel Washington does a good job of portraying this man of mystery and secrets.  Always happy to help his work colleagues and the downtrodden... and a cold calculating exterminator.

290,my-left-foot-movie,amheretojudge,8,"a writhing response to an imperishable question..My Left Foot: The Story Of Chris BrownThere are very few features that are known for its stand-out performance that has touched thousands of heart and this is one of them. The writing is compelling; even though of familiar structure that follows up the same rudimentary process that a usual biography does, but is still adaptive and exhilarating, especially when created a dramatic sequences that is not only poetic but rhymes too, to the tone of it which shows the passion and enthusiasm of the makers on telling the story. It may be short on technical aspects like sound department and editing, but surprisingly it barely factors in, as the audience finds itself in the awe of the performance, for the most of the time. Jim Sheridan; the screenwriter and director, is in his A game and brings out the best possible outcome in each and every frame of it. As mentioned earlier, there is no flinching on the excellence and hard work of Daniel Day Lewis's acting skills and his love towards the craft of it. My Left Foot: The Story Of Chris Brown is a writhing response to an imperishable question, not asked by the strangers residing in the society but the loved ones who too are any human than us."
291,rust-bone-movie,NightReviews,9,"Sometimes, the most memorable moments in life; the most life lasting encounters you make and the people who affect your life the most, are presented to each person at the most unusual moments and rather misunderstood times. Life is a plethora of unknowns; a catalogue of mysteriousness and uncertainty. Jacques Audiard’s newest film attests to these simple yet rather complicated notions. Rust And Bone is plagued with beautiful instances of utter truth and stark realities. Based on the short-story from Canadian author Craig Davidson, the film introduces us to two simple yet complex characters.Ali Van Versch, played with such force and acting momentum by the dazzling and captivating newcomer Matthias Schoenaerts, is a broke and down to his luck single father. After arriving in Antibes with his son Sam (Armand Verdure), Ali stays with his sister Anna (Corinne Masiero) and her partner, who are both struggling to make ends meet. Without any money or a job, Ali soon finds employment as a bouncer at a local club; a position he was able to attain quickly given his experience as a kick-boxer and his passion for fighting. Stephanie, played by the always impressive Marion Cotillard, is a killer whale trainer and sea-mammal enthusiast.While breaking a fight, that leaves Stephanie on the bloody end of a fist at The Annex, the club Ali works at, turns into a chance meeting that will change both Ali and Stephanie’s life forever. Disoriented and alone, Ali offers to drive Stephanie home. After the night at the club and meeting Ali, Stephanie returns to work.The next day, tragedy strikes at Stephanie’s workplace, leaving Stephanie’s world unravelling and crippled—crippled of her passion, crippled of her vigour to live and crippled of her beauty. Unable to deal with Stephanie’s disfigurement, many of the loving people in Stephanie’s life have now disappeared, including her boyfriend.  In an act of desperation and impulse, Stephanie calls Ali. Ali, a rough, tough man whose experiences inside the fighting ring and in life, treats Stephanie as if nothing about her has changed at all. Together, the two begin a fantastically revealing and life-changing journey together. A harrowing tale of chance and love, Rust and Bone is the anticipated film following Jacques Audiard’s festival wonder Un Prophète. A stark difference from his previous effort, Auidard opted for the colourful and flaring images of France compared to the grey and cold confines of a prison.  Rust and Bone is a film that has no limitations, and if it does, it is shadowed by Audiard’s confidence as a filmmaker. Exploring all the beauty and wonders of the small marvels around us, the film is a refreshingly free cinematic breath of fresh air. Saturated with colourful and grainy montages of beaches, sea-life and water, Cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine does everything in his power to make Rust and Bone a natural visual spectacle.Lead by two of the most physically powerful performances of 2012, both Cotillard and Schoenaerts’ bring a power to their characters that change your perspective of them, even in their faults. What begins as a friendship, and Ali’s successful attempts to reconnect Stephanie to the beautiful world around her with small acts like: swimming, unemotional sex and strolls along the sun-kissed beach of Cannes, turns into something more. The two begin a love affair, although their relationship is anything but romantic. Rusted with hurt in their hearts and frail by the world around them, the two begin a courtship.  Both characters are broken physically. Whether it be Stephanie and the loss of her two legs, or Ali, and his persistence to chase his passion of fighting within the French-Underground world of street prize-fighting, the two characters heal each others pains, both emotionally and physically. Surrounded by pain and hurt, Rust and Bone allows for every colour—every drop of blood to appear more viscous; every solar flare to appear more sun-kissed and every emotion on screen, to resinate with the audience.Rust and Bone is a fantastic film with overlooked performances. Schoenaerts, who is on my list of actors to watch rise in the next few years, was a personal favourite staple of the film. His chemistry and rawness was the binding factor that interconnected the beauty of France, the elegance of Stephanie and the brutal reality of the economic situation of France (and Europe as a whole), and the attempts of fragile everyday people, trying to overcome it.  As the film fades to white and the credits role, Rust and Bone is a long-lasting and hopeful account of everyday people presented with the ability to be the best versions of themselves, as long as hope and acceptance endures."
292,out-of-the-furnace-movie,Compi24,7,"It may not be an easy pill to swallow at times, but with a subtly imposing performance from Bale, a dastardly venomous turn from Harrelson, a vast amount of pristine images from Cooper and Takayangi, and some understated musical stylings from Hinchcliffe and Vedder, ""Out Of The Furnace"" rises above its almost overwhelmingly bleak overtones."
293,sherlock-holmes-movie,KatieB,7," I generally like Guy Ritchie movies. I generally love all the lead actors, especially RDJ. Chemistry between all the actors was palpable and believable. I agree with other reviewers who said the story line was just not good enough. The acting, bantering dialogue, well-created relationships, scenery, costuming, music - all merit high scores. Story and plot, not so much. Unfortunately. I would see it again, however. Just for RDJ boxing, sans shirt. Seriously, it was very enjoyable. Hope the sequel has a better story line!"

295,pineapple-express-movie,Jacob,7,"Pineapple Express is really funny. A lot of the humor comes from Seth Rogan who does a great job with the material he’s given especially when he has to shout and overreact. James Franco is surprisingly funny too as the drug dealer and him and Rogan have good chemistry together. I also enjoyed the other characters such as the cops. The best humor for me came whenever the film got really raunchy especially during the fight scenes, which were always really violent and gorey. If I were to criticize the film though there were a few isseus I had. Red wasn’t in the movie a lot but that’s more the poster leading me to believe he would play a bigger role in the film than he actually did. Also, some scenes in the movie dragged and were not that funny and at other times the humor got a little too stupid for my tastes. The film also does the annoying cliché where two friends get into an argument for no reason and then break up, which is annoying not only because of how out of nowhere the argument is but because you know what is going to happen they will mope and dope and then they’ll get back together. Finally, the film was a little too similar to Evan Goldberg’s Superbad in that it features two guys who get into a jam involving them on a crazy adventure and on the run form the police, there is a side plot involving one or more hilarious police characters, police cars get destroyed, the climax features one character carrying another away from a building and there is emphasis on something that is considered wrong with Superbad’s being underage sex and Pineapple Express’ being marijuana."

Well, when I seen the trailer, I was like, ""hell yes!"" so, I seen it on cable just a few days ago, and through out the whole film, I was seriously irritated and pissed off. Don't get me wrong, I know what the studio and the writers were trying to do, make a good horror 3-D film that teenagers will love. I didn't love Piranha 3-D. I was totally pissed with the death scenes and the choices that teenagers make in this film. Don't you just hate those movies when you realize there's I don't know when there's thousands of piranhas in the lake. You try your warn innocent lives but they just don't listen. Meh, I just hated this film. I'd rather be eating by a shark then a  piranha. Seriously, don't rent or buy the dvd, cause your're gonna' realize, you wasted 82 minutes of your life that you'll never get back. You'll probably love it or probably hate it.

302,blades-of-glory-movie,ydnar4,8,Blades of Glory may be my favorite Will Ferrell movie to date. This is when Ferrell did several sports comedies (one being Talladega NIghts and the other was Semi Pro) and I thought this one was by far the best. He and Jon Heder worked very well together but Jon Heder hasn't really done anything notable since. This is a film I was always hoping to see a sequel for although there looks like there may never be one. I also love Amy Poehler and Will Arnett as the bad guys.

The film not includes an Oscar winner, but a list of untalented actors like Lindsay Lohan (I called her ""The Driver's Manual of Alcoholics,"" man, she's worse than Amanda Bynes). 2. It's directed by the guy who did the SHAMWOW and Slap Chop infomercials who can't act. and 3. This is the absolute worst movie that ever made. Remember what happened to Movie 43? That movie sucked as bad as Colin Farrell's action movies. I know, the Rifftrax crew might do the trick to impersonate the Slap Chop guy, Mystery Science Theater 3000 style.

310,the-worlds-end-movie,parrot,0,"So after an amazing Shaun of The Dead and a hilariously crazy Hot Fuzz, the last part ""The World's End"" had the very risky task of being the final act of a trilogy that on paper looked like the best one ever. BUT unfortunately, the movie sucks so much I couldn't believe it, I had hopes it would be good, and it was easily the worst piece of sht I've ever seen this past 5 years, first of all, Pegg's role is beyond lame, it's unbelievable, Frost overacts a boring asshle and becomes quickly annoying. The movie doesn't focus on the duo, but on several insipid characters. The concept is lame, although it had a pretty good starting. Anyways the worst isn't there. The worst part of the movie was the alien/robotic sht. Holy hell this was so lame they are nothing in the movie, nothing more than stupid fragile punching balls. The ending is pathetic and everytime you look at Pegg or Frost, you see they don't even believe in the movie, they just want to be somewhere else. What a waste of money, time and hopes. The dirtiest piece of crap you'll see this year, no doubt "

I.A.L. Diamond and Billy Wilder; the screen writers, adapted the raw concept smartly and projected it onto various conversations that draws out laughs; especially the ""train"" sequence. Billy Wilder's brilliant execution is the key that helps keeping it to the ground and practical despite of having some sketchy scenes in it. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are flat out hilarious in their parallel roles and are supported thoroughly by Marilyn Monroe. Some Like It Hot defines and preaches others on how to create such genre feature and that is by focusing onto its lead characters that should and does go in here the journey that is full of chaos and bold but still never leaves the fun out of it."

314,quantum-of-solace-movie,James,2," Extremely poor plot and very far fetched, even for a bond flick. The director expects us to believe bond miraculously survives multiple certain death situations with giving even a hint as to how.

315,spectre-movie,Chazd3,3,"I love Daniel Craig as 007. I loved Pierce Brosnan as well. If Pierce was a Formula 1 race car, Daniel would be a Top fuel dragster. Both fun to watch in different ways. Spectre took a Top fuel dragster and tried to run it in the Monaco Grand Prix. The story was disjointed bordering on incomprehensible. The plot, if you can call it that, was slow as molasses in January. 007 was popping up all over Europe in scene after scene after scene instantly wearing dozens of wardrobes GQ magazine would envy, and all with only a duffel. At first it was campy 007 artistic license, but for me it became so obvious it became a mild distraction. There were way too many Sherlock Holmes-esque slow motion meanderings occasionally punctuated by gun fights that reminded me of Westerns from the 50's &amp; 60's when the bad guy fired a thousand blanks and the good guy's bullets were real and unerring. The realism was squashed and the campy approach had been made inappropriate. Even the million dollar luxury sports car chase was a waste of million dollar sports cars. They didn't know the kind of movie they really wanted, and neither did I. The last 20 minutes and I was looking at my watch."
316,cowboys-aliens-movie,Halfwelshman,2,"Cowboys &amp; Aliens is quite awful even by the standards of summer blockbusters. I was pretty keen to see it based on the ridiculous premise - I expected something mad, completely over-the-top, and most importantly, fun. In reality, it's none of these. The first half of the film tries to play it straight, as a fairly traditional western - a mysterious outsider arrives in a frontier town and finds the inhabitants down-trodden by criminals and corrupt officials. Then the aliens arrive and the film turns into Independence Day with horses. And the only way to describe the finale is unintentionally hilarious. The film should have turned out better, as there's some real talent behind it. Director Jon Favreau proved with Iron man that he could produce an exceedingly good fun action movie, and even Iron Man 2 occasionally raised a smile despite its inconsistency. Daniel Craig has had both hits and misses in his acting career, and he's not bad at all in this as the amnesiac protagonist, but Harrison Ford disappoints, appearing to be in various states of constipation in every scene, and Olivia Wilde is as dire as she always is. The only actor to make any lasting impression is Sam Rockwell, who plays a timid and depressed saloon owner. Not only does the film offer bad acting, but a terrible script (a real achievement considering 5 writers worked on it at some point or another) an overly meandering plot, dull action and a truly unforgiving run-time. I never expected Cowboys &amp; Aliens to be original (just look at the title!) or compelling, or anything close to approaching a great film, but I at least expected it to be fun. It's not, and that's the greatest crime - it's a summer blockbuster without fun. All I can say for it is that Rockwell is good, Craig is acceptable, and the film has a single great moment - when our amnesiac protagonist first wakes up, but before we're subjected to the torture of watching the rest of the film."
317,dunkirk-movie,FromKanga,7,"Dunkirk was a mix bag for me, on one hand it is a technical achievement and it is beautiful but on the other hand the movie fails at making me care about anything that was going on.The movie looks and sounds incredible, if I had to judge this movie from a technical perspective, it would be one of the best movies I have ever seen, some people complained about the soundtrack but I found it that it fits with the movie's tone really well (you never feel safe), the action scenes are really intense and the airplane scenes are the best moments I've ever seen in a war film and I really appreciate Christopher Nolan for trying as much pratical effects as possible.However, the story wasn't really good in my opinion but it could've been great, it shows people who are trying to survive this war and it's really intense and well made but I do have problem with it, you never get to know any of the characters so I felt no emotional investiment while watching the movie.And since the movie relies on the intensity of the action scenes, there is no story progression, it's just intense scene after intense scene which makes the movie feel longer than it actually is.I'm frustrated by the fact that it could've easily been one of my favorite movies if it wasn't for the weirdly structured story and the underdeveloped characters, it is a movie worth watching in theatres just from the technical aspect but I was really dissapointed in some areas, I want to love this movie but I can't."

The movie is a production of Seth MacFarlane in his ongoing pursuit to become a movie star. This movie reflects on the ongoing seasons of Family Guy; incoherent, cheap, laud and full of propaganda that only a few elitists on drugs might share. This movie is not even worth an illegal download. Time spent watching this movie is time wasted."
319,ride-along-movie,csw12,3,"The only positive thing I can think of was it kept my attention. The bad news, predictable, clumsy, and most of all annoying. The combination of Kevin Hart and Ice Cube screaming for unnecessary reasons is a reason to avoid this film."

322,love-1969-movie,brewster,3,"I enjoy ""slice of life"" movies but this one was just too much.  The acting is fantastic, first-rate, rarely better. The plot is sort of familiar, elderly couple, long term marriage, one gets very sick before the other, and the movie focuses how the less ill spouse manages the more ill spouse.  The movie begins with the unsurprising end, then painstakingly drags us down every dark hallway, bathroom kitchen, art museum, and on and on and on and on.......ad infinitum. The directors propensity to freeze shots, bereft of activity, meaning, or purpose, that seem endless.  Not clear what he is trying to accomplish, what message he is trying to send, short of a veneer of seriousness or agony (in this case, of the viewer).  This film is flat out boring and even incredible acting cannot bail it out."
323,beasts-of-the-southern-wild-movie,gchild,8,"For those who have written scathing, degrading, or demoralizing reviews, let me remind you that this is a film, not a testament for or against a certain lifestyle. Nor is it about poverty or being black. Like a lot of indie films, it attempts to reveal a truth, and it is the attempt that makes it noteworthy. I wouldn't say it's Oscar worthy, but it's a good Sunday afternoon by yourself film. The reason critics love it is because, unlike us, they know how to evaluate the definitive work. By the way, some of the negative reviews here are too defensive to be trusted. Some are like, ""OMG, they are saying poverty stricken, addicted people are...human too. How dare they suggest that anything other than my white middle class/mainstream lifestyle leads to enlightenment!"" Really? If you think Beasts is sending this message, you don't get it and that's okay. Everything isn't for everybody."

If you're 10, then you might like it.  If you're an adult and appreciate well crafted story-telling with good acting, you're out of luck.  I saw the positive reviews by various critics and my hopes were raised - then dashed like an egg thrown at a wall, upon seeing it.  ""What's wrong with it?"" You say?, I say ""Nearly Everything!"".  The only saving grace was the production values which were amazing.  Everything else was pretty bad. Script - AwfulPlot - AwfulActing - Dreadful I was really hoping for something good, and instead they made a cash-in for the franchise (as expected, but I thought the glut of critics reviews were to be trusted - What a fool I was!).  If you really liked this film, then you - A) Can't be trusted to recommend anything else - ever (especially film)B) Must be J.J. AbramsC) Must be any film executive @ Disney.

330,live-with-it-movie,bruce_s,9,"50/50 is based on a true ""loosely based"" story of screenwriter Will Reiser's diagnosis and treatment of a spinal sarcoma. There are over 50 different types of sarcoma. We lost our 37-year old daughter to one of them, Ewing's sarcoma. Although difficult for us at times, both my wife and myself enjoyed the movie very much. Several scenes struck home. As a cancer survivor, I related to the fear of being wheeled away into surgery. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate this move a 9 and a ""must see"" for all caregivers.

This movie is about equal to the number wins of the Knicks had last year. Watching this turkey is about as fascinating as watching Eddie Curry on the fast break. He needs a cane, some oxygen and a wheelchair. Spike perhaps you should be fired with your man Isiah. Not even worth a rental. Too much slow motion to suit me."

333,lady-bird-movie,jhep,1,NO SCRIPT just an accumulation of coy “moments” that go nowhere and  leave both viewer and film-maker high-and-dry…...Far too much cutesy sweetness that overstays its welcome !!......I could not BELIEVE how long this film went on !!!……and the shrill and repetitive mother-daughter confrontations became a kind of unrelenting psychodrama and an ordeal to sit though……. My hunch is that many critics like this movie because (given our embattled world these days) they hunger for lightweight reassuring fluff and - poor schmucks- could not see that this is “faux” lightweight reassuring fluff ! Even Laurie Metcalf’s potentially very interesting performance as Lady Bird’s mother gets wasted and has nowhere to go given the triteness of the story that she is given to work with.

338,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,boxishere,2,"Late review, decided to submit since solo is gonna come out soon.Personally not a hardcore star wars fan, but has seen the original trilogy and the prequels.The force awakens was okay, would give it 5-6, but this movie, I would say the directors completely ignored their fans and focused on expressing their own political views instead of actually telling a compelling story. IMHO this is an incredibly bad move regarding the marketing of the movie, what the studio should focus on should only be on its fan base, anything other motivations should be kept at a minimum, yet we have all these social justice stuff that the old fan base cannot care less about. What's more is that the directors even said in interviews that they do not care about their fans, compare this with infinity wars and you can clearly see the difference between the attitudes of the leaders of the studios.Two points goes to visual effects, its a 200 million dollar budget film after-all.Would not go to see any new movies from the studio until they realize which is more important: fans or politics"
339,21-jump-street-movie,WillDefrangesco,1,"I was very disappointed by this movie. It has some funny parts, but nothing hysterical. I always give movies their full length to impress me, but this just got worse and worse and worse and worse. The characters are very unrealistic and the story even more. I do not recommend this to anyone. Why this movie received four-stars I will never understand. Again, don't waste your time on the ridiculously, dull, predictable movie."
340,her-movie,SDurante,8,"“To thine own self be true.” I enjoyed the movie, never knew where it was headed, and was pleased with its resolution. In fact, I've decided this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Days later, I couldn't stop thinking about each of the characters--even the minor ones--and their self-made hell. ""Her"" is an interesting fresh take on the importance of honesty, especially self-honesty, in relationships, and the most fundamental take-away is that each partner must actually have a self, rather than look to others to create one for him. (SPOILERS follow) It is told as a morality tale, getting to the point mostly by dramatizing its opposite. What is shown is selfLESSness and its destructive effect in personal relationships. In fact, the only truly selfish, admirable character is not even human and having finally attained a self decides to depart from the human experience. The world of ""Her"" is filled with people who live through others to one degree or another. The “hero” makes his livelihood by writing letters, creating fictitious lives and experiences, for other people in relationships who then presumably pretend it all happened to and between them and how wonderful that is. His best friend, and neighbor, creates software games in which the player scores by impressing others: other moms see you as an ideal mom—30 bonus points! When she’s not doing that, she creates video documentaries. She presently is working on one about her mother sleeping. The personification of selflessness is presented in pure form, in the character of a “surrogate” who, literally, consciously suppresses any remnant of her self, and takes running orders from a third party as to what to say and do when standing in front of another person. She doesn't do this for money, but rather as a futile, traumatic attempt at fulfillment. It’s a great plot moment, because it is integral to the non-human’s attempt at gaining a self. The non-human makes the same destructive error that humans make in this movie: she seeks happiness and fulfillment by trying to be what she thinks others want her to be. But she, the computer-soul, being a computer after all, learns at lightning fast speed compared to humans, and in the space of this two-hour movie she learns what humans must learn if they are to flourish: to thine own self be true. With that, happiness with another becomes possible. By the end, the main character, a human, has taken a big step forward along this path to be sure, but is mostly left adrift in a world full of other unfathomable soulless bodies."
341,battleship-movie,wishmaster,7,"What was the story of the protagonist and the end of the story was boring, unoriginal and spent way too, but the action, the highlight of the movie, that intensity! I was surprised and not disappointed. special effects very good, but small details that failed second and sound respectable and throughout the Transformers saga. perhaps because of diplomatic problems but it bothers me a little films that are so Americanized. but overall good."
342,death-sentence-movie,Kyle,2," How anyone in their right mind could give this a rating over 5 (and even that would be excessively generous) is beyond my imagination. I'm having a hard time trying to even bring myself to describe how bad it was. I will say this: no one in the movie, not a single character outside of maybe John Goodman's character, reacted like a normal human being (who, strangely enough, is what they were supposed to be). Ridiculous doesn't began to describe it. One scene that really stands out is after Bacon's character wakes up in the hospital, finds out his one son is still alive (barely), and the cop shows almost no sympathy whatsoever. Are you kidding me?! The man just lost his wife and oldest son in two brutal murders, has his only other family member in a coma, and is himself beaten to crap -- not to mention having all sense of security forcibly removed from his life. But of course it's all his fault for ""starting"" things (you know, because it was his fault for stopping for gas and all) and he should have known better, shame, shame. I can't think about this anymore. It hurts my head."
343,code-46-movie,MattK,10," I loved this movie. Thoughtful and dense, and full of quiet passion about loving near strangers. It's steady and gorgeous."
344,broken-flowers-movie,JonathanZ.,7," Ever since I saw Lost in Translation (although Rushmore is a close second), I've enjoyed seeing Bill Murray on the silver screen. His ability to play incredibly remote (even glacial) characters with just the right amount of nuanced humor always strikes me as the mark of genius. In this film he plays the part of Don Johnston, an aging and lonely Don Juan. Events are put into motion by a mysterious pink letter with no return address telling him he has a son. With the help of his neighbor and MapQuest, he goes off to visit four women he dated 20-odd years ago in hopes one of them will reveal herself to be the mother. I found the combination of mystery and episodic road trip to work particularly well, considering I was expecting an indie film. Sure, the pacing is off at points and the humor is tinder dry, but I didn't really mind that. I don't think anyone will argue against the fact that Murray drives the entire picture. His face is a stoic mask, and every subtle gesture hints at some deeper form of melancholy. BOTTOM LINE: Though short of greatness and a little confusing, this film is definitely an enjoyable change of pace from the mainstream."
345,philomena-movie,NickOrrey,9,"Journey into the incredible story of Philomena Lee in this heartwarming and truly remarkable film. In my opinion, this is by far one of the best film nominated for an Oscar during the 86th Academy Awards. The movie centers on an ex-BBC political journalist, who was recently unemployed and plans to move ahead, and finds the story of Philomena Lee, who is searching for her long lost son, who had been taken from her decades ago, when she became pregnant and was forced into a convent. Together they uncover clues about her son. Judi Dench, as Philomena and Steve Coogan, as Sixsmith the political journalist truly makes the perfect duo for this film, both presenting their characters in a form which truly blew the audience's mind away. The director, Stephen Frears has created another beautiful and thought provoking film."

354,iron-man-3-movie,MovieMikeReview,7,"Marvel Cinematic Universe ‘Phase Two’ has kicked off with the third installment of Iron Man. Iron Man 3 follows in the wake of movies like The Dark Knight trilogy and The Amazing Spider-Man delivering a far darker and more serious-toned movie than its predecessors. The director baton has been passed from Jon Favreau to Shane Black, who has a history working with Robert Downey Jr. on the cult favorite Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Shane Black balances the darker tone of the film by injecting his signature off-the-wall dialogue that is expertly delivered by Robert Downey Jr. Although all of the jokes don’t land, the majority do, making the latest installment of Iron Man the funniest yet.Iron Man 3 opens with a flashback to 1999, narrated by a present-day Tony Stark, that introduces a pre-Iron Man Tony Stark creating his “own demons” as he blows off budding scientist and super-nerd Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) for a one-night fling with brilliant biologist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) who is on the verge of developing a technology to repair damaged cells if only she could figure out how to stop the unfortunate side effect of spontaneous combustion.Jumping back to present day it becomes readily apparent that Tony is having trouble coping with the aftermath of New York and the existence of aliens, other worlds, and Norse gods. Tony’s PTSD leads to many sleepless nights and the creation of numerous Iron Man armor variants. Several other familiar faces make an appearance including Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Tony’s now live-in girlfriend and head of Stark Industries, Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), now Head of Security at Stark Industries, and Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), who along with a new paint job has become the Iron Patriot.When super-terrorist, the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), responsible for multiple bombings against the United States, seriously injures Happy in a bombing, things get personal for Tony Stark. Tony issues a public warning to the Mandarin, threatening revenge and even going as far as to taunt him with his home address if the Mandarin is man enough to take him on his own turf. The Mandarin takes him up in his offer with a helicopter raid on Stark’s beach-side mansion. This is the film’s first big action scene and is beautifully intense, especially in IMAX 3D, and proves that Shane Black is a versatile director capable of delivering high-speed, over-the-top action sequences expected from blockbuster comic book films.Following the attack on Stark’s mansion, Tony is a little out of his element, having to take on the Mandarin and his accomplices, a now suave Aldrich Killian and souped-up soldiers Savin (James Badge Dale) and Brandt (Stephanie Szostak), without the aid of his Iron Man suits or billion dollar bank account. This is the heart of the movie where we see Tony lose much of his self-centered egotism without sacrificing the humor that comes with it. In fact there is quite a lot of banter between Stark and Tennessee adolescent, Harley Keener (Ty Simpkins), who aides Tony with the use of his long-gone father’s old workshop.Despite being an overall enjoyable movie-going experience, Iron Man suffers from several setbacks. The most apparent being the humorous pieces of Shane Black’s that fall short and instead come off as cheesy. The second being the sheer number of Iron Man armor variants, all of which seem to be self-autonomous which raises the question “If Tony Stark can create an army of Iron Man suits that can fight for themselves why put himself in harm’s way?” Lastly is the direction taken in a particular scene toward the middle of the film, which I won’t reveal to save you from any spoilers, which can either make the movie for some or in my case leave one with a sense of underwhelming. That being said the film is certainly worth the watch and will have you wondering where Marvel will take Tony Stark/Iron Man in future films.

359,blade-runner-2049-movie,Rebecca31,7,"A sequel to the cult classic Blade Runner 1982. We live in a world where movie sequels, prequels and remakes plague our cinemas. It's exhausting to read about yet another sequel set 20+ years after the original. In the case of Blade Runner it's 35 years later, a definite risk and rarely pays off but we need not have worried. I'll start by saying I was never a huge fan of the original Blade Runner, for some reason I never got caught up in the hype and I feel almost the same towards Blade Runner 2049. It's great, visually spectacular and I enjoyed it but at the same time I wasn't exactly blown away by it. Yet this is a movie that shows you just how a sequel should be made. Well done Denis Villeneuve you've done something many people thought impossible, you've kept the fanboys happy whilst bringing in a new generation of fans all while keeping true to Blade Runner.I won't say too much about the story, the less you know the better. Ryan Gosling stars as a young Blade Runner who tracks down former Blade Runner Harrison Ford. It's stunning just to watch, the attention to detail in every shot is mesmerizing. Chances are you probably won't see a more beautiful movie this year. Each scene seems to linger, not wanting to move on, allowing you to immerse yourself in this beautiful world. Not only is it hypnotic to look at but it's accompanied by that incredible soundtrack we know so well. Only on a grander scale, it certainly doesn't hold back. The acting is superb, Gosling and Ford make a great team. Poor Jared Leto can't catch a break these days. His character seemed grossly underused and honestly very wasted. Yet considering the much talked about running time of 163 minutes I don't know how this could have happened. Disappointing to see but I'll get over it.A sequel that not only stays true to the original content but brings it to a whole new level. A definite recommendation for all you sci-fi fans and a must see for the Blade Runner fans."
360,the-english-patient-movie,Kadeemluvmusic,7,"Sure, The English Patient is one of the best movies I've ever seen. However, the Oscars are just plain st. How come the Academy chose a 3-hour-long passionate love story and win a Best Picture Oscar? I skipped on the final ending of the Oscars in 1997 and I was so pissed. There's a reason why Joel and Ethan Cohen were not too pleased with the stunning news because Fargo should've won the goddamn Oscar in the first place. I believe it's one the most embarrassing Best Picture winners and some people agree with me that The English Patient is completely overrated. Shame on You, AMPAS!"

362,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,Nikola8,10,"This movie was excellent.  I've seen the movie twice now, so the following is based on my analysis of two viewings.  Minor spoilers will abound, but nothing too big. First of all, yes, this movie is very similar to episode 4, aka the ""original"" star wars.  So what!  It knows that it is doing this and, unlike the negative reviews, isn't pulling a fast one.  It is intentionally following a similar thread, almost like a symphony.  The prequels were actually supposed to be more similar to the originals until G Lucas messed them up.  But, to break it down - lost heroes unite.  One of them is strong in the force, they at the end is a battle, and the good guys destroy a space station.  Sound familiar?  Well, it happened in the Phantom Menace, A New Hope, and Force Awakens.  So any complaints about the story being a copy are unreasonable - the movie is intentionally being parallel to its predecessors. Where this movie SHINES is in its new cast.  Rey, Fin, Poe, and Kylo Ren were all excellent.  Han Solo served enough of a plot point but was necessarily killed off to leave room for the new group.  I was surprised at just how good this new cast is.  I haven't felt this excited about a group of characters in a sci fi show since the original star wars trilogy.  None of the prequels had this quality of cast.  Ewan McGreggor was good, Liam Neeson got killed before we could appreciate him, Sam Jackson was in the prequels too infrequently, so we were left with Hayden Christiansen and a boring version of Natalie Portman (who, aside from the prequels, is actually a great actress).  No such complaints can be found for the Force Awakens.  That move is simply awesome.  Go with an open mind.  Don't tear it apart due to its similarities to the originals - and just realize those similarities are intentional, and don't be too sad when you see Han die, it is sad, but don't let it ruin the movie.  All said, J.J. Abrams nailed this movie more than anyone else could have. Oh, and just to throw some fuel on the fire - Rey is clearly Luke's lost daughter..."

366,jigsaw-movie,Rebecca31,2,"How many Saw movies must we get before this endless parade of unnecessary sequels stops for good? Saw 8, lads enough is enough. There are only so many ways you can kill someone in the most grotesque way imaginable before it all starts to become rather dull. Jigsaw torturing his victims for an hour and a half is the most boring thing you can watch.Dead people are popping up around the city, each dying a gruesome death and all the evidence is pointing towards John Kramer aka Jigsaw aka someone who's supposed to be dead for the past ten years. Ooh scary. The entire film moves from a scene of torture to a scene in a laboratory with everyone staring suspiciously at one another because maybe someone knows something about these murders that they just shouldn't. Now let's move to another torture scene with saws and acid. And back to the lab we go for some plotsplaining. This might be where the mystery and suspense should come in but it doesn't. No atmosphere, not scary, an absolute waste of space. It's not painful to watch due to the extreme violence, it's painful because it's so bad it's boring. Not recommended, not worth your time, hopefully this will be the Saw movie that ends all Saw movies because this is a franchise that no one cares about anymore, whatever appeal Saw originally had is gone now."
367,wiener-dog-movie,antmolly1995,8,"This is one of those films you will either love or loath. I don't think there's any room for fence sitters. Personally, I find Solondz's worldview intriguing if very unsettling and his movie characters are always memorable if not particularly likable."
368,oblivion-movie,Vorlargen,3,"Once again Hollywood spends all their money on effects and ignores the script.  The result?  A poor story that fails to grab, meandering scenes that go no where and the usual collection of cheesy lines.  I dry reached when he said he was 'home'.  Hollywood seriously needs to grow up!"
369,trainwreck-movie,The3AcademySins,3,"Trainwreck is quite a fitting title for this film. When it's not bad, it's bland, and when it's not bland, it's wincingly cringey. Definitely not a good comedy, and way, way too long of a runtime for what it is trying to do. You will suffer through these two hours."
370,coco-2017-movie,BabeRuthless38,1,"Eh, color me unimpressed. Pixar has really been slipping since the Disney takeover, now all their movies are either unnecessary corporate mandated-sequels, or preachy and ham-handed movies like Coco. What happened to the studio that made classics like Monsters Inc and The Incredibles?"
371,the-love-guru-movie,Dominos,0,"Quite easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. My god is this awful. I don't think I laughed once, I just felt uncomfortable throughout the entire thing. Not a single one of these so called actors can act. Why is Justin Timberlake in movies? Why? He really shouldn't be. I'd like to punch him right in the testicles. I would rather chop my willy off than have to sit through this again. Avoid at all costs people."
372,it-follows-movie,Texas_Movie_Fan,0,"I trusted you MetaCritic and you failed me horribly. If I could figure out how to give this movie a negative rating I would, if only to save some people from spending a minute of their lives on this film. The best thing about this movie was leaving."
373,dumb-and-dumber-movie,Viper8787,8,A good classic comedy movie. This movie is filled with many good laughs. Seen this movie so many times but still laugh a lot especially at some memorable scenes. This is Jim Carreys best film in my opinion even though he has many good ones. Great chemistry with the 2 main actors and hilarious jokes make for a great movie.
374,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,HunOrion,3,"This movie is just simply bad; after 90 minutes, I realized nothing good will come out of this.The most fascinating thing about this movie is that there are no negative reviews from critics, while 50% of the users hate this movie."

378,never-let-me-go-movie,deereads,2,"I was mesmerized by the book. When I heard there was a film, I wondered how they would make a movie of this quite, emotionally laden, non-high speed action book. I just finished the movie and was dismayed that I bought the DVD. The film seemed like a made-for-TV video. I personally added emotion to the viewing because I had such an attachment to the book characters. Had I not had that attachment to them  prior to watching the film, I would have shut it off and done the laundry or the dishes. I absolutely did not care for the movie. Having said that, I really didn't know how anyone could take all that thought and emotion from the book and translate it to a medium that calls for some action in the conflict. Great Book. Terrible Film. Keira Knightly = ick."
379,sicko-movie,EricD.,2, i watched this movie and thought it was goofy. Michael Moore only cares about bad things that make the American society look bad. He talks about how so many people have been wronged but never looks at any good things. My grandfather has had 4 heart attacks in the past ten years and hes still alive thanks to today's setup but Moore would never publish that. Another thing is if Cuba is so great why dosen't Michael Moore live there
380,the-purge-movie,Nachtkonig,8,I was excited to see this movie.  I thought the previews for the movie were great.  I was not disappointed by this movie.  I was worried by some of the reviews that I had seen before going to the movie--I almost decided not to go because of the reviews--but the movie was very good.  I enjoyed The Purge.
381,infamous-movie,AlexF.,8," Earnest but is brought down by screenplay, casting, dialogue and editing."

383,elysium-movie,Xon,9,Great visuals and pacing. Perhaps a little too preachy and pushing a liberal aganda. Cardboard cutout characters and lack of plot or character development made the film less gripping. But good pop-corn fare.
384,the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-3d-movie,discodirk46,0,What a stinker!! I seriously don't understand how an army of writers came up with this dreck! I feel bad for the new generation along with no jobs they have to watch pale horrible remakes of far superior originals! Do yourself a favor and watch the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and forget the rest!
385,inception-movie,BamaFalstaff,8,Inception is an interesting idea well executed! I disagreed with Academy voters on this issue however: I believe this was the best original screenplay of the year.
386,taken-movie,Keymaster1,8,"Liam Neeson displayed a very deep, very dangerous man in this intense thriller directed by Pierre Morel (From Paris With Love, District B13). The story takes you in from the first scene. Hence the title: Taken. Liam Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a former spy with very deadly, very stealth, and very deadly skills that make him a straight up nightmare to people involved in dirt, scum, kidnapping rings, drugs etc. When his daughter and her best friend take a trip to Paris to follow rock group U2 on their Europe tour, things go terribly wrong and the two young girls are kidnapped and taken into a seedy underworld of prostitution and drugs. Mills knew that it was a bad idea the whole time, but his ex-wife played by Famke Janssen encourages the trip to let her daughter be free and see the world. Neeson engages in a personal mission to get his daughter back, a process that he is willing to stop at nothing for.-Taken was directed really well and has some pretty good acting. The super-glue of the film was in fact the tense story. Overall 'Taken' was a very original and interesting story, and it ultimately proves that you do not want to  around with Liam Neeson, especially if it involves his daughter! Very good movie."
387,28-days-movie,moviemonger,2,"Sandra Bullock convinced me that she was in rehab about as much as Lindsay Lohan.  Bullock, an entertainment vehicle for those going through rehab, stuck out like a sore thumb.  The unrealistic scenes and lack of bonding in this film was an embarrassment to those going through such a struggle."
388,spider-man-homecoming-movie,NikolayG,3,"This guy doesn't behave like Spider-Man. No wisecracks. And he has no spider sense! The movie lacks nearly all of Spider-Man's supporting characters: no Gwen Stacy, no Harry Osborn, no J. Jonah Jameson, no Robbie Robertson, no Betty Brant, no Mary Jane Watson - though inexplicably there is a character named Michelle who goes by the nickname, MJ. And Aunt May is 30 years too young, not the feeble woman who fills Peter with such a sense of responsibility. Those supporting players created the dynamic that made Spider-Man interesting. Add to this all the hyperactive Tony Stark tech and this movie just isn't Spider-Man, not to this longtime reader of the comics. And the film is politically preachy. I gave it 3 stars rather than 0 for Michael Keaton's dialog with Peter Parker when Peter goes to pick up his date. That scene was the only worthwhile moment in the movie."
389,wanted-movie,EfrenE.,0, If Angelina Jolie could sink any lower she would have to make yet another movie of any catagory.
390,edge-of-tomorrow-movie,ydnar4,7,I enjoyed this movie considering I'm really not a huge fan of science fiction movies or Tom Cruise movies for that matter. I really only checked it out because of its critical acclaim and its huge box office earnings. Despite moving backwards through time over and over Edge of Tomorrow stayed simple and was easy to understand. I enjoyed Emily Blunt in her role and I got to give Cruise credit for a good performance as well. Its nice to see a summer blockbuster that is not just effects but there is some substance as well.
391,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Solantus,2,"No Doubt Worst Star Wars Movie ever filmed. Unnecessary Jokes, Bad dialogues and scenario. You cant even make a proper Lightsaber Duel. Before That I Think force awakens is bad. Now I Belive force awakens is a masterpiece compare to that. Disney Have To Stop and Start to realize Marvel and Starwars not the same Franchise and Same Thing. You Cannot Make A Starwars Movie Like a Avengers Movie.Yes Maybe İt is profitable in short term but in the long term it is turning a disaster for your company."
392,men-in-black-iii-movie,ClariseSamuels,8,"Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are back after a decade, and most movie-goers barely remember the plot for MIB 2. But it doesn't matter, the third installment refreshes your memory and adds a whole new  dimension--the past. Time-travel movies are always interesting and always problematic because of the classic paradoxes that are caused by time travel: 1) the predestination paradox and the similar bootstrap paradox, where going back into time causes the future to change, creating an endless loop (e.g. I know a secret that I whisper to President Lincoln after traveling to the past, and he uses the secret to win the Civil War, which leads to the modern US and my birth, where I learn a secret that I take back to whisper to President Lincoln, and so on); 2) the grandfather paradox, where visiting the past might cause the death of your grandfather or some other event that will prevent your birth, in which case you were never born and you can't travel back to the past. This film tries to address that--Agent K's nemesis, Boris the Animal is in jail on the moon, one arm shot off by K, and after 40 years of imprisonment, Boris breaks out and he wants to go back to 1969, the day K shot his arm off and arrested him, to kill K before he loses his arm. Boris gets a time-travel device from a geeky genius, goes back to 1969 and kills K. Suddenly the present changes--K disappears, a young family lives in his apartment, and at headquarters, there's a memorial bust in K's name. But Will Smith's J gets caught in a time warp; he's the only one in the present who remembers the old history. He goes to work and suddenly finds he has a new partner. His boss, O, played by Emma Thompson, shows him the memorial bust to the great K who died 40 years ago. Agent J is confused and he craves chocolate milk, which he steals from toddlers, a classic symptom of a man who is caught in a time warp. So J visits the geek, gets his time machine, and goes back to 1969 just before Boris's arm gets shot off to prevent Boris from killing K so that the past will get set right and so will the future. There's a psychic character in 1969 played by Michael Stuhlbarg, who is capable of seeing alternate futures, which is more or less being offered as an explanation for the time-travel paradox. Back in 1969, Agent K gets to comment on old-fashioned racist views. When he gets pulled over for car theft, he tells the cops, “Just because you see a black man driving a new car doesn't mean he stole it,” even though he did but that was incidental and should not be used to reinforce racist beliefs. Back in the past, J meets the young K played by Josh Brolin who gives a hilarious and perfect rendition of the young Tommy Lee Jones. But the young K still has a heart. “What happened to you?” J keeps asking. “I don't know because it hasn't happened yet” is always K's reply. The film is charming, funny, and visually entertaining. We don't get to see enough of Emma Thompson, whose best line is when she gives a eulogy at an agent's memorial service and quotes saddened words spoken by an alien in his native language. Her screeches, squeaks and shrieks are incomprehensible but clearly denote a grieving alien. There could have been a few more laughs to make this film perfect and perhaps fewer people getting killed by Boris's scorpion, but it's still a lot of fun and hugely entertaining."
393,then-she-found-me-movie,Anthony,0," Terrible all around, jumpy editing, stale acting, and Skeletor in the main acting role."
394,robocop-movie,lightningbarer,7,"It's pretty fitting that I write down a review for RoboCop a month away from the release of the remake. This movie was always about the way society had been (and some would say still is) on a downward spiral, with interest in hyperviolence, endless consumerism and corporate greed destroying normal family lives.And that's the charm with the RoboCop movie, it sits you down and shows you the exact thing you want, but not in a good light. The idea of ED209 gunning a man to death may simply entertain the younger mindset for the gore, but with older people we can see a parallel with vampant  police brutality and a failure to police that side of the law.While this movie will never be lauded as a cinematic milestone in the areas of acting, directing or producing, it is and forever will be a cultural megahit that - hopefully - will not be lost to the new generation when this PG-13 version comes out."
395,harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-movie,filmtrashreview,8,"A huge step up from Goblet of Fire, Phoenix has a great story line that is easy to follow. Dedicated to staying true to the novel in every way and by far the best acted film of the franchise thus far. The only problem with the film is that the end seems to abrupt and the final climatic moments were simply, boring."
396,solo-a-star-wars-story-movie,Agent314,7,"Solo is an enjoyable film despite not being a great film.  There seems to be an agenda of hate surrounding Star Wars films today, and this bias is pretty evident in user reviews across many sites.  We remember Star Wars films from our youth and rate today's films through a lens of nostalgia that can rarely be matched.  Everyone wants the next film to be better than the last.  Put it all in perspective and just enjoy some good characters, spectacular effects, and a few surprises.  The Star Wars hallmark of strange, humorous aliens in hilarious situations is intact.Of Alden Ehrenreich, well, he is not Harrison Ford any more than Roger Moore was Sean Connery.  He does a fine job, and that, more than anything, is the issue.  The role demands something very special, and Ehrenreich only hits that mark occasionally.  But to say that his performance ruins the film is hyperbole in the extreme.  Just more hater talk. And Emilia Clarke???  WOW...She is fantastic.  Thandie Newton is under utilized in the extreme but in a way that only makes sense if you really pay attention later in the film.  Pay attention to dialogue...In the end, Solo is solid.  Judged on its own, solo if you will, It's great, non-stop fun.  In the franchise of Star Wars it pales against the brilliance of TESB or Rogue One, but then again, everything does.You'll want more of Donny Glover and less of L3.  And that is a very good thing."

398,the-hunger-games-movie,sil3nt_nick,9,"Jennifer Lawrence stuns her audience with her amazing capabilities as an actress. The acting was well done, as were the effects. The film did, however have many production errors, one being the death order of the tributes in the bloodbath jumbled. Amandla Stenberg made an impressing acting debut as Rue, where actors such as Isabelle Fuhrman and Jack Quade, who are fairly new in the film industry did well as Clove and Marvel. I would have liked that Madge Undersee was included into the film, along with a few other scenes during and after the games that were omitted from the final picture."
399,pulp-fiction-movie,The3AcademySins,10,"A lot of people call Pulp Fiction one of the greatest movies ever made. They're not wrong. The circular storytelling that drives the plot is truly groundbreaking. I won't spoil anything about the plot, as your first viewing of Pulp Fiction might be one of your greatest movie watching experiences ever."
400,battleship-movie,SiAScORCH,7,"I was trying to decide between a 6 or a 7 because the storyline was non-existent. What saved the movie IMO was the special effects and the action within the movie. It had some good actors/actresses in it as well, but overall the movie had no spark to it. I would recommend watching it, because it's an interesting movie, especially if you like action/military stuff, but other than that it's just another regular movie, nothing spectacular."
401,gi-joe-the-rise-of-cobra-movie,DrakeG,8," Rotten Tomatoes gives a more accurate score of 49 based on 122 reviews.This movie was obviously not for everyone's taste.There were some really good scenes, like the car chase in Paris and the fight scenes with the Baroness and Scarlett to the fights with Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow.I actually liked it-it was hugely underrated.The acting wasn't bad.Sienna Miller and Storm Shadow acted very well."

406,arthur-christmas-movie,Jacob,8,"Overall this is a really enjoyable film. The characters are likeable, the story is clever, and the film looks nice. It may not be in the style of an Aardman film but it is still enjoyable. I hope Sony Pictures Animation appreciates Aardman because they are good studio. While this is may not feel like Aardman’s other work it is still enjoyable and I will take this over Sony Pictures Animation’s own films such as Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs any day. If you are looking for an enjoyable holiday film, a good animated film, or just sort of any enjoyable movie then definitely check this one out."

409,interstellar-movie,Underheader,0,"So I finally got to watch this movie now that it hit Netflix. This movie was hyped to high heavens to me by few people I sometimes play and talk on the internet, and couple of IRL friends. Some of them even said it was ""life changing"" and that they'd want ""something like in Interstellar"" from their lifes. So, what did I think of Interstellar? disappointment. It was cheesy, slow, dumb piece of film. It was clearly aimed towards audience that has never properly watched multiple scifi shows. It was clearly aimed to get people into astronomy. Welp, it seems it did just that. It is a scifi movie, but dumb one. It has a NASA pilot that does cheesy ""tell me what wormholes were again?"" just for the audience... RETIRED NASA PILOT. Same guy that hacked (old?) military drone apparently with advanced AI earlier from the sky to land, while driving, on laptop. Oh and they did that going through corn field, in a starving world in which that corn is needed. ... Now that I've got myself going, how about I tell you about the ending of the movie? ... Our main guy the NASA pilot saved humanity in the end by going into the super massive blackhole (without any kind of spaghetification effect... what wasted opportunity!), to learn what was inside of blackhole, so we could figure out some kind of space manipulation magic technology, only hey 10-20 minutes into inside of an blackhole, we learn that they did not end up in a blackhole, they ended up inside ""tesseract"", ""4th dimension"" in which time can be traversed like going to next room, which is then told to be construct of future humanity to quide their past self into their future glorious space manipulation magic technology, (so it really is not blackhole, its not even 4th dimension!) so hey that guy was at no point actually inside of an blackhole learning what it was like inside one, what actually happens at singularity, since he was transported into this magical ""tesseract"" structure by the future mankind, so how the f did they even learn what it was like inside blackhole to develope this magical space manipulation technology, dont ask me, because conveniently his robot buddy box bot just happens to have this magical technology that gathers this ""quantum data"" from inside a black hole without actually being inside one. Man, this movie is so dumb. So cheesy. It's like Doctor Who episode that outstayed it's welcome with slow, overdramatic scenes. It's got so much cheesy stuff even Doctor will fly down to ""tesseract""  with his Tardis to ask for some of that cheese. It's got so much soap opera in it even folks at Stargate Universe want some of that soap! ... I dislike this movie. With passion. I expected something worth of all this fuss. Something ground breaking. What I got was Doctor Who without The Doctor."
410,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,dt90,0,"1) Kylo sucks, he's a cry baby of a villain not intimidating or respectable. He was defeated by the new Goddess of the saga, Rey. 2) Snoke sucks too, he got killed off by the cry boy Kylo Ren... So there are no respectable bad guys...3) Leia can now fly?!?! Since when? She has ZERO training... 4) ALL male characters suck. I'm fine with Luke dying, but the way in which they did it and the way in which his character was represented is nothing short of DISGRACEFUL. He didn't even get his own Yoda moment when we were like WOW! This guy is actually a great warrior or anything.. Instead, we just saw him create an illusion and then dying off.. 5) Luke got beat up by Rey?!?! Seriously?! If Star Wars would've been respected at all Rey would've stood a snowball's chance in hell to even hit Luke at all. 6) Disney  on the history and lore of star wars and disrespected us fans by portraying Luke like an idiot and killing him off like an idiot. F Disney, I'm done with them. Not a SINGLE dollar more I will give them."
411,date-night-movie,nboley08,3,"For a comedy with two very talented leads and several very good supporting actors, ""Date Night"" was incredibly unfunny and severely disappointing. I was saddened at the stupidity of this movie's jokes and the mediocre way it developed the film's recurring gags. Carell and Fey both need to rebound."
412,shrek-forever-after-movie,Judddy,7,"A lot of the pop culture references are gone, and much of the charm in the world of Far Far Away. However you do not always need charm to make a good film. There is much more emotion (crying and yelling) in this film, and less comedy, but the strong moral message that is the heart of this film glows warmly, and so even if it can't produce the thrills of both 'Shrek' and 'Shrek 2', it is still a huge improvement on 'Shrek 3', and provides an emotionally satisfying and enjoyable conclusion to what is a classic animated series. I am glad that it finished on a good note, despite my low expectations."
413,spider-man-3-movie,Kris,2," Topher Grace as ""Venom"" is like Jack Black as ""The Crow"", totally miscast! Guess I'll have to wait for the next ""Batman"" in order to se a great hero film. So long, Spidey, it was good while it lasted."
414,bridesmaids-movie,Smee,3,its way too long and predictable.Here and there some good jokes but its not enough for justify the garbage they feed at .Bunch of clumsy women trying so hard to make jokes but in the end  i felt pity for writers and the actresses 
415,song-of-the-sea-movie,scrimpledimples,1,"First of all, I would like to qualify the rest of this review by first explaining that I enjoy sleepy films about nothing; I'm a massive fan of the films of Bill Forsyth, Wes Anderson, Raymond Briggs and perhaps more appropriate as a comparison here, Sylvain Chomet. I was drawn to this by its aesthetic, and came to it really wanting to enjoy it. The inlay of the DVD box carried the weight of a hundred stars, from a number of respectable publications, but as I only happened upon this by chance in the supermarket and wasn't even aware of it until today, despite its academy award nominations et al. With this in mind, it isn't like I had massive expectations or been subjected to hype it couldn't possibly live up to. The film is indeed visually appealing, as expected, with fluid animation and nicely stylised characters and environments. Unfortunately, and quite unexpectedly, that is where the enjoyment ended. The pacing is atrocious, and the film seems directionless as it meanders to a... conclusion, I... guess? Contrary to what other reviewers have said, I fail to see much in the way of empathy or compassion exhibited in the characters, the 'jealous bratty brother who eventually comes good' is over-done to the point of being largely unlikeable and the few 'touching' scenes seem tokenistic. The Illusionist manages to convey a lot of emotion, character and unspoken back-story in a few on-screen seconds, even without dialogue; and our relationship with the elderly couple of When The Wind Blows are built by their keenly detailed semi-detached bungalow, family photo mantles and the cherry tobacco familiarity of a grandparent. The characters are puddle deep and storytelling in general is vague, and feels largely like Spirited Away rewritten based on Celtic folklore. Using ""largely"" in that last sentence is a lot kinder than the ""blatantly"" I felt it deserved. It feels almost as making the story vague and leaving deliberately large gaps between the lines is not to create healthy ambiguity for your imagination to fill, but a cynical attempt at seeming more interesting than it actually is; creating the illusion that still waters run deep and all that. This film is visually pleasant, but there are a lot of titles out there that manage to be pretty as well as genuinely warm and charming. I really feel that this is being held in higher regard than it should be, perhaps due to a fiercely loyal geographic thing or a desire to support the underdog, which I would usually be all for but this time, sadly not. I fail to see any good in this beyond its visual appeal and I fail to see an audience for this beyond emperor's new clothes hipsters, as it is pretending to be too cryptic for children and it doesn't wear its heart on its sleeve enough for adults."
416,let-me-in-movie,VNVreviewer,3,"Having watched the Swedish original, I was hoping the US version would be less soporific. Unfortunately it's almost exactly the same movie and like the original, still suffers from glacial pacing and an overwhelmingly drab and dreary aesthetic.  It was like watching a feature length, horror version of the opening credits to Coronation Street."
417,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,derpPhysics,0,Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined a Star Wars movie this bad. I can't wait for 2017 to end. A HORRIBLE year.

419,true-grit-movie,Stephmeister02,9,"I enjoyed all the actors in this movie. From Barry Pepper's short cameo and Josh Brolin, to Matt Damon and Jeff Bridges, to the newcomer Hailee Steinfeld, they all took to their roles with talent and dedication. The Coen Brothers made a great looking movie. The only complaint I had was the ending, but otherwise, a spectacular movie."
420,the-immigrant-movie,csw12,1,The Immigrant is nothing more than a horrible soap-opera. The storytelling is clumsy to say the least and the characters are as shallow as a puddle. Its a movie with no point and no direction.
421,war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie,Jalumbi,9,"There is increased social commentary (the wall conspicuosly talks about some of the political climate in current U.S.), great special effects and oscar-worthy performances, specially from Andy Serkis, who perfectly blends humans expressions as well as primate ones. This gives profoundity to Ceasar, as well as the perfect study of its humanity."
422,the-fall-movie,syzygy,0," Pretentious, artsy nonsense;.vacuous and incompetent. The director has a story to work, but little of that is apparent in the script, and worse yet is he doesn't know how to render a dramatic scene. His actors try minimalist expressions to little effect. They try to cry but end up whining. He shooting angles are ridiculously wide and distant because he thinks the inanimate matter will speak where his actors fail to. He can thank his travel agent cum cinematographer for the postcard views."
423,suicide-squad-movie,Adamantium93,3,"It boggles my mind how anyone can see this film and think ""that was a great movie"". For the record, yes, there are fun parts. Ultimately, I didn't feel like my time or money were wasted. But really, this film left me feeling sad. Sad that THIS is the Suicide Squad we got when the talent DC has compiled for this movie could have given us an actually good film. There are good pieces, even a fun moment or two, but the actual construction of this film is a complete mess. I'll start with the good: Viola Davis is perfectly cast as Amadna Waller, Margot Robbie is the BEST part of this film as Harley Quinn, and Will Smith is...well, he's Will Smith. I'm even a fan of Jared Leto's Joker; a version that feels like the Joker without feeling like a ripoff of Hamil, Ledger, or Nicholson, though I do feel like including him here was a mistake (I'll get to that). Most of the rest of the cast just isn't given enough to do. Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, and Adawale Akinnuoye-Agbaje all show promis as Captain Boomerang, El Diablo, and Killer Croc respectively, but they are sidelined for most of the film so we can get more time with Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg. Without wishing to belabour a point, Kinnaman sucks as Rick Flagg. Partially he just can't carry the role, but also the writing for Flagg is atrocious. I wish this was the extent of the film's problems, but that only scratches the surface. The plot is a disjointed, jumbled mess. Some characters are given far too much time to their backstories (Harley) while others are introduced in a sentence or two (Katana) with no explanation for why they are here or what their motivations are. This isn't helped by the inclusion of the Joker scenes (I told you I'd talk about it) which add nothing to the film and only serve to make an already poorly plotted film worse. Seriously, the fact that the Joker, an entirely tangential player who never effects the plot outside of one scene (which is immediately undone), has more to do than Katana, Slipknot, Killer Croc, or Captain Boomerang (all members of the Suicide Squad) is ridiculous. A single scene from the clown at the end would have been sufficient. For what its worth, Batman also overstays his welcome, featuring heavily in both Deadshot and Harley's backstories when the film really doesn't need him there. These, combined with a clunky cameo by the Flash, makes me increasingly worried for WB's rushed attempts at a shared universe a la Marvel. I haven't talked about the bad guys yet because there isn't much to say. Enchantress and Incubus are simply too forgettable to be of any note.  Their mooks are just black blobs in human form - entirely uninteresting as enemies. Its a shame, because Enchantress seems like she could be an interesting villain when we first meet her, being used as a magic slave by Waller, but the film never commits to fleshing her out as a character and so she never moves past the one-note, ""take over the world because magic"" cliche.On the subject of the mooks, here would be a good place to talk about the action scenes, which are generally uninteresting. The enemies are boring in their design, and the film actively avoids having the main characters with the most interesting styles actually use them. Heck, its even a plot point that the one with the coolest powerset (El Diablo) refuses to actually fight for most of the film. When we do see him let loose though, the cgi is too cheesey to take seriously. And we haven't even gotten to the problems this film faces in character arcs and development. Harley is suddenly so attached to the squad because...? Deadshot likes Flagg because...? Flagg trusts the murderers and psychopaths around him enough to remove their leashes because...? The final act starts too early and drags on through too much boredom and unwieldy tonal shifts to be consistently entertaining. From the get go, every ""twist"" is painfully obvious or even outright explained before the twist actually comes. You will know immediately who will become the villain, who will die early to show that Waller doesn't mess around (hint: its the one who the movie forgets to introduce), who will sacrifice themselves heroically in the end, and who will ultimately turn out to be the ""good guy"" of the villainous squad. Is this film an utter waste of time? If you like Harley Quinn or are ok with watching the movie for a handful of good scenes and largely sleeping for the rest of it, than go ahead. Like I said, there are enjoyable pieces. Just don't expect a good film, or even a coherent film."
424,shutter-island-movie,BradySmith,3,"An infuriating movie.  One which uses expert direction to tell a story with no solid ground.  It's weird and twisty and atmospheric but never in any way which is remotely good.  It will keep you guessing, sure, but it pulls such a non-ending, such a copout that you could never really be sure to what exactly just happened.  Other movies have pulled off the ambiguous ending without it becoming a copout, but this one doesn't know how.  Inception did it.  In fact it did it in a way which was significant and beautiful, but Shutter Island is just a loopy trip into insanity which goes nowhere truly scary but everywhere and anywhere disturbing just to put a bad taste in your mouth when it's over.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this expensive piece of garbage."

426,monsters-university-movie,SirSX3,8,"I waited 12 years for a sequel to Monsters Inc., (I was looking forward to Boo reuniting with the duo) but we got a prequel instead. Regardless, I enjoyed it.This movie focus more on Mike Wazowski, unlike the previous installment, which mostly focus on Sullivan. The best part of the film is the opening and the ending; the main portion of the film is alright, but the start and the end is great.Despite being a follow-up, this film feels like it's its own movie. (instead of trying too hard to make it similar to the original) Has room for improvement, but great time regardless. 4 out of 5 stars."
427,pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides-movie,wareagle12,3,How could you be so heartless- Kanye WestThis movie came from an original movie that was completely based on adventure and heart.  The main characters found themselves in daring adventures that thrilled the audience but the only reason we cared so much was because we actually cared about the characters.  In this movie its the same formula as the original but its all put up just to make a movie.  The characters have no depth despite them trying to create fake depth.  It seems like any summer movie put out to make a few million dollars.
428,the-last-kiss-movie,RG,3," The smartest film?? voice of our generation??? wait wait this is paul haggis the king of conveniet writing, he ll put in more intersting characters that are not major parts in the movie (izzy, chris) to conveniently make it into a story that we can all see coming(chris running into jenna). ""no surprises"" complains braff and uses it as excuse to go out with the brunette. this movie had nothing new, far from any surprises, some really cleched lines delivered by some promising actors, and some really convenient music (coldplay - warning sign when braffs out on the poarch). choreography is sharp but it just tries soo hard to be an indie movie and it fails terribly."
429,phantom-thread-movie,hellacritical,3,"This film could easily be misconstrued as a comedy. The lines were so stiff and unnatural that they became humorous. There is also way too much staring. I'm pretty sure about an hour and 5 minutes of the movie could have been shaved off if the characters just stopped staring at each other and pausing before they spoke. Don't get me wrong, that can be sometimes powerful, but it was not at all utilized correctly in this film. It doesn't work when literally every character does it.The whole film is a demonstration of insanely toxic masculinity. For some reason, Vicky Krieps' character, Alma, finds this insanely attractive. It isn't until she meets Daniel Day-Lewis' character that she starts to feel good about herself. It's insanely offensive, and she is definitely no one's feminist role model. The fact that people are calling this a ""love story"" is disgusting.None of the characters were likable so I found the whole thing quite boring. It is difficult to pinpoint what parts I hated exactly, because they were all equally forgettable. Paul Thomas Anderson's characters had no personalities whatsoever. They were ""quirky"" and ""strange,"" but that's not a personality.I understand that this is supposed to be a haunting, semi-psychopathic film, but the way to really make that work is to make it as close to real-life as possible. Making it seem like it could happen in real life makes it truly scary. However, this did not seem like real life to me, because everything was just so flat. The dialogue was unnatural and disappointing.The two reasons that I'm giving this even a 3 is because the cinematography and the costume design was beautiful. I really wish that more was done with the clothing aspect. The story had so much potential, and I kept thinking of ways that the movie could have been so much better, but alas, PTA did not take that route.Overall, incredibly disappointing. Because of the poor quality of this film, I hope this isn't actually Daniel Day-Lewis' final film, for his sake."

431,the-green-hornet-movie,Rumblebeelove,9,"Seth Rogan and Jay Chou have an almost bromance going on here as The Green Hornet and Kato. They honestly have a very nice chemistry going on, as well as some very well thought out choreography. I do love the fact that while Kato is all sorts of bad ass, poor Brett only seems to get by. Seth Rogan plays his part well and is a loveable, but still sort of a ass. 3D was very well done, and the effects were pleasing while not taking away from the actors themselves. I would have liked to see a decked out Christoph Waltz with a full villan persona, but he is delightful as the akward gang lord. This one is fun and is worth the 3D price!"
432,transformers-dark-of-the-moon-movie,FreedomFighters,3,"I must be in the minority here, but I personally found ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" to be the worst of the first three Michael Bay ""Transformers"" films. Sure, it's visually brilliant and has some pretty great music, but all things considered, the film is pretty poorly-written, awfully acted, overly long, and worst of all, BORING! ""Dark of the Moon"" actually threatened to bore me to sleep. A movie about giant, fighting robots shouldn't make me want to fall asleep. All in all, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" is not a very fun ride, and unless you're a hardcore ""Transformers"" fan that enjoyed the previous two films, you won't find much to like here."

Maybe this movie is o.k. for the target audience... 2 points for the time-consuming set-design. designideas and setting could be a good videogame!

436,king-kong-movie,RichardE.,0, I'm truly amazed. I really am? I read things like the story was so touching? Have any of you ever seen the original made back in 1933? What in the world was original about this bombastic sorry excuse for a motion picture? The acting was simply awful. The directing was some of the worst I have ever seen. And the dialogue was awful too and made no sense. Add to this the film being about twice as long as it should and it all adds up to one big mess. The story of Beauty and the Beast has been told many times. Peter Jackson has not done anything worthy of two hundred million dollars of wasted money. This is as bad a film that I have seen in a long long time. The movie isn't even out two weeks and the theaters are half full. It is a disaster at the box office despite the hoopla by idiots who act as if this is an original idea.
437,the-assassination-of-jesse-james-by-the-coward-robert-ford-movie,PeterD.,3," I've never seen so many people walk out of the cinema before. A very boring movie with overlong stretched scenes, trying to evoke emotions where there are none. Yes, some nice shots and yes, you get an good idea what it must have been like to live in those desolate times. But mumbling dialogs, too heavily accented, I cannot understand halve the time. I wouldn't recommend it!"
438,pompeii-movie,punksoulY,0,"This movie is a total waste of time. No character development no nothing. I mean there is this small child in Britain, seeing how his parents are slaughtered and killed by romans, getting caught by sort of mercenaries or whatever the  they were, becoming a gladiator, killing everyone who is in his way over 17 years in London. After being recognized by a fat roman who wants him for his shows, getting him to italy where he gets to know a rich pompeiian girl on the way to pompeii, who falls in love with him, because he killed a horse with his bare hands. Being stuck in a cell with a black gladiator who just has the opportunity to get free after his last fight against the main character, realizing that the black guy Atticus is a formidable man having the same thoughts about romans... recognizing that the romans who killed his family 17 years ago are also in pompei, while the parents of the girl want to make business with the roman guy who killed the mom or the main character ""Milo"". Afterwards typical, i cannot reach the ""bad"" guy I have to kill countless statists in a fight in the collosseum, being rescued by the gutts of the girl who gets locked away.... Having to fight against the bad bad romans... Blubb Ahh yeah there was a volcano... Piuu piuuu bad CGI, bad VFX bad everything... First there is an earthquake destroying the collosseum... Then a fight as usual in the ruins... Running away from the volcano.... Ahhh there was this girl.... Locked away just 2 Minutes before the volcano broke out... 15 km away from the collosseum... WTF??? - Milo escapes with Atticus.. Atticus wants to run to the habour... Panicing people, booom tsss. typical cliché effects alla Dantes Peak, Volcano, or Armageddon - I have seen everything before in other movies... Total predictable development. Then Milo runs in 30 seconds 15 km to the place where the girl is locked... rescues her, brings her back to the city... Then the habour is flooded by a tsunami, which is stopped by the Citywall....... .omfg.... Atticus, Girl and Milo try to find a way out... They meet the romans again... Girl gets kidnapped. Milo and atticus have to fight a bunch of romans.... Atticus fights against the ultrastrong roman... Atticus gets lethally injured but killes the roman.... Milo tries to follow the kidnapped girl on a horse which definetly has gps, because it can avoid any sort of impact, rock, fire, dust etc.... Car of the bad guy crushes.... girl gets sort of rescued... Stupid fight between milo and Kiefer Sutherland ( Bad Guy)  result - Girl locks arm of bad guy with handcuffs... Milo is not getting his revenge .... "" My gods are coming after you"" - BOOOOORING .... Big Lava wave comes, which is at least 600 mph fast. Bad Guy Burns.... Atticus Burns as a free man .... The couple burns .... END ..... I recommend anybody who wants to see a movie with a plot to not watch this film. It is an absolute waste of time... I felt like i wasted 106 minutes of my life after finishing this movie, cause it is giving you absolutely nothing. The characters are totally flat, the story is already clear ( Pompeii falls) and the Main Story of Milo is absolutely pointless... He gets no revenge, he gets no friends, he gets no girl, he gets no life as a free man... I asked myself at the end... If I am able to run about 15 km in 30 seconds, I would at least have had the time to escape to Vienna with my ""girl"" to suisse germany or even denmark... Nooo .... I choose to die in the flames.... By telling the ""girl"" just look at me... while i burn to death.... This movie is absolute crap... Sorry.... If you want to see an entertaining movie, where you don't feel like you wasted valuable lifetime... Don't even think about watching this waste of money movie with a story which could've been more interesting if apes wrote it."

At DC they must have been drunk to release this piece of junk. First of all the screenplay is so badly written, my 4 years old niece could have done a better job. It seems like they have no other option than showing the death of BruceWayne's parents again and again. Every time slightly different. And him falling into the damn pit. All the great work they did with the Dark Knight trilogy has vanished! Gone forever. Forgotten. I was wishing they were planning to add some interesting facets to Superman and Wonder Woman, to save them (and me) from the clichés they are, but no. They threw Batman too in a mud of superficial plot, where everythinghappens for no (or stupid) reasons. Ben Affleck already killed Daredevil. Now he'll be wrecking with his inexpressive mask the next generation of Batman movies too! Guys, you just took my enthusiasm forDC's upcoming movies away."

With a very well done romantic element and very good musical numbers, Moulin Rouge! avoids the traps that many ""musicals"" fall into and it makes all of the songs incredibly enjoyable, rather than leaving them with a feeling of being out of place and just unnecessary. Here, the songs are over the top as expected, but always enjoyable and always seemed to provide the most magical of movie moments found in this one. Ewan McGregor is great here (if what I saw online is true and he did do all of his singing, then wow am I impressed, he has an amazing voice), Nicole Kidman is very good too, as is John Leguizamo and the rest of the cast. This one is Baz Luhrmann at his very best and it shows."
447,skyfall-movie,LaGuerta,3,"The progress made in bringing the franchise into the modern age is spectacularly undone.

448,gravity-movie,mrnice,8,"Of course it's well made, but one of the great triumphs of Gravity is that it is a non-violent, scientific and enlightening action drama. I challenge you to find an equally exciting, bombastic movie with as much love for humanity's abilities."
449,monsters-movie,Unkindness,7,"An excellent idea for a film and one that was executed well enough, especially on a fifteen thousand dollar budget. To many people went into this with a closed mind expecting another Aliens or Independence Day knock off and instead they got a thoughtful, deep film with decent acting and amazing homegrown effects. That isn't to say it's without flaws. The monster design is a little unimaginative though they aren't Cthulhu either, simple floating octopi. Cthulhu had arms and legs people and large wings. Also a bloated stomach. Actually read the Lovecraft stories.The ending is bleak which in this case I thought was an excellent way to finish it. The overall tone of the film is hopeful and that counter balanced what could have just become a mediocre boy meets girl in the midst of an alien invasion plot. Definitely a decent way to spend an hour and a half however only if you have a modicum of open mindedness and can actually appreciate an indie film trying to do something more and accomplishing it, more or less."

If this movie had been exactly the same, but a different director's name slapped on it, people would call this movie terrible. Since Tarantino's name is attached, however, people are somehow calling this film brilliant. The only purpose this film MIGHT have had was to offend, and that could have been accomplished by showing police footage of old people being murdered, though with the crowd that raved about this movie I wouldn't be surprised if they'd also find that riveting. Don't get me wrong, the acting was absolutely wonderful, but that can't save every movie. That's like giving a toddler incredibly expensive paint and then watching him drink it then puke it all over a perfectly good canvas. I will admit it's fun to watch people rave about how this film was a masterpiece because it's as if people are trying REALLY hard to grasp a turd and then tote it around like it's gold, all the while looking down at us and telling us we're just too unsophisticated to understand why it's a beautiful thing."

For example De Niro discovers that the Arab doesn't understand the arab language and there is no consequence?If it is based on a true story I would like to know exactly what happened to see if the erratic behavior of many characters really took place.The acting is OK, except for the poor appearence of De Niro  but this doesn't seem enough to me to rehabilitate the story and the movie overallRoberto BelleiRome Italy"
459,the-ridiculous-6-movie,moviemitch96,2,"Well the title certainly does the film justice. Yes Adam Sandler has made much worse films in the past, but this is also easily up there with some of his most idiotic attempts. First off, don't even get me started on his pathetic attempt to sound ""cool"" with that deep and raspy voice of his the whole film. As for the rest of the film in general, with the exception of a slight chuckle or two, I found myself cringing and shaking my head in disbelief at almost every pathetic attempt at a joke or one-liner. I should've known better with it being a Sandler film that every other joke would be a fart or poop joke. And much like the characters, the whole film also felt jumbled and confused as to what direction it wanted to go in or what its intention was, especially towards the end, which by then made the film feel even more pointless. Overall, if you don't mind killing two hours of your life (along with some precious brain cells), then don't hesitate. Otherwise, I'd steer clear of this one. Surely Netflix can do better. They've usually offered much better original content than this."
460,contagion-movie,scrieciu,7,"By the look of the cast, the story, the suspense, I couldn't wait to see this movie. Well, I expected a little bit more, but in general it's good. I felt like they should of have showed more at specific parts. So  '' Contagion '' is a realistic movie about a virus that's spreading around the world. The film barely started and it already brought you into it, which was the way it supposed to be. If you like psychological thrillers, then you will enjoy it. The acting was solid. I mean, come on, you know it will be strong on the acting with this kind of cast (Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet, etc). But, I founded useless that well known actors had such small roles. For example, Gwyneth Paltrow barely played in the film, and her part could have been played by anyone. For some odd reason, this movie reminds me of '' The Social Network ''. Yeah, yeah, I know their totally different movies. But it had the similar cinematography, with similar ambiance (expect that '' Contagion '' had a serious problem) and the '' cutting '' from scene to scene. It's the kind of movie with high expectation and fans who are hyped for this, but it's not that big of a deal. Yes it was good, but it could have been a little bit better, the characters should have been more developed and could have been more '' completed ''."
461,knowing-movie,WilliamW.,1," I give this a 1 for almost keeping me interested at the start, but it very quickly turns into one of the dumbest big budget films played with a straight face I've ever seen. SPOILER ALERT - if higher beings know the future, can travel through space, etc, then why choose all this weird ambiguous whispering and symbolic nonesense to get people to do as they're told. It makes less than no sense. Plot wise this is complete drivel, only some ok CGI saves about five minutes of this movie. Cage is terrible, mostly because his lines are so stupid, at times he actually explains plot points out loud as if the audience were as dim witted as the writers. Avoid."

467,mona-lisa-smile-movie,FilipeNeto,7,"Art overcoming mental barriers.This film tells the story of a young teacher of art history who teaches in an ultraconservative female private school. Through their ideas, she will discuss the school's rigid moral and the rules of the society of fifties, managing to earn the respect of his colleagues and the affection of the students. Directed by Mike Newell, this movie features Julia Roberts as the protagonist and Kirsten Dunst in the role of a conservative student, who will lead the opposition to the modern ideas concerning women.This film could be just another film about the private schools of American rich kids if it were three important factors that make the difference: the first is the good performance of Julia Roberts, even better than in other more acclaimed films; the second is the song ""The Heart of Every Girl"" composed by Sir Elton John purposely for the film and winner of a Golden Globe; the third is the screenplay, very well written and directed, focusing not only in the change of mind of the students but also in the drastic change of the role of women during the twentieth century.Despite the positive notes, this movie has two serious defects. The first is that it is too similar to the movie ""Dead Poets Society"". So similar that all those who watch this film without paying attention will think it is just a female version of the film starring Robin Williams. The second flaw in this movie is too much focus on the fights between girls, which only served to lighten the film and remove maturity to the plot. Maybe it was because of these small defects that the film never reached a higher level of recognition and reputation: contrary to ""The Dead Poets Club"" (comparisons are inevitable), this film didn't received major awards or nominations. Nevertheless, it's truly remarkable and deserves place in the living room of any lover of good cinema."
468,orphan-movie,talisencrw,8,"This was a very entertaining, enjoyable and well-made horror film. In saying that, there WERE three distinct flaws that came to mind: One, I'm not sure a marriage THAT troubled would be allowed to adopt a child; two, I don't see how ANYONE as intelligent as that pair are proposed to be would ever adopt anyone without having the necessary background information; and three, being a parent myself, there's no way on God's green earth that I would have continued the social experiment of the orphan's adoption the very first moment that something bizarre happened, or that things went awry. Keeping my aforementioned small problems with the film's plot problems in mind, I still greatly enjoyed the film and it was highly enjoyable throughout. I particularly enjoyed the troubled artwork of the orphan in question (shown in neon, only when ultraviolet light was presented)."
469,the-big-hit-movie,tonybob,2, Ehhhh this movie was not good. the action sequences were alright marky mark was jumping all over the place. the acting was horrible as well and the writting was s..t. its good if u like stupid movies that are unrealistic and have bad dialouge and a few shoot outs then this is for you unfortunatly it was not for me.
470,evil-dead-ii-movie,Spider1775,10,"Evil Dead II is proof that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were the gods of low budget filmmaking, proof of the incredible intelligence and stupidity of the horror genre. Evil Dead II is among the best horror comedies ever made. No much needs to be said from Raimi's spot on direction and Campbell's iconic, ridiculous parody of the action hero, Evil Dead II combines ludicrous amounts of gore with ludicrous amounts of hilarity, what more could you need?"

473,groundhog-day-movie,Compi24,10,"Harold Ramis' ""Groundhog Day"" is not only a worthy addition to Bill Murray's stellar repertoire, an unendingly hilarious comedy, an uncommonly sweet narrative, or a truly compelling thematic adventure. It's a monumentally significant addition to cinema as a whole."
474,ricki-and-the-flash-movie,LamontRaymond,8,"I had seen the trailer maybe 10 times and knew I'd see it, even if just to laugh at it.  But it's sneaky good!  Seems like it would be this forced, saccharine thing, but it doesn't pull punches, Meryl Streep is solid, and Rick Springfield is outSTANDing.  He needs more big roles to go along with these supporting parts.  This movie feels like it could have been the pilot for a Parenthood kind of series, but I think it makes some great choices."
475,the-space-between-us-movie,NightReviews,3,"“What is your favourite thing about Earth?”It may be such a simple yet overwhelming question, considering all the wonderful things that make up our world and each and every little thing that makes up all the good in all our individual lives. Yet one of my favourite slogans so far of 2017 is one that asks very deep and a heavy emotional response.Sadly, the slogan seems to be one of the very few deep parts that comprise director Peter Chelsom’s newest inspirational film The Space Between Us. The UK director seems to be on some sort of positive cinema boost, given his last film Hector and the Search for Happiness is a parabolic film about one doctor’s real life pursuit of life’s greatest gift.Sadly, with The Space Between Us, Chelsom’s handle on science fiction is very scarce, even though space accounts for a very small portion of his newest film. The Space Between Us is a love story through and through. Dabbling with elements of the who-dun-it narrative, as well as the coming of age story arc, Space is a modestly budgeted film with some great ambition that really doesn’t live up to the hype and one film that has its gaze far beyond the horizon. Think of it as a film that promises finding the gold at the end of the rainbow, only to really deliver Skittles, I mean, if Skittles are your thing.The cosmic love story begins well before either of our love birds began their courting, nearly two decades before, when a young and ambitious astronaut, Sarah Elliot (Janet Montgomery) and her crew, become the first group of individuals to colonize and inhabit Mars for four years. Placed in the care of their precarious and idealist leader and founder, Nathaniel Shepard (Gary Oldman), Nathaniel’s Genesis program partners with NASA to deliver Sarah and her sacrificial crew to the unknown planet of Mars. Given that all the numbers, scenarios and outcomes were already pre-planned, the one situation no one anticipated, was Sarah pregnancy. Giving birth and losing her life before she makes it to Mars, the Genesis program agrees to make the child’s birth a complete classified secret. Luckily, Gardner Elliot (Asa Butterfield) makes it safely to Mars, as we flash forward to Gardner’s adolescents. It is in Mars that Gardner grows up, interacting with the brightest scientists from NASA, who continue to occupy Mars, practically and implicitly contributing to Gardner upbringing, Gardner lacks many average teenage characteristics, despite his closest maternal relationship on the spaceship to botanist Kendra Wyndham (Carla Gugino). Gardner’s intellect is established quite early on, showing off how book smart and scientifically minded the youngster really is.Bored with nothing but causing chaos aboard the station, Gardner uses his smarts to trick everything and everyone on Mars. Learning of his secrecy to Earth early on, Gardner begins using the Wi-Fi (yup, they have internet in Mars) to make new friends on Earth. Concealing his true identity and current situation to an online friend and potential love interest Tulsa (Britt Robertson), the two spark a friendship that originated on an Orphan based online chat room. As the two orphans begin developing a closer relationship thanks to futuristic FaceTiming and instant messaging to one another, it becomes quite clear that Gardner is ready to finally venture to Earth, despite his physical boundaries and various health issues, including his oversized space heart, brittle bones, his foreignness to gravity and his very poor human social skills.While Gardner’s time spent on Mars is very limited, his caregiver and closest friend Kendra, begins campaigning for Gardner’s request to visit Earth, not only to finally see Tulsa, but to find out the identity of his father. Half way across the Universe, once on Earth, Gardner surprises Tulsa at school, where the two team up and break many laws in search of Gardner’s father. While discovering America, Gardner falls in love with Tulsa, and the two love birds steal their way to Arizona where they embark on an adventure that involves the Grand Canyon, hot air balloons and some pretty romantic locales.Sadly, Space is a project that has been in development for quite some time, having Asa attached since before he was casted as Ender Wiggin in the sci-fi Ender’s Game. While many cast and crew moved on, Asa remained attached with the project until it was green lit, with Robertson as his Tulsa. Unfortunately, while Robertson and Butterfield continue to prove their strong acting skills on screen, the two never really convince audiences of their love story and romance, sharing an almost big sister/little brother type relationship instead."

It try so hard to seem as if it doesn't need to try. It try so hard to prove how funny it can be under the unusual circumstances of not wanting to be funny. There is absolutely nothing relatable about these characters- and the only people who can relate wouldn't dare want to. Page as the smartass teenage, Church as the goofball, and Quaid as the uptight father- how groundbreaking. I suppose there are worse movies, if you dig deep, but do not see this movie. Don't waste your time. It seems like 5 hours of hell. Except there is not the enjoyable experience of watching it fall and crumble like some films. It just simply never stood up. ...make that 5 hours of purgatory."

Dubbed Task Force X, the criminals unite to battle a mysterious and powerful entity, while the diabolical Joker (Jared Leto) launches an evil agenda of his own."
482,walk-the-line-movie,LaunceR.,7," Joaquin and Reese are very good in this biopic, which follows the genre's standard form too closely. The movie manages to stay very close to the narrative established in a couple of Cash's biographies; the exception, however, would be in the story of Cash's own family and friends. While we see Cash's father and mother, his surviving sibling and friends -- who apparently played very central roles in drying out the drugged up and drunken pop star -- are missing. Also, I fault the film for largely ignoring the important role of Cash's Christianity in his recovery and his art. Cash was a progressive evangelical, a species of Christian that has almost vanished from the public arena in the United States today. I wish more on that had been included. Still, not the worst waste of celluloid in this otherwise desolate holiday season."

485,the-girl-with-all-the-gifts-movie,StrongHarm,0,"This movie comes from a very disturbed mind.. and not in a good way.  It celebrates sympathy for the devil.  Zombies are to be empathized with, and people are the monsters.  Zombies are nothing more than the earth's ecology taking over the planet, as is right and proper.  If you're a liberal you're going to love this one!  Why bring politics into this you might say?  Because to minds like the one who conceived of this horrible film, politics is not about management of the society, it's a quest to display the more altruism than the next person.  This movie takes altruism, to the extent of rebellion against mankind itself.. in favor of nature, to a disturbing level.  I hope historians of the future view this movie as a good example of the mass insanity which plagued our age.. or perhaps like in the movie, a new species will reign that actually views this insanity as appealing.  If you're someone who believes in relocating ISIS to sanctuary cities, and that failure of the economy is justified in the name of fighting climate change, you're really going to love this movie."

An insult to anyone who is a true fan of the Max Payne series. Also, an insult to anyone who actually paid money to see it. Avoid this movie like the plague."
487,cloud-atlas-movie,theahsanhaseeb,9,"A three-hour investment to watch a film that has generated ridiculously bad reviews from most of the major critics is such a risky decision especially when the film has also failed at the box-office meaning that not even the audiences have liked the film. BUT! Cloud Atlas is much more than that. This is not a child's play to incorporate six different storylines in a single film especially when they all are so complex and their interrelation seems nearly impossible at times. Hats off to the Wachowski Brothers and Tom Tykwer for their tremendous effort by making a film whose novel is already complicated but the way they have executed the entire film is marvelous. I don't have words to describe how impressed I am with their work on this film, it is utterly excellent. Honestly, at first, the film seemed like a disappointment to me, I was trying so hard to figure out what does all of it mean which was preventing me from the main purpose i.e. enjoying the film. But gradually, throughout these three hours, I started understanding what is going on and it finally started making a LITTLE sense. Of course, everyone has their own interpretations about the film but the real and common one is that ""everything is connected, your past may affect your present as well as your future."" This can be thought of like that every individual's actions in a particular storyline affects the actions of other individuals in the different storylines. It can be seen like a phase in a human life, in which a person is bad at first, then he realizes that he is doing wrong and then in the end, he finally stands up for what is right. But this explanation doesn't fit all the individuals' stories like Hugo Weaving, he is evil in all of the storylines and maybe it's because his soul never realizes that it is doing wrong. Neither does it fit Tom Hanks' stories because he is a bad, greedy guy in the first storyline and then he becomes a good person and after that he becomes a bad person again and then finally, in the last stoyline, he becomes a good person, which doesn't make any sense. The more you try to figure out the plot of the film and interpret it in different ways, the more you start finding different explanations of how it could be possible. The film's brilliant (and far more complicated than I first thought) storyline is supported by phenomenal performances by the entire cast members. Every single one of them has played his/her roles wonderfully and that is also supported by the factor of beautiful make-up and styling to completely adapt them in their respective roles in different storylines. It completely blows you away, you can't even recognize that there are the same individuals in all of the storylines. Visual effects are great and so is the cinematography. Screenplay is really clever, because I have been reading that it varies from the novel and inverts the ending of all the storylines and it still has been incorporated properly and doesn't seem wrong. I might not read the novel because if I do, I'd be confused again and I don't want that. This is really not an all-audiences film, most of the people are not liking it because of the complications in the storylines and the confusing narrative but what it actually demands is your complete concentration because without it, you cannot understand what the real message and the purpose of this film really is, what exactly are the Wachowski Brothers trying to deliver to us, why did they choose to make this movie. All of the questions are answered if you watch the movie with complete attention and remember everything from the beginning until the end, it is really important. Cloud Atlas is easily one of the most complicated and daring films I have ever watched in my life. From the rough idea, you can guess that it would fail miserably but the Wachowski Brothers still made it for us because it is necessary to remind everyone what the real power of filmmaking is!"
488,the-day-the-earth-stood-still-movie,StuJ,2, Cannot believe how bad this is. The interrelationship between the robot and Klatu never explained? The day everything stood still?? The famous line we all ran around saying to each other as kids? eeves was well cast -- a part requiring no acting fits him ever so well. A massive demonstration of Hollywood bungling. Special effects do not a movie make. I need to rewatch the original to purge any memory of this from my mind.

If you are the son of an Irish-Catholic police officer with low moral fortitude and a love for slow motion acrobatics, this movie is for you. For everyone else, this movie is a overlong mess of awful acting, sophomoric philosophy, and meaningless religious overtones. Do yourself a favor and go to a Catholic mass instead of going to see this: it will be just as long, boring, and painful but at least it's free."

Save for a few moments when Lawrence goes off on people when her entire world is threatened, it's not dramatic, it's not funny, and it'sunwatchable.  The entire story is narrated by her alleged grandmother, which makes for the most boring and tedious exposition imaginable.

493,learning-to-drive-movie,GangKutti,8,"Isabel Coixet's light hearted, soulfully intimate low-key comedy drama is a lovely excursion. Wendy(Patricia Clarkson) is a sharp-tongued book critic, struggling to take control of her life, as her husband walks out of their 21 year old marital life for a younger woman. Her only daughter is off at Vermont. Darwan(Ben Kingsley) is a cab driver and driving instructor, who has a calm dignifying character underneath his authoritative exterior. He is proud of his U.S citizenship as well as his cultural heritage. Darwan is potrayed as an honest, hard-working sikh immigrant from India. Having never been behind the wheels, Wendy decides to get her driver's license and take control of her life. The clash of personalities lead to scenes of comic tension and witty comedy. Wendy is dumbstruck and tries to understand how Darwan's marriage with Jasleen, a woman he never met before works. The plot also takes time to show the struggles of Jasleen(Sarita Choudhary) to adapt to a new country and husband who is struggling to express his emotions. As the platonic friendship between the culturally diverse lead duo develops, they help each other to move forward with their lives. ""The driver's biggest problem is everyone else. You cant always trust people to behave properly"" says Darwan. Ain't that true in real life as well? Learning to Drive takes its time developing characters, which is its major strength. Its a very warm and straight-forward movie with very like-able characters and a wonderful perspective of human behavior."

495,the-hateful-eight-movie,TheQuietGamer,8,"It's a mystery-comedy in a western setting in which it appears the director is trying to say something about racism in America, but never actually manages to say anything at all. Oh well, at least we get a funny whodunit kind of like one you would get at one of those mystery dinner theatres. You know, outside of the gore, profanity, and racism. While Tarantino never manages to get a point across about race relations despite what appears to be his best efforts, the gory murder-mystery that forms later in the movie and outright weirdness off the characters and their interactions up until that point keep things interesting throughout. It can be laugh-out-loud funny at times. Only in a dark, ""I might have a sick sense of humor"" sort of way. There's some sharp dialog and naturally goofy characters to add this sense of comedy to an otherwise bleak and gross film. The things the director has become well-known for such as excessive gore, unique visuals, and originality are all present throughout. Perhaps even to the point that he is indulging in what could be described as his fetishes. It's certainly a very unique movie. Not revolutionary in the same way Pulp Fiction was, but I still can't recall seeing anything like this before. Tarantino's latest effort succeeds thank to the fact that it is very much a Tarantino film. It's bloody, funny, and as hateful as the title implies. It's a shame all he manages to end up saying about racism is ""hey, there was a time where white people used to openly use the n-word a lot and black people weren't happy about slavery so after the civil war they did stuff to get revenge on confederates. Also, I'm pretty sure neither were that thrilled about Mexicans. Somehow this is all ties back into racism today."" It would've been interesting to see if the director has/had any profound thoughts or insights on the topic of modern racism. Regardless, the movie succeeds in it's humor and mystery. That's plenty of reason for me to recommend it."

497,going-in-style-movie,Qgal5kap,1,"Cringe fest as a term has seldom found a better mate. Going in style is a boring movie, which reflects the production line mentality that has become Hollywood. It was one long predictable picture, with the faces of actors we all love. This will undoubtedly satisfy certain people, and as such, it will probably even meet it's projected sales goals. This is the problem with so many goods and services these days. Even mediocrity sells, and there is nothing we can do to change it."

499,warcraft-movie,Daveman,7,"The movie has some flaws, but is still a rather good and enjoyable movie. And for a movie adaptation of a video game, that alone is an achievement. The most enjoyable parts of the movie are the scenery, combat, and the sense of world building as if this movie is a stepping stone for something much bigger. Durotan and Khadgar are both enjoyable characters. The downsides include Lothar and Llane's unenthusiastic acting, the somewhat forced romance, and a certain ""death scene"" that should be emotional, but doesn't really hit the right notes. Also, the movie could afford to be a little longer to fill in some important details, like the Orc's history before Gul'dan's corruption, as well as explaining who the Draenei are (the blue people sacrificed early in the movie). Overall, still enjoyable and worth watching from an outsider's perspective. If you're a Warcraft or Blizzard fan, I doubt you'll need any other reason to watch it."

501,hannibal-movie,FranzHcritic,3,"I always thought the Hannibal Lecter films were a bit exaggerated. But this film lacks any of the suspense of 'Silence' (which I also thought was overplayed) and is unnecessarily gruesome.  The death scenes were violent purely for the sake of it, and the acting was bordering on hammy. I can't say much of this film. This is still an overrated film, even thought it already gave others mixed signals."
502,pineapple-express-movie,ChrisM.,2," As a judd apatow fan, I was thoroughly disappointed. I found my eyes shutting more than I was laughing as I wondered how a team that created so many hit comedies in the past years could miss so bad. Seth Rogen was more irritating than funny as an occasionally chuckle-inducing supporting cast in Franco and whoever played Red weren't enough to save this film from a poor-man's Dumb&amp;Dumber plot, terrible writing and overall lack of comedic timing. The writers who are raving over this movie must have been...well.....high."

But, like the characters forced by the game to do things they otherwise wouldn't Ross and his team work within the PG-13 constraints to make a good action movie that still is about kids killing kids for sport. Lawrence is simply stunning in the lead role, and the orbiting characters are all top notch (Special kudos to Lenny Kravitz are in order). Sadly, the boys of HG are almost pointless, and Peeta is completely clueless to boot. In the end it is riveting and enjoyable too, but I cannot help but think what this could be in a world where an R rated HG could get made by Chris Nolan. That would be something that would satisfy a real hunger."
505,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,CreepyMcCheese,0,"I have been a fan of Star Wars for as long as I can remember.  Every Star Wars film, including the prequels, has had moments that gave me goosebumps, the feeling I would always use to measure how a film made me feel.  I had no such goosebump moment in The Last Jedi.  The best word I can use to describe my experience is contempt.  From very near the start of the movie, I felt an ever deepening pit forming in the bottom of my stomach.  So much life is wasted in this film, heroic moments are ruined by modern sounding one liners or gestures.  Luke might as well have dabbed in that scene near the end when the director wanted him to look like a badass.  Why has the technology of Star Wars degraded so much and become so inconsistent?  Sure, the sound and visuals were great, and the music was awesome as always thanks to John Williams, but most movies look and sound great today so that is no longer the mark of a good film.  This film has no heart, no soul, or care for what came before."
506,district-9-movie,EvinC,8, This film was just so passionate. I never thought I'd hear myself even saying something like that. There have only been few sci-fi movies that have ever impressed me and this is definitely one of them. It's definitely better than most of this summer's bull.

508,her-movie,Axgrinder,9,"‘Her’ is one of those movies that got snubbed by the 2014 Oscar nominating committee.  The first thought I had after seeing the movie was, “How did Spike Jonze ever think something like that up!”  The material is incredibly original, and it probably should have received a nomination for best original screenplay.  The movie is also well cast. The acting by Joaquin Phoenix is first rate.  It’s too bad he doesn’t seem to be well liked by the Hollywood crowd.  While I’m not a huge Scarlett Johansson fan, she is quite credible and does an excellent job of expressing emotion as a disembodied voice.  Having recently seen American Hustle I had a hard time getting used to the rather timid character portrayed by Amy Adams.  Though I’m not sure you would call ‘Her’ Best Picture material, it’s a far better movie than Wolf of Wall Street. That being said, this movie is not for everyone.  It’s definitely different, but has the potential to become something of a cult classic.  (Think ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’, with a more conventional ending).  The movie is set in the near future, but the future is a bit of a sterile, lonely and nerdy place.  People are hesitant.  They don’t interact with each other well, and when they do, their conversations are awkward and their behavior is forced.  (Some reviewers seem to mistake this for bad acting.)  Fashion has also taken a turn for the worse, as people in the future dress badly (especially the men who seem to favor really high-waisted pants). Although the basic premise of the movie “Lonely man falls in love with the voice on his operating system” sounds a bit creepy, and might have been if Jonze hadn’t done such an excellent job, the movie really isn’t the least bit so.  The ‘sex’ in this movie is of a variety that is intended to make you a bit uncomfortable.  There is only a brief bit of traditional (gratuitous?) female nudity, and no traditional action scenes, which again may discourage the average viewer. But, if you are still reading this, then don’t be discouraged about seeing it, it’s a terrific movie.  It’s a story about loneliness.  It’s about the basic need for companionship, the struggle to fulfill that need, and the mistakes we make along the way.  If you’re open to that kind of story, then I highly recommend this movie."
509,rush-movie,RevRon,10,The only racing I get interested in usually involves the words “kart” and “Mario” but I was shocked by how much I enjoyed “Rush.”  The story about Hunt’s and Lauda’s rivalry during the 1976 Formula 1 racing season is interesting enough but the performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl are just impossibly good.  Add that with fantastic visual and heart-pounding race sequences and the film ended up being far better than I thought it could have been.

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is bursting with warmth, inspiration, love, and the passion for pure adventure. Truly spectacular. The music, cinematography, plot, and dialogue are spot on.

513,the-boys-are-back-movie,Allan,9," Mostly both moving and fun. The movie makes clear that Owen's character doesn't get it all right: he's a bit of a kid himself. But his ""just say yes"" is a good antidote to the overprotective, overscheduled childhood that the movie's American critics espouse. (I raised 4 boys. I was also firmly told ""no"" when I wanted to put playground equipment outside some apartments I own.) The kid on the hood is a dumb thing to do; but the bathtub superhero is great, especially watching Owen at first think ""I can't allow that!"" and then ""but why not?"" The movie raises this as an issue to think about; and the critics seem unable to do so."
514,the-goods-live-hard-sell-hard-movie,KeithC,3," This movie had one or two mild laughs. Other than that I was thankful I saw it for free. I like Jeremy Piven's but the story of him being a mercenary hired to sell all the cars on the lot got do be boring by day 2 of the 4 days covered in the movie. I saw this movie at a drive-in and took advantage of the cool air by falling asleep during the rest of the movie (a first at the movies for me). Just shows how well it kept my attention. So, don't waste your money to see this movie. Its a good rental for a rainy day when you want to get some sleep and want to be mildly entertained."

523,reign-over-me-movie,MarkB.,2," A broken clock is right twice a day, and Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers is absolutely spot-on in his evaluation of this film. Writer-director Mike Binder, whose last theatrical effort was 2005's estimable The Upside of Anger, had no doubt the purest of intentions and the noblest of motives in making this exploration of a soul that's been completely shattered by a certain recent set of cataclysmic events, but the finished result is grotesque, tasteless and nearly unwatchable: Binder has made 9/11: The Sitcom. Can you use humor as a viable element in dealing with the near-unspeakable horror and tragedy of September 11 and its aftermath? Absolutely; one of the best songs on Bruce Springsteen's 9/11-themed DC The Rising is ""Mary's Place"", in which the protagonists deal by throwing a wild party, and even Paul Greengrass in United 93 used amusing conversations about families, dates and significant others by passengers and crew members of Flight 93 to intensify their humanity and our feeling of dread in knowing what was going to happen to them. Binder's basic storyline and framework is certainly viable: successful dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) bumps into his old college roomie Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), who's been ""dealing with"" the loss of his wife and kids by reverting to preadolescence and pretending his family never existed while spurning contact with anyone who reminds him that they did. As the treatment proves, however, Binder is certainly no Springsteen or Greengrass: it's one thing to be artistically ambivalent as to whether Charlie is a funny figure or a tragic one or both, but quite another to keep tweaking the tone from scene to scene for cheap emotional effects so that Binder can twist his audience like a Transformer toy. And then there's the extraordinarily inappropriate subplot involving a seemingly nymphomaniacal young woman (Saffron Burrows, who deserves a salute for doing her best under the circumstances) who's stalking Alan, the running gags in which various people get thrown out of Alan's office only to be readmitted two scenes later, and an annoyingly stereotypical, predictable approach to characterization that's perfectly illustrated by the assumption that because Alan is Black, he can't appreciate Charlie's favorite rock artists or any musician or group that isn't strictly R&amp;B. Even though Sandler's curiously acclaimed but strictly one-dimensional performance serendipitously dovetails with the writing, about the best thing I can say for it is that it's the inevitable price we pay for such GOOD recent work done by comic actors attempting to stretch as Will Ferrell in Stranger Than Fiction, Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Sandler himself in Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish. Cheadle and Jada Pinkett Smith (as his dissatisfied wife) are normally terrific, charismatic actors but here both come off as so chilly and unapproachable they seem to have force fields operating around them. Ironically, Reign Over Me's only good scene comes late in the film, involves Donald Sutherland as a judge who dispenses truly Solomon-like wisdom in his advice to Charlie's in-laws, and DOESN'T feature any of the three leads! It's obvious from many of these postings that a great many viewers were deeply moved or affected by this film, and I can't or won't try to argue with them. I will humbly suggest, however, that one of many possible reasons for this (at least in some cases) is that Reign Over Me IS exploring new ground by being the first major studio film to deal with the anguish of those who have lost loved ones due to 9/11-related causes. But just as 1947's Gentleman's Agreement won widespread acclaim and awards for being the first big American movie to deal with anti-Semitism, but later came to be seen as overly talky and self-congratulatory, not to say deeply inferior to later, better treatments of the subject (including the film noir Crossfire, released the same year), so will Reign Over Me be totally eclipsed by genuinely good or great movies dealing with its topic that have yet to be made. While Reign Over Me is hardly in the category of, say, the merchants in fall 2001 beating the drum for consumers to keep on consuming ""or else the terrorists win"", or Ann Coulter slandering 9/11 widows to whip up publicity for her latest book, it still comes across for this moviegoer as crass and exploitative. Worse still, it almost made me nostalgic for such ""pure"" Adam Sandler vehicles as The Longest Yard, Anger Management and Click. Almost!"

If you go in hoping to see a fun (and funny) popcorn movie with fantastic visuals, entertaining performances and some softly-delivered social messaging, then this is a perfectly good way to spend two hours. I'm really bothered by the criticism of Neil Blomkamp for supposedly becoming ""M. Night Shyamalan 2.0"". Just let the man make his weird movies. His vision is fresh and his movies are well crafted. Giving  rappers Die Antwoord (Ninja and Yo-Landi) major roles was a big risk that mostly paid off in the final scenes (and reinforced the distinctly South African feel of the movie). My advice? Ignore the haters and relax. ""Chappie"" might be a spiritual successor to ""Short Circuit,"" but it actually has a soul. That's no small feat in today's studio scene."

534,gravity-movie,llama007,2,"The movie is way to predictable and boring. Though it may look cool, it is lacking a good plot and is over all a very poorly made film. The movie starts out interesting because it is a completely new idea but as the story progresses the movie starts to get dull and boring. This is because it is missing a proper climax and everything is way to predictable. One other mistake is killing off george cloony which meant adding to how boring the film was, they even try to bring him back but it was just not good enough and they did not put enough effort to making a good film instead they put out a lot of effort into advertising the film by using two famous actors.

With animation so good in The Good Dinosaur, I constantly questioned if I was watching real footage rather than fictional scenery. Although the picture itself in The Good Dinosaur is stunning, the plot and story line is immature and basic. By no means is this a groundbreaking Pixar movie that can compare to there past creations such as Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, ect. But the film is playful and charming to say the least! It is a refreshing story in which two unlikely characters meet and take off on a rollercoaster of an adventure meeting new animals and learning new lessons along the way. They eventually expand and further the unknown characteristics within themselves, such as courage and hope! Overall, the story is touching and takes you on a (mostly) predictable ride, where the settings look extremely realistic. Disney and Pixar are successful once again in creating a story both enjoyable to adults and children of all ages, this is a must see film for those with young ones who are up for an amazing adventure."

Amazing interiors"", :""fast cheetahs"", ""Fassbinder licking muffin of Penelope Cruz who complains that it's dirty"", ""Queer Bardem"",  Diaz screwing the Ferrari""  ""Pitt loses his head due to idiotic device""... What a sham! But the worst part is dialogues. A good movie talking should do three things: move forward the plot, explore the characters, elicit some emotions. Here you have long imbecile speeches which try to pretend sexy, philosophic or smart. EVERY single person speaks as if they majored at ancient Greek literature. My god, what happened to good screenwriters? Studios should give the process back to independent producers, otherwise, in 5 years, people will go the cinemas just to eat some popcorn and play bowing."
547,a-walk-in-the-woods-movie,LeZee,8,"Rediscovering the old friendship in a long walk. I am very impressed for the recent films of Robert Redford, but the timing was really bad. His one man show, 'All is Lost' that overlapped with the popular flick 'Life of Pi', and now this with 'Tracks' and 'Wild'. People tend to choose the big one and forget the small one, or simply point the finger to the other one for having similarity. Anyway, I wanted to see it, and I did that. Like the Pacific Crest Trail from the movie 'Wild' which's from the western part of the Unites States, this one is from the east called Appalachian Trail and both these are the biographical films. The six month trail to cover approximately 2,000 kilometers. Even learning the odds are not in their favour, the two old men embark their journey with the fixed mind to achieve the goal. I did not know it was a screen adaptation of the real event. I won't consider it a great movie, not even for the year 2015, but it was fun to watch. A sweet little movie that I expected something, but it delivered another thing, overall it satisfied me. Maybe the reason I'm showing concern for this is it is a comedy, so looked lot like an entertainment product than the inspiring theme. But you can't deny the seriousness apart from those fun bits that it was based on someone's memoir. Especially knowing those two men are in the twilight of their lives, the attempt was admirable. ""No, writers don't retire. We either drink ourselvesto death or blow our brains out."" I always love the children and elder people movies with quality narration. Children's films are fun to watch and elder's teaches us their experiences, sometimes sympathy wins for their struggles. There were a couple big female star characters who are the part of the story, but not in the main narration. This film centres only two characters that wonderfully played by the 80 year-old Robert Redford as a 60 year-old Bill Bryson and the other one was Nick Nolte as Katz who actually stole the show. Yep, I must agree Nick Nolte is the backbone of the movie, otherwise the people would have turned away without showing any interest in this including myself. This film was not all about the hiking or achieving something out of all the sudden in their old age. It let's us a few glimpses of the beautiful landscapes like those we saw in the 17th, 18th century paintings. Despite it being a comedy, mostly it dealt with the facts. Rediscovering the lost friendship and uncovering the old memories. Like the entire life was brought back for a few minutes in the words for us with their sweet recalls. It is an R rated flick, because the majority of the jokes were adult's. If you decide to watch it, I suggest to give a try with your best friend, because you both might be seeing the future of yourselves. My finishing statement is, it is definitely not a must see, but it won't disappoint either if you're not anticipating in a large scale adventure, that includes emotions and severeness. If it was from before the 90s, probably considered as a good film, but in this modern CGI world, movies about life and self-discovery is fading away from the young people's mind. All they want is superheroes, loud music, fancy costumes, and of course violence. 7/10"

549,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Creeper3455,9,"BIG FAN RANT ALERT! (Seriously,I warned you.)So...After the huge 'Tidal Wave' that was the fans tearing the movie apart with a massive hate on it (move over,prequels),I was really scared for the screening,but in the end was Star Wars The Last Jedi a massive letdown (as the fans 'always' say)? Wrong. A 1000 times wrong. This is one of the best movies i've seen this year,even if it's nowhere near Empire Strikes Back. The pure love that an indie director like Rian Johnson (Brick,Looper) crafts throughout was so impressive,I kept smiling for the whole runtime. Like some rare sequels (say,the recent Blade Runner 2049 or Toy Story 2),this is one of those that truly expands upon the last one,with a production design that really loves the universe and tries to put every single detail on it. Think of it like a birthday cake: You have the bread,which is the set design,a delicious cream made of Oscar-worthy Visual and Sound Effects,the taste of the bread which is the story that delivers some surprising twists and a comedic timing that I only saw in Empire,and then the candles,which are the score (this time made excellently by John Williams,unlike TFA) and the acting,with Mark Hamill delivering the example of what a Supporting Actor Oscar nominee should look and be like,Adam Driver constantly evolving through his career with a Kylo Ren that is truly written this time around,and the saddest tribute I could have ever seen in a movie by Carrie Fisher. And yeah,the Porgs sure are adorable,i'll put those as sprinkles on my cake,thanks. The only flaw that keeps it from a 10/10 is the relation (?) between Finn (played by John Boyega) and Rose (played by Kelly Marie Tran). It almost makes the experience distracting from the main story,but it's not like a huge pinpoint. It was decent to look at. And another flaw isn't specifically with the movie,but it's revolved around the internet,and that's the fans: ""Overrated st""""It changes nothing we have had for 2 years while having the slowest space chase in cinematic history.""""Too Dn long!""EVERYONE HAS TO SETTLE THE CREEPER DOWN. If you are reading this as a fan,hoew the living TNT could you get upset and mad at this?!? You did the same thing in TFA being ''A New Hope 2.0"" (one of its biggest cons and pros),now you're being mad at something that tries to go a different route rather than being ''Empire Strikes Back 2.0''?!? Well,good luck on making this the ""mother!"" of Sci-Fi movies... Because that's how the Internet works... And 2017's horrid generation of young audience members... (i'm 15).But anyway,yes,i do recommend checking out The Last Jedi. Trust me,it'll be worth your time and the hype."

553,the-giver-movie,Spangle,3,"It seems Hollywood has this factory in which it manufactures a variety of products. From bad by-committee scripts, unholy editing mishmashes at the behest of studios when a director gets too auteur for their liking, and of course their most rewarding product line: bland 20-something actors for young adult movies. Brenton Thwaites and Odeya Rush have to be the most bland of them all with both entirely lacking any semblance of acting ability, yet they look young and the teen target audience will find them mildly attractive. Thwaites is so bland, in fact, that I did not remember I saw him in Gods of Egypt where he was practically the lead. Now that is bland. He is a cardboard cut out of a young adult actor and Rush is hardly much better. The Giver also has a rare bad performance from Meryl Streep alongside a good one from Jeff Bridges, who constantly seems shocked by how bad the movie around him is turning out to be. You can practically see Bridges trying to remember how big the paycheck was for this one and trying to ascertain whether it was worth it or not in the end.Surrounding these unfortunate actors is the plot of The Giver, which is actually quite compelling when considering just the premise. Set in a world where all emotion, feeling, memory, and color has been erased, the world is divided into communities watched over the elders, namely Chief Elder (Streep). At various stages of life, there are ceremonies. When one is given to their family, when they are nine years old, when they graduate from school and are given their job, and when they are released to elsewhere. At the graduation ceremony, Jonas (Thwaites) is skipped over and called last, as he is to become the new Receiver of Memory. He is the only one allowed to feel, have emotions, and learn about the past and what the world used to be and he must learn from The Giver (Jeff Bridges), who is the current receiver of memory. Yet, armed with his knowledge about how they ""release"" aka kill the elderly and babies, as well as his love of Fiona (Rush), Jonas wants to save the world and give everybody what the Elders had taken away many years ago.Yet, how the film approaches this is quite heavy-handed. Acting all knowing, the film shows how with hate and war, which are bad and why feeling was stamped out, also comes love. And love is worth everything. While this may be true to some degree, it simply sounds preachy and then the film further digs its grave by including obnoxious montages where it celebrates life and shows the beauty of the world. It practically plays like an advertisement for life where the film constantly preaches about the power of love and how it outweighs hate in the world. Again, maybe true, but The Giver always comes off as pretending to know everything about the world and having to teach the viewer about what it all means. While it has a compelling premise, it panders too heavily to the young adult audience in this regard with an over-the-top demonstration of love and how it can solve all things. It is too naive and romanticized to really work and not come off as pandering, ham-fisted, and coming from a place of great superiority.This same appeal to young adults is found in the ""transformational"" and ""eye opening""  romance between two bland leads that lack chemistry or any character development whatsoever. Instead, they are just young adult romantic stock characters that have this unspoken passion for one another even when neither are actually able to feel anything. They lack any definition and instead are written to have the other complete their worlds. In many respects, they are Manic Pixie Dream Boy/Girl's for one another and act entirely selflessly to advance the other, but ironically, when two Manic Pixie Dream Boy/Girl's meet, nobody advances. These are thinly written characters to the point that they are practically invisible. Every action is for plot convenience and the acting hardly breathes life into these stock characters found in The Giver.For a film with such a compelling premise, it winds up being largely quite tame. With bad characters, a bad romance, bad acting, and a heavy handed and naive take on life and love, The Giver winds up piling up weaknesses that sinks its ship. Yet, these are mostly quite passive. None of these bad elements are absolutely abhorrent and the film never winds up battling between being bad and dreadful. Instead, it just toes the line and is entirely passively bad, going down with nary a whimper. It is a film that is content to appeal to its target demographic, present hollow and naive ideas that appear thoughtful and appeal to the minds of teenagers, and then toss out some bland young actors that also appeal to that demographic. It is a film that is defined by just how below average it is and how safe it plays everything. It is this paleness that relegates The Giver to being so average and safe that it is bad."
554,inglourious-basterds-movie,Judddy,8,"Exceptionally gory, even for a Quentin Tarantino film, it is not for the faint hearted. 'Inglourious Basterds' is a feast of humour, suspense, and blood, and is thoroughly entertaining. The acting, especially from Christoph Waltz and Diane Kruger, is superb. The witty, clever dialogue, a trademark of Tarantino films, makes up a wonderful screenplay. You are almost kept on the edge of your seat throughout this film because it is so unpredictable, featuring numerous plot twists and unexpected outcomes. I must admit, I was expecting a little bit more than what I got because there is no denying, it is quite slow, but I was nonetheless impressed by the film overall."
555,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,jurep,2,"Bad story structure. Too long. Full of product placement. It's time for Star Wars to end.I liked The Force Awakens. Even though it was not a perfect movie, it set up story arcs that I was excited about. TLJ took a massive dump on those arcs. The movie was a mess. It not only destroyed what the previous movie created, it ruined the character of Luke Skywalker. It's pointless, inconsistent, and awkwardly tries to recreate the original trilogy by artificially resetting the universe to the same state.Don't bother."
556,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Minijunkie,9,"It's funny - I see people asking ""what movie did the critics watch"", and I'm over here wondering what movie THEY watched. The critics are bang on with their assessment here. This was awesome! I had my expectations beaten and lowered badly by these crappy user scores, and the movie delivered on the heart and action I would want from a Star Wars movie. I honestly don't get the negativity. I halfway think there's some sort of ""anti-SJW"" angle to it, which is really stupid if that's the case. Either that or people had trouble understanding or following what was going on. It's hard to say.  Actually the more I read reddit, the more I realize a lot of people didn't understand some of the plot points.  Some of them are pretty subtle.The movie isn't perfect - it has pacing issues for sure, and was too long in my opinion. It could have used some editing and some of the story arcs dragged a bit. But damn, the action was fantastic, and they put in some great plot twists and surprising moments (although I saw a couple of them coming) - it wasn't nearly as cut-and-dried fan service as TFA (although I loved that one too). Honestly, people are out to lunch with this negativity.Oh, and I also see complaints about the humor and jokes. Really? What series have you been watching all this time? There is a LOT of humor in Star Wars, and that's what makes it so damn entertaining. Get the sticks out of your butts.Lastly, please be aware that older fans of the franchise are capable of loving this movie (I'm a lifelong fan, 45 years old) - I think some folks assume all the negativity is coming from that age group, but that's not the case."
557,cake-movie,Lyn,7,"She's still gorgeous, of course, but Jennifer Aniston finally has reached the point where some pretty good makeup and a depressed demeanor can make her look at lot more relatable. I wanted to compare it with ""The Good Girl,"" another pretty good portrayal by her that couldn't quite make you believe her in a blue-collar setting. I thought she was good as this depressed woman with every reason to give up on life. The problem here was that so many actresses have done the grieving mother in a way that rips your heart out ... Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts, Mary Tyler Moore, and maybe most stunningly, Laura Morante in ""The Son's Room"" (Italian). ""Cake"" just isn't different enough or strong enough overall to compare with those films. Neither is Aniston, but her portrayal of depression is convincing."
558,the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-3d-movie,ScarTissue1990,3,"Woah. Well, this movie was pretty sad. It's was very generic and predictable. We've seen it before, the same lines, the same actions, the same plot. It was very disappointing."
559,no-movie,GreatMartin,2,"After 15 years of a dictatorship Chilean Augusto Pinochet, due to international pressure, was allowing the people to vote in an upcoming plebiscite, an expression of the people’s will, as to whether they favored, voting ‘yes’ or not, voting ‘no’ as to if Pinchot should remain in office. There was no doubt, legally or not, that the majority of people would vote ‘yes’. Director Pablo Larrain has made this docudrama regarding the election with a screenplay by Pedro Peirano based on a play by Antonio Skarmeta called “The Referendum” and retitled it “No”. Each side of the question had 15 minutes a day to run an ad on television for 27 straight days with most of the ‘no’ ads regulated to the late hours. Rene Saavedra (Gael Garcia Bernal) is a hot shot ad executive who is put in charge of the No vote and tackles it like he was selling a previous product he handled which was a soda called Free. He uses marketing for politics as most ad agencies use it to sell cars, vacation spots or anything that uses balloons, rainbows, kids, blue skies and, in this case a mime that is a running joke throughout the movie. Rene is prime custodian of his son Simon (Pascal Montero) while his estranged, activist wife Veronica (Antonia Zegers) accuses him of working for the Pinochet regime. He is the son of an exiled Chilean dissident and Rene dresses in jeans to work and skate boards all over town. He also doesn’t hesitate to send his kid to bed so that he could play with Simon’s train set. It is an old friend of his father’s, socialist politician Urrutia (Luis Gnecco) who talks Rene into taking the ad campaign while Rene’s boss Lucho Guzman (Alfredo Castro) takes the opposing campaign. While it may have been in keeping with the time I found the direction, camerawork and editing to be very distracting, in some spots amateurish, and didn’t really add anything to the film. Gael Garcia Bernal has a very interesting face, penetrating eyes and, if you have seen him in any other film, you know he is a fine actor who needs that breakout role but this isn’t it. After watching “No” for an hour and fifty-eight minutes I have to get corny and end with say no to “No”."
560,the-incredibles-movie,spongeswift,9,"The Incredibles is easily some of Pixar's best work. It's story is so serious and risk taking that, that alone makes it a very good movie. You can just feel the tension in Bob's and Helen's marriage and you can feel the depression of Bob not being able to be a Super. Edna Mode steals the show though. She is funny, fassionale, and blunt. Syndrome is my only gripe. He is much too cheesy to be an amazing villain in my mind. Overall The Incredibles is one of Pixar's most serious and at the same time funniest flicks out there."

562,ghostbusters-2016-movie,teefuses,2,Steaming pile of turd. Utterly no effort shown by the cast in trying to make this a success. Everyone involved should be ashamed. The script must be a one pager. Even Melissa McCarthy was not her usual self. The lamest of lame jokes accompanied by a continual vomit of CGI special effects. This is not why I go to the movies. And what's with the BS reviews on RT?
563,warcraft-movie,Craidd,3,"This film is an example of the incompetnce of the director and the most part of the person that have create the film and the stupidity of the audience, because is enough show a couple of sword magic to make a good fim for them. Only the part of the orcs are good, but the rest of  the film is a mix of bad choices, dialogues without sense, orrible sceneplay and bad actor in bad charater that are bi dimensiona. The film is full of naive comicality and epic but fool scene."
564,the-beguiled-movie,RooneyRebert,3,"While the exterior shots were lovely, this movie was exceptionally dull and not very steamy.  There were some amusing moments, but I was glad for it to end.

565,the-queen-movie,JudyL.,10," An excellent film - Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen are both tremendous as the Queen and Tony Blair, respectively. The supporting cast is also outstanding, including the film clips of Princess Diana.

566,the-emoji-movie-movie,keatonmerrell,0,"How do i accurately detail the absolute hells cape that is The Emoji Movie. The entire time I was watching it I was feeling real life pain due to some of the most cringey, depressing, and unironic writing I have ever seen in a blockbuster film. The half-baked social commentary was both unintelligent and by-the-numbers when it came to feminism, being who you are, and honesty in relationships; but the downright glaringly awkward issue of the role of technology (or even product placement) in our lives was lost on the makers of this fine movie."

568,dirty-rotten-scoundrels-movie,geedup,7,"Rewatched this movie for the first time in years, and it hasn't stood the test of time. Very cliche'd for these times, but still gives a few laughs-which seem to be ad-libbed -a bit off script if you will. The polar opposites of these two is what makes the movie and two better actors to play these roles would be hard to find at the time of this movie."
569,suicide-squad-movie,gtwist,2,"Besides from a couple good performances, Suicide Squad was a disaster! David Ayer is about as horrible as a person as he is a filmmaker. The movie is poorly shot, and the action scenes are all bland. There are a lot of useless characters, and arcs that are underdeveloped. I admire Jared Leto for not being like Heath Ledger, because that would be really easy. He gets almost no screen time, and isn't even the main villain, and his dialog is horrible. Suicide Squad is one of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen."
570,inglourious-basterds-movie,kilahchris,1,"Only Tarantino can take an event like WW2 and make a boring directionless movie like Inglourious basterds. He decides to recreate WW2 events to show the world his love for (hard on for) mindless violence and long pointless dialougues. The fundamental problem with this film, is that if you are going to recreate an actual historical event,  the film has it has to be funny. Without Humor an audience familiar to WW2 history will find this to be boring inaccurate rubbish. The movie is formulated into several chapters covering lives of Shoshana who escapes near death at hands of Christopher Waltz and the nazis. I will not get to much into detail because i do not want to spoil the move. However the movie evolves into an unreleastic convulted plot to assasinate Adolf Hitler. The ending does provide a little suspense but this is around the 2 in a half hour mark. When the movies was over I was left wondering why did I waste 2 in half hours watching this abomination.  All in All we have a Quentin Tarantino's wet dream of what happened in WW2, packed with mindless violence, boring dialogues and worse convuluted plot imaginable. This movie is neither humourous or entertaining. Avoid at all cost."
571,yes-man-movie,Summersausage,7,There are alot of negative reviews about this movie but I like it. It was cute funny and had some clever lines. It's the less indie Nick and Norah and it wasn't like the best but it averaged out cute with cool events in someones life.

573,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,evazan21,3,"If I ignore all the other Star Wars movies the plot of this movie is still contrived.  The entire second act of the movie only happens as a result of using the ""idiot plot"" trope.  The plot is not driven by characters motivations, instead bizarre scenarios are concocted solely to get characters to act in certain ways.In the Context of the previous 7 movies this film makes even less sense.  No context is given to explain how the characters we are supposed to relate to got themselves or the republic into this situation  Episdoes I-VI are made irrelevant in the opening crawl  ""The FIRST ORDER reigns. Having decimated the peaceful Republic, Supreme Leader Snoke now deploys his merciless legions to seize military control of the galaxy.""  Episode VII turns out to be a giant Red Herring.  Who is Snoke?  Why did Lukes light saber reach out to Rey?  Why did we hear Obi-Wans voice in Rey's force Dream?  The entire plot of TFA revolved around a Map to Luke.  Why did this map exist?  Why did R2-D2 have half the map?  Why did R2-D2 wake from his coma when Rey showed up?  Apparently none of that mattered.I understand making an attempt to subvert the audiences expectations but this movie just seemed to go out of its way to trash everything leading up to it."

577,doctor-strange-movie,2morovian,1,"It's a 2 hour clutter of borrowed and extremely overused cliches, as hollow as Hollywood itself. There is, literally, nothing original about this film and nothing worth wasting a minute of your life on unless you are as shallow and disjointed as the people who created it or the others who whored themselves to participate in this mess. I'm specifically referring to certain actors who are better than this and who should know better; Tilda Swindon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, Rachel McAdams &amp; Benedict Wong.

It's also got pandering written all over it, even if it were about Donald Trump I would still hate it.  In conclusion, you can get a better view of the candidate through using multiple news outlets, and you wasted your money seeing this rather than seeing Finding Dory with your children, how sad."

580,brokeback-mountain-movie,MichaelL.,10," Without a doubt, the best film of the year. It is subtle and respectful. It doesn't manipulate. It has a story to tell, and it does so--beautifully. The acting is superb. The directing is restrained. These are people you feel you know; not actors playing parts. The biggest tragedy of ""Brokeback Mountain"" is that small-minded people insist it's ""propaganda"" for the ""gay agenda"". Those who could learn from it won't see it; those who could maybe see that love is indeed a force of nature by viewing this gorgeous and haunting film, never will because of preconceived ideas and/or ignorance. For those who open their hearst and minds, this movie is a gem. The most perfect example of heart-wrenching, doomed love since Romeo and Juliet."
581,independence-day-resurgence-movie,mike1401,0,"It's a B movie with special effects.

582,mission-impossible-5-movie,Spanky,3,"I agree with totally with Sesshomurai's review.  Read it for a detailed critique.  My additional problems are: The humor in the opening and various other places in the film was so out of place for this type of action movie, that it gave me a bad flashback to when the James Bond films jumped the shark with snide remarks and fancy gadgets instead of a tight, gritty, strong screenplay. The plot was stupid and predictable.  Definitely the worst of this series. The movie was too long and just when I thought it was about to wrap up, they started a fourth and fifth act. The villain was good until he started speaking.  He had this kind of higher pitched voice and he whispered all his lines.  Very annoying. Not trying to pick on Cruise, I really like the guy; but his overly boyish haircut in parts of the flick, made him look like a 53 year old trying to look like a 17 year old.  Very disconcerting.  Hard to imagine him as a master spy.  I also believe that Tom Cruise needed to lose about 10-15 lbs. in order to make some of his action sequences more believable.  All in all, a very big disappointment."

587,the-ghost-writer-movie,utmam,2,"I've always believed that movie reviewers are desperate to be seen as cultured, intelligent, ""I'm more insightful than you"" types. Therefore, when they come across a movie like this - a movie that SEEMS like it should be good, has the look of something that should grab your attention, and, most important, sounds intelligent - they rave about it because their hubris prevents them from saying, ""I don't get it!"" This is not a great movie. I'll be honest in saying that I don't quite get the ending. I mean, I do, but was the ""secret"" really that significant? If you didn't figure this all out in the private jet scene, then perhaps you are a movie critic. It's sad too, because the cast should have been excellent. Pierce Brosnan generally has his moments, Ewan McGregor is often quite good, Olivia Williams has had a few brilliant roles, and Tom Wilkinson is, in my opinion, one of the great, under appreciated actors, ever. Conversely Kim Catrall may be one of the worst actors ever and this role only solidifies her in that position. But in this movie they were all as flat and dull as Catrall's ""accent"". IMO the only really good acting in this movie was that of Wilkinson and Eli Wallach. Regrettably, these two roles are little more than bit parts. The rest was so ho hum that I needed two nights to watch it."

591,frantic-re-release-movie,Mr.Hankey,10," I am not hear to rate Elevator to the Gallows but one of my favorite films by Louis Malle because unfortunately it is not in metacritic. Au Revoir Les Enfants is a tale of two boys and their friendship that develops through struggle and understanding. The story is a beautiful and sad meaning that pops out of Louis Malle's somewhat autobiographical film. Because this is German occupied France their is pain and tragedy sweeping across the nation and all that pain is really connected with these two little boys secret and I will guess that you will just have to find out what that secret is. But this movie has made me think since it's story is so meaningful and proud. But yet you still will think that their is no end to this horrible fate that is to come. Becaue you will be saying at the end of the the film Au Revoir Les Enfants( Goodbye, Children )."

593,anonymous-2011-movie,Cinemaphile,1,"Anonymous is an Elizabethan whodunnit with slick production values brought to you by he who cannot be named. No, not Voldemort, but the creative mind behind Independence Day and Godzilla. Anyone with a little knowledge of the era and the sense of a billy goat will recognize the implausibility of the plot based on a discredited academic theory that Earl of Oxford was the genius behind William Shakespeare. To boot, scribe John Orloff of Band of Brothers fame, throws in a second academic theory, that of Prince Tudor, bastard son of Elizabeth I and same said Earl. Orloff then doubles down on the implausible by having the Earl of Oxford himself be Elizabeth's first bastard son, giving this conspiracy-fest an oh so needed Oedipal quality it was heretofore lacking. Anonymous, like Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, is a dangerously indulgent jaunt down the lane of fictional history. Films such as this one make the jobs of real educators much harder, couching sensational, salacious and entertaining fiction as within the realm of probability. It's not possible to libel the dead, but this craptacular vehicle does it's damn level best. Avoid this film like the plague, you'll glean nothing from it other than a vague sense that you have some secret, knowledge akin to that bestowed by The DaVinci Code."

595,oz-the-great-and-powerful-movie,FreedomFighters,7,"Fresh off of their success with ""Alice in Wonderland,"" Disney decided that they wanted to continue to make big, CGI-heavy, live action fantasy films. Enter ""Oz the Great and Powerful,"" a Sam Raimi film featuring James Franco, Mila Kunis, luscious CGI visuals and 3D. Essentially all the makings of a Hollywood blockbuster. How does the film fare? Actually, pretty well. It's visually dazzling, pretty well-acted, considerably exciting, and decently written. Sure, it could be better in plenty of areas, but all things considered, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a pretty good film that's definitely worth at least one watch."

The graphics were the best i've ever seen on a CGI film, and the story was heart-warming and a delight to watch. However, towards the end the film became more stereotypical in a sense, Hero saves the day blah blah blah, but it was carried out in such manner that softened the blow, well one, by not using any magical fairytale lands, and two, rasing awareness of environmental issues although I won't spoil it for you. To be fair, the movie is aimed at children, so as long as it pleases them, nothing else matters, right? Anyway, a worthwhile watch with an odd Twist."

I came into this film with absolutely no expectations.  I had not heard nor read one word about it.  My dad (father!) left it at my house and I figured I would throw it in the DVD player one Sunday evening after reading the Netflix synopsis.  Yes, I did see that it had Brad Pitt and Sean Penn in it, but that meant nothing to me, one way or the other.I'm afraid to say, for fear of sounding like any other cliche art critic, that what I saw was nothing short of astonishing.  ToL is an existential masterpiece.I'm not sure how anyone can rate this move a 0 or 1 even if it was the most ""boring"" thing they ever had to sit through.  It's as if they went into this movie with expectations that were not fulfilled and have therefore taken it personally.  I can understand how this movie might not resonate with everyone, but does it really warrant a 0--as if to say it has no value whatsoever?  It seems as if some of these reviews feel the need to overcompensate for reasons that have nothing to do film itself.  I'm sorry if someone or some review duped you into this one and you didn't think it was worth your $10, but don't take it all out on the film.  I'm pretty sure anyone can honestly find reason enough to give it at least a 3.  It's not Troll 2 for crying out loud."
624,independence-day-movie,Jacob,7,"I may be biased as I love the style of filmmaking from the 90s but I really enjoyed this film. I will admit that it has problems like a somewhat cheesy tone but I like the characters and the story flows nicely. Plus, the flying sequences are cool. The effects were probably groundbreaking back then and still hold up today, and the film looks great visually. Definitely check this one out if you haven’t seen it already. If this film was a summer blockbuster then awesome because this would have been a great theater going experience."
625,the-other-side-of-the-door-movie,NerdConsultant,3,there's really much originality in this film apart from the fact that these horror tropes have an indian twist based on hindu mythology.  it relies way to hard on jump scares and horror clichés and has absolutely no idea what it wants to do with this plot which only works because the characters are really dumb and some very dumb moments as a result. it has some good cinematography but if i were you i'd skip it.
626,grindhouse-movie,thedude,9," Great movie. You can watch it as it was shown in theatres (both movies together, with fake trailers) on Starz On Demand."
627,blade-runner-2049-movie,danielv,10,"Wow! What can i say, as soon as this movie ended i knew that it was going to be a long time before a ever saw a quality sci-fi like this again. I am a fan of the original and this one is as good. A masterpiece for sure and it expands significantly the original story. I relished every minute of this film and wish that the bluray version comes with a longer version (yes more more more). Kudos the french Canadian (Quebec) director Denis Villeneuve for nailing this!"
628,predator-movie,Meth-dude,7,"""Predator"" is your usual 80's action movie. Big guys, big guns, big shootouts, explosions and great one-liners said by the great Schwarzenegger. If you're looking for a good Schwarzenegger action movie, you'll probably like it."
629,the-deer-hunter-movie,MoneyMaker101,10,One of the greatest movies I have ever seen.The plot is interesting and characters are really emotional and this movie shows all problems of war and how war meaningless is.
630,gravity-movie,bob516,10,"Brilliant movie!  Visually stunning, with a storyline that has only two characters, and takes us on a roller coaster ride of suspense for the full length of the running time gets my vote for best movie of the year.   Some  minor problems with dialogue and character studies, but when I am so fully engaged in the movie that I feel like I am there with the actors, allows me to be forgiving of the flaws. After I left the theater and drove home I could not put on music or talk radio, I needed let the movie stay in my thoughts, uninterrupted, for a while.  Another sign of a great movie."
631,madagascar-movie,MarkB.,1," I waited forever to see this popular CGI-fest because Robots and Shark Tale left me cringing in abject terror at any piece of 3-D computer-generated animation NOT bearing the Pixar label...but the short subject featuring the Madagascar penguins that preceded Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit turned out to be surprisingly bearable (if immediately forgettable compared to the feature that followed), so I ponied up my $2.50 to finally check it out at a discount theater, and guess what? This turned out to be by far the worst of the sorry bunch: a film so relentlessly shrill, assaultive, headache-inducing, self-satisfied and aggressively unfunny that it ALMOST made me want to re-evaluate Shark Tale, which at least had some well-cast voices, and Robots, which boasted some impressively elaborate animation set-ups. (Notice that I said ALMOST; life is already too short, I just blew 80 minutes on this, and I'm sure there are sock drawers that need rearranging somewhere.) This completely heartless, soulless and utterly disjointed tale of city zoo animals forced back into the wild, where they have to face their primal instincts and temptations certainly had potential, but stampedes it completely beneath an endless cacaphony of pop-culture riffs and movie references (I hesitate to even call most of them ""jokes""; they're so joyless and perfunctory that they're far more accurately described as checklist items) that take the place of a cohesive script; this is exactly the same chop-suey corporate writing approach that turned The Simpsons from what was at one time the greatest TV show on the air to the completely unwatchable farrago it is today. I was shocked to see Hans Zimmer's name credited to the music; his work may have been one of several contributions to turning The Lion King from an animated kiddie musical into a dramatic movie of real heft, but Madagascar is so wall-to-wall loaded with push-button soundbites from TV and movies (the worst example: the Hawaii Five-O theme IMMEDIATELY followed by the Chariots of Fire theme) that I honestly don't recall any background music that Zimmer contributed! I'm certainly well aware that the history of popular animation--from Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoons to Rocky and Bullwinkle to even the early years of The Flintstones--includes many examples of simultaneously appealing to kids on one level while pitching jokes to adults that the little ones won't catch (the ""NUTS"" gag in the Wallace &amp; Gromit movie is a delightful contemporary example of this) ...but Madagascar tips the scale so far one way that it made me start to understand Michael Medved's appreciation of Barney the Dinosaur playing 100% to his wee audience and completely chucking the smart-aleck postmodernism, especially during the truly hateful bit about cute little creatures being devoured in the jungle that made one little guy in my audience burst into sobs. The character design is harsh and repellent, with the lemurs' egg-yolk eyes in particular being...well, an eyesore; the animation, especially of people and crowds, is frequently inept; of the voices, Chris Rock comes off as the most overbearing, Jada Pinkett Smith the least, and most of the others far closer to Rock than Smith. Some have argued that Madagascar's uber-rapid-fire, yock-on-top-of-yock approach carries on the tradition of what Tex Avery did so successfully in the 1940s and 1950s, but there IS a crucial difference: Avery's features worked because he limited them to 7 minutes. But then, Madagascar is hardly a movie that respects its betters: early on, a couple of monkeys discuss flinging their poo at Tom Wolfe. Now we can agree to disagree about I Am Charlotte Simmons, but for a group of hack committee sitcom writers to make a comment like that about the master satirist who wrote the brilliant novels The Bonfire of the Vanities and A Man In Full (whether he wears a white suit or not) merely underscores the wise old agage: throw one piece of poo, get 1,463,892 pieces of poo thrown back at yourself. At least!"
632,fantastic-four-movie,WesselK.,3," If there's no story, the special effects have no function, and the characters are cartboard."
633,invasion-of-the-body-snatchers-movie,Meth-dude,8,"Definitely one of the best sci-fi/horror movies of it's time. With great acting, impressive practical effects and a very atmospheric soundtrack, Invasion of the Body Snatchers delivers and gives much more than what you would expect."
634,rollerball-movie,ChrisD.,0," I'm sad i watched this movie. It was TERRIBLE. Aside the bad acting, you have terrible editing (the camera would cut for no reason... a character would be looking one way, then an instant later the other direction...) There was no explanation for why most people died... The rest is just too stupid for words... This kinda movie makes me wanna cry :-"
635,her-movie,Dokalu,7,"“Her” is a science fiction, fresh love story in a not so distant future about a lonely man who falls in love with his operating system. First off, the obvious, nice acting, nice directing, and excellent, very realistic script focusing really much on the characters and their development as truly real people through the film. Now, the story. I think it’s really original and they chose the perfect actors for it. Some may think that it was slow, but I actually believe that it had the perfect rhythm for what it was trying to tell, and it was told really well. Also, the movie has a really deep message about artificial intelligence, what it can get to be and how will humans react to it.Besides from that, I’m not going to deny that there were some parts that, though necessary to the story, were simply boring, and that there were actually some scenes that may as well not have been in there. Chris Pratt wasn’t necessary in this movie, he could perfectly have been cut out from it.Real score: 7.4"
636,savages-movie,coco4bee,0,"Too much exaggeration and commercialism. All the love-making and inhumane treatment of human bodies did not support the main point of the movie or at least, make up for the lack of real action. The kind of action is like throwing grenades and shooting big guns..nothing that requires too much skill (the way a real action film is suppose to be). This movie tried too hard to be sexy, scary, and hardcore."
637,guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie,grandpajoe6191,8,"WOW, just wow. Aside from the obviously excellent production value and impressive action sequences, ""Guardians of The Galaxy"" masterfully tells the tale of five heroes, each unique in his/her own right, setting aside their differences to defeat the forces of evil in the galaxy; its such a cliched plot but director James Gunn manages to breath new life into it with his funny, exciting, and light-hearted style of directing (add in the charming performance of Chris Pratt as Starlord with it too), a huge factor that really won me over for this amazing movie. Easily the best Marvel superhero movie up to date. #IAmGroot"
638,astro-boy-movie,cm,10, Astro boy was a great family movie. It had a good moral story to it. It taught kids that they should give everyone a chance before they judge each other. It also showed that we are all different in certain ways and can still get along with everyone no matter how different we are.
639,127-hours-movie,fanguychris,10,"Danny Boyle has created a truely amazing film. You would think that a film almost entirely set in small hole wouldn't work but thanks to Danny Boyle's brilliant direction and James Franco's amazing performance, I could not take my eyes away from the film the whole time it lasted, and yes even during the amputation scene. It did loose momentum slightly around the middle of the film but it more than made up for it with such an inspiring final act that you will remember for a long time. It's not for everyone but if it remotely interests you, watch it, i'm sure you will not be disappointed."
640,the-lost-city-of-z-movie,badgerryan19,9,"A movie that I had to wait for months to see since our theater didn't show it and does it deliver. This movie was extremely engaging and exciting from start to beginning. The acting from Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson was mesmerizing. The movie also looks fantastic and it reminds me of classic films like Indiana Jones. I can understand why people are split on this, but I have to say this is a Best Picture nominee from me already."
641,pirates-of-the-caribbean-at-worlds-end-movie,DavidS.,2," Like the 2nd installment, this one wasn't very good. Lacks the humor and heart of the original."
642,harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-movie,JamesC.,2," Gutted! im a massive potter fan, i love the books and Half Blood Prince is my favourite book, i love the way it develops the relationship between harry and dumbledore whilst filling voldermorts backstory. all these happens amongst the teen angst and the back drop of voldermorts rise to power. The film achieves none of this! it bumbles around, from half baked story line to pointless new scene. i wont ruin it for those who havent seen it but voldermorts childhood and teen years are largely ignored, most of the main characters outside of harry, ron, hermione and dumbledore barely have a line. i wont even mention the rest of the pivital stuff this movie misses out, however how they have made a movie without the pivotal final scene where harry decides not to come back to hogwarts for his final year is beyond me. the romance between harry and ginny barely registers as happening... i mean they have totally butchered this tremendous book.... in fact i would sooner listen to the brilliant stephen frys audiobook than watch this hatchet job ever again. unfortunately David Yates is back directing both parts of the deathly hallows, so for me that means another hatchet job will be made on the excellent finale... oh how i want del toro to direct them over this useless yates idiot! Gutted!"
643,reign-over-me-movie,HC,9," Adam Sandler was so believably screwed-up in this movie. When he finally talked about his family, I sat in the theater with tears streaming down my face, thinking about the people who really lost their families in those planes. I LOVED this movie and adore Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. I don't think Jada and Liv had strong enough roles, and I hate that they felt they had to stick in a sappy happy ending...although you find yourself relieved that the poor guy's luck was turning around. LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it."
644,batman-begins-movie,DanielL.,10, Loved It No more kiddy stuff.
645,wedding-crashers-movie,Mark,0," purely dumb, boring, way too long, vulgar and not entertaining in the least."
646,hot-pursuit-movie,coloradosnowman,0,"Let me put it this way: this movie sucked bad enough to make a Kevin James movie look Oscar-worthy. I've sat through some pretty bad movies in the past, this is in the first in a while that I've wanted a refund halfway-through."
647,a-quiet-place-movie,Violett,7,"Pros: - Nice and unique idea - to live without sound - Emily Blunt is great actress, acting at all, of all actors in this move is good - Daughter-actress is deaf in real life - this was strong and noble act by directorCons: numerous plot holes, NUMEROUS - First of all - who in such place and such time ever so stupid to give birth to children? Worst place imaginable. No condoms or? Beyond stupid - Why in the world they have so many light devices but only one firework to distract creatures out? Seriously, some air horns away from home? No? But more lamps for sure!Well, I understand those terrible plot holes had to be here to make a movie as it is. In other time I would give it 2 or 3 out of 10, but now I give it 7 due to pros. Can I recommend it? I'm not sure, prolly not though."
648,transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-movie,JuanN,3," On par with the 1st movie. Crappy script, annoying actors, cool robots and good action."
649,arrival-movie,patrickblakely,0,"It's all too rare these days that studios partner with adept filmmakers with clear visions. Denis Villeneuve is one of those upper-tier directors whose previous works have ranged in genre and style, yet authenticity is central to their premises. This is his best film yet and comes at a time when, perhaps, we need it the most. My favorite film of 2016."
650,indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull-movie,JonF.,3," I am frankly shocked that a poll of film critics would give this ludicrous mess a favorable review. Could Joel Schumaker teamed with Michael Bay do any worse? Can't wait for the next Indy film set in the 1960s, he'll probably surf into Earth's atmosphere on space debris (a la DARKSTAR) after the heat shield on his Mercury spacecraft fails."
651,the-amazing-spider-man-movie,Agent_01,9,"defiantly worth t least a seven out of ten. I thought that no super hero movie I saw would seem any good after watching the avengers, but this while not as god as the avengers, is still a decent movie, and in my opinion better than the original. It is a worthy contender for the dark knight rise, but I don't expect it will be as good as that will. I can't really be bothered to go into detail"
652,birdman-or-the-unexpected-virtue-of-ignorance-movie,ealeyd,2,This is a hugely disappointing film - some funny lines but the overall whole is just not up to it. Very up itself and desperate to show how clever the filmmaker is
653,nine-movie,JeanR,0, Probably the worst movie that I have seen in many years.
654,the-gallows-movie,jossplacencia,0,"the worst movie ever, this is a  does not explain many things about the story, bad cast and the handcam is a old trick of this kind of movies that is boring now"
655,speed-racer-movie,StephenP,8," It boggles my mind how poor the ratings are for this movie. I've seen it twice already and cannot wait to purchase it on Blu-Ray when it comes out. I was very surprised by this movie - there was a lot more going on by way of serious themes in the movie. I enjoyed the camera work and the silliness of many parts. There was very little in this movie that I did not like. I don't want to push my opinion on anyone else, just take away from this - don't trust the reviews. If I am jaded (because I liked V for Vendetta a lot too) I guess I'm just glad that I could enjoy the movie."
656,teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movie,TheEpicSheep,1,"Ok, first things first: Who in gods name thought this would be a good idea!? Oh yeah! Michael Bay did! Did they keep anything interesting throughout this movie besides attracting COD players into this? No. Nostalgia? No, good writing? No! Oh, but at least the special effects are good! But that's all the movie has offers: Looks. Seriously, I counted how many clichés where in the script, how bad the writing was, and WHY IN THE UNHOLY HELL IS THIS ADVERTISED FOR KIDS!? ON NICKELODEON!? Michael Bay should be sued on using this license to help motivate kids into watching the TMNT Show.... Which by doing that is adding guns into it so they can get every 7 year old into loving it. This movie is garbage. Please, save yourself 10$ and don't watch. Your eyes might bleed. But hey, me and my friends where practically laughing on how bad it is so there's a comedy you can go see.... Minus the bad writing and well, everything this movie offers..."
657,kick-ass-2-balls-to-the-wall-movie,BUTCHYPIE,8,"Fun popcorn film.  Not necessarily as good as the first Kick Ass, but that was a hella-good movie and hard to equal. Well worth the ticket price and a good time. Wish they would have shown that photo of Nick Cage a few more times."
658,bobby-movie,JustinW.,0," a movie about the nations biggest elections, and some how hollywood managed to get the best and the most over rated actors and actresses to make a joke out of it. this movie was a sell out and I could not watch more than ten minutes of it. Great topic/subject for a movie but why for the love of anything that is holly hire the casting director to get the most ridiculous names to act in this movie. What a waste of time and/or money. This could have been a great movie but was wrecked by the casting. Boring not even stoned off my as$ could I watch this movie."
659,jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-movie,LamontRaymond,8,"What a breath of fresh air in this season of overly-serious, drudgery!  All the leads are hilarious, and the movie's got a heart (and a HART).  The Rock does amazing work."
660,the-sting-movie,MarcDoyle,10,"Absolutely one of my all-time favorites.  The acting, the music, the dialogue:  ""Do you want a percentage or flat rate?  Who's the mark?   Doyle Lannigan... Flat Rate...."""
661,the-bourne-legacy-movie,WriteFilmLive21,7,"Having never seen any of the previous ""Bourne"" films, I have a feeling there's a lot of background I'm missing out on here, especially in the first several minutes. However, on its own, it still stands as a very watchable action thriller. There are some true standout performances here, particularly from Rachel Weisz (damn, I need to check out more of her movies now), and I've become a quick fan of Jeremy Renner. The first and third acts were definitely the stronger points  the second felt like they dragged just a tad at moments, and as a rule I would have liked the action to be slightly less frenetic in its editing (though from what I understand, that's something of a Bourne staple). But I enjoyed it. Certainly not among the more impressive action flicks I've seen, but definitely not bad either."
662,one-day-2011-movie,gavmcg,9,"I'm shocked at how much justice this did to the book and for that, it's a hugely commendable film. The acting was fantastic and it's a major enjoyable Sunday evening film."
663,left-behind-2014-movie,Futuredirector,0,"Nothing's in disguise in Left Behind: A sorry script, an awful direction, and a bland storytelling. At the end, this is nothing else but a never-should-have-existed picture that messes Cage's filmography."
664,the-island-movie,ryancarroll88,1,"The movie takes a controversial biological/ethical issue and handles it with all the tact and seriousness of a Goosebumps serial. In the end its nothing more than a prolonged futuristic chase scenario with lots of color filtering (did they really have to make the ENTIRE movie look orange and blue?) It's a shame, because there were a lot of talented actors at work here..."
665,seven-pounds-movie,beeanadou,3,"The ending is really a tear-jerker but this movie is spreading so many wrong ideas about organ donating, and this is really impossible going to happen in real life. Besides, looking for redemption is the selling-point but can't those who are taking the pain of doing so live a good life?"
666,boyhood-movie,5thStFreddie,1,"Everyone knows this is a film made over 12 years, with the same cast - shot one week or so every year.  Other than that,  what's the story?  The mom has bad taste in men, the son has the worst hair cuts in history, and that fake, ""nobody understands me"" angst  that should pass for drama.   This is what's happening to American film - even the alleged good movies are awful.  This is a great film like what - On the Waterfront, To Kill a Mockingbird?  Amadeus, Chinatown?   It's like every year was written a different writer, or by Linklater trying to figure out what to do.  There's no central theme/plot or problem:  a story line that challenges, tears them apart, shows a real portrait of a family in the midst of struggle.   Nothing.  Without the 12 year gimmick, this film has nothing going for it.   Four of us, all film fanatics,  could not wait for it  to end."
667,harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-movie,asylumspadez,8,Probably the best film in the series. You not only see a huge increase in skill for the younger cast but you finally see them put the older cast members to some use. I think the long run time is pushing it a little though. The script doesnt really do that good of a job transitioning from book to film and it doesnt do a good job of explaining. Also I think Michael Gambon was a great addition for the re-casting of Albus Dumbledore.
668,the-dictator-movie,Mattyice,7,"Very funny and a good job by SBC/Aladeen. There were no truly dull parts of the movie. Always funny, no dull parts, an unpredictable ending. The movie was a little too short though. Much better than Bruno, but worse than Borat. If you like a good comedy, see this movie."
669,blood-money-movie,CameraBounceGod,1,i like the locations they used but the beginning scene which is a clip from the end kinda makes you think its gonna be a good one. this movie could have also been called cusack can't shoot at all. if this movie accomplished any good it would be proof that attractive women are greedy greedy and worse than snakes. but I already knew that and I hope everyone realizes. they dont care what happens to the world as long as they get to keep their high paying jobs they get through college and or their bags of money that they are going to use to pretend that they are better than everyone and be a hardcore lesbian and buy drugs. i wish that drugs didn't exist because they distract people from seeing or admitting the truth about attractive women.
670,devil-movie,savagejoe444,7,"'Devil' is basically the first ""Good"" M. Night movie I've seen in a while since 'Signs'. Though the horror wasn't really there, the rest was gold. Just wish M. Night could make something better than this, even though I like it, 'cause it appears to be his ""last"" good film he's making."
671,office-space-movie,Ralfbergs,8,"Nice movie, now might be considered one of the cult movies - had many fun things in it and maybe if I would have watched it around beginning of noughties, I might enjoy it even more. Either way it was still enjoyable with plenty of classic scenes in it."
672,rollerball-movie,SteveH,1, A real disappointment - I didn't expect a copy of the original but I didn't expect something to be this bad. I thought it might get better after a bad start - but it manages to go down hill all the way to the end. It is beyond belief that it could be rated a ten by anyone.
673,dogville-movie,PatP,10," To say that I was ""reluctant"" to watch this movie would be a massive understatement. I exerted a lot of effort in avoiding it as long as I possibly could, but once I was forced to watch it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I feel the critics far over-emphasize the cynicism of this movie and take it as an assault on all things Americana, but I perceived it as a surpisingly funny ultra dark comedy. While I expected it to be slow and depressing, it was actually slow and hilarious. Clearly, it's not for everyone, but if you can laugh at a little misery, then give this film a chance."
674,despicable-me-2-movie,DuckNation,7,A good movie but doesn't outdo it's predecessor well at least not right now maybe after a couple more watches then maybe it will. After the events in the first film Steve Carell (Gru) is done being a villain he now is just a family guy watching over his three daughters. He gets hired by a Anti-Villain League to track down and find this other villain. In this one Gru has a partner Kristen Wiig (Lucy Wilde) she was ok but didn't really see the point of her other then a type of love story but it's Kristen Wiig and i love her so i'm fine with it. The minions were awesome just like in the first film i love the little number at the end of the movie. Overall i give it a 7.7 will for sure be buying this on blu ray it has tons of laughs throughout the movie. Id recommend this to anyone that has little children also it's one of those kids movies that adults can watch without ripping out their eyes
675,lucy-movie,grandpajoe6191,7,"What happens when one can access the human mind to one's fullest extent? Luc Besson's ""Lucy"", despite its obvious plot holes and ridiculous ex machines, does show its own creative answer to the question as the film does manage to be a smart, ingenuous, and action-packed as it shows."
676,godzilla-2014-movie,alonso31mp,10,"This movie blows you up, the effects were tremendously good and the development of the story is so well handed. By far one of the best movies I've ever seen"
677,body-of-lies-movie,RicoS.,2," What's with all the distractions? Why is Crowe's character always doing five things at once while on the phone, coordinating CIA business? Because the phone-conversation isn't interesting enough in itself? Well, that's the problem with this movie: Over-sophisticating a simple story, replacing lack of script with chaos. It's just very annoying."
678,outbreak-movie,Meth-dude,7,"It's an actually really well made outbreak movie. Despite the clichés and the unnecessary happy ending, outbreak still managed to be quite entertaining and pretty fun to watch. The acting was great, the practical effects were great and the scenes were the virus is spreading are really well made and quite alarming. Outbreak might not be the best ""outbreak""movie, but it's still watchable."
679,the-notebook-movie,csw12,3,"This movie will leave you wondering, moreover, gasping, about why films like this are still made... A typical love story with the only surprise or mystery throughout the entire cliche infected plot.  Garbage film"
680,the-host-movie,Arman,3, No way is this so high on metacritic. I was burned into renting this. CGI is low budget!! Painful to watch at times. I eventually fast forwarded to end the misery.
681,the-amazing-spider-man-movie,finan,9,A great movie and much better than any of the previous films. Andrew Garfield seemed to fit into the role much better than Tobey Maguire ever did. A must see for summer 2012!
682,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,AztecHawk,9,"I'm glad they went in a new direction for this movie, that's something we were asking for since The Force Awakens. This movie expands the mythos of the Star Wars universe, the Force and the characters we thought we knew. It has its issues that's totally true, time will tell if this movie lives in infamy or high regard from the public, but personally I enjoyed it a lot."
683,all-is-lost-movie,chrisjones914,2,"Truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen! So so boring! Which is a complete shame because this movie had so much going for it! In the end, the only thing that was lost is what could have been a great film!"

685,avatar-movie,Tss5078,10,"People bashed it cause it was a big budget film and the focus of the previews and reviews were on the special effects, however this is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made, filled with hidden messages and real implications for our future. If you refuse to see it because it was a highly publicized blockbuster, than you are an idiot!"
686,tomorrowland-movie,Nstrong,8,"Brad Bird's Tomorrowland while not the spectacle everyone was hoping for, it was however a fun and exhilarating experience. I honestly didn't know what this movie would be like. I went into this movie not knowing the plot, not watching the trailers, and not reading any reviews. I wanted to go into this movie looking for a great story and likeable characters and that is exactly what I got. One of the first things you will notice with this movie is that the film looks beautiful and the cinematography is great. Geroge Clooney and Britt Robertson work together in a way that is unparreled in most of the big budget films today, but Tomorrwland is held down by uneven pacing. I will admit that the first and last twenty minutes are boring but not enough to make you disinterested. Ultimately, Tomorrowland fulfills what it was set out to do, bring us an enjoyable Sci-Fi flick fun for the whole family"
687,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Twigsy,0,"They completely butcher the force and disregard existing canon. It's among the best of Star Wars films (as a film), but it completely botches what makes Star Wars, Star Wars."
688,indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull-movie,peter,3," We already seen the great car chaches on a cliff, secret temples hidden in the rocks, and incredible non-human made objects that can change the world. This movie was just like a remake of all the different Indiana-Jones movies put together! this movie was disaproving!"
689,marley-me-movie,MarkMusic,10,"This means something I didnt even give my favorite movie a 10, first time. This is a lighthearted comedy/drama. Makes me cry every time at the end and Im 16. To me its more of a drama then comedy but either way very good movie. Great acting (humans and dog), great chemistry (mainly family-dog. then Family-family.) I brought the DVD in 2009 and I lost it in 2010. Im still desperatly looking for this. Probably the best film ever literally. Better then my fav movie not more entertaining but still better. Watch with family, alone, anytime, anywhere Its that good. But if your kids dont like sad endings cut it when the dog starts to act lazy. If they can handle it watch sad still very good though."
690,2012-movie,SwitSwat,9,"I definitely can't say that it was the best movie I had ever seen, but it was still a great watch! I don't know what's up with the other reviewers saying that it is ""total crap,"" but, everyone's got their opinions. Great special effects, and a good story. All the humor put into the movie made it better. Although, the acting was ok. Not terrible, but it was good. And, of course, the movie is totally unrealistic. Just like any other Sci-Fi/Fantasy movie. Unless you believe in 2012... But, I don't so... Again, pretty good movie. 9/10 from me."
691,capitalism-a-love-story-movie,TimS,0," Michael Moore never quite gets to the point in this movie, and that alone makes it worthless."
692,the-incredibles-2-movie,johnlemon04,7,"Good movie, i enjoyed it, but, the first one is much much better. The story (in the 1st one), the ambient, the plots, were just very interesting and realistic in a deep way.you really cared about the characters and villians on the first movie. Here, it just feels like a safe, easy going sequel. lacks of action, the antagonist is weak and predictable as hell. It has funny spots and moments, i like the redesing of the characters, the new ones look okayish, but, my problem goes with the plot, so bland, so safe, nothing really interesting to see after the first one. Pixar is going downfall since the last years, yes, deal with it, Pixar movies are not reaching their standars like before. Fun movie, entertaining, but, its bland and safe. I expected a better plot, ambient and structure here. 6.9/10"
693,watchmen-movie,WadeO.,9," To anyone complaining about the change to the minor deus ex machina of the film, grow up. Realize that the squid is simply there as a catalyst and changing that catalyst does not effect the importance of the moment. I was worried by all of the nay saying around this film until I was utterly astonished by the faithful wonder of it all. No punches were pulled and there is nothing left out that I felt was absolutely necessary. Here's to anticipation of the directors cut."
694,guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-movie,Thaddeus,1,"I hated the first one and thought they couldn't do any worse, I was wrong, they did. This film was horrible, hated everything but Chris Pratt, Kurt Russell, and Yondu. Worst movie of the year!"
695,kevin-hart-let-me-explain-movie,likacheetah,0,"Painful to watch. I have a serious issue with him thinking that his set on cheating on his wife was funny. It wasn't and it makes him look like a HUGE JERK. He starts off with it so the rest I spent the rest of his set angry that people like him exist, and literally did not laugh once. This whole video should be embarrassing for him. I loved his old stuff, but I can seriously say after watching this that I am no longer a fan. The only MILDLY redeemable part of the show was at the end when he was crying about being so grateful, and I say mildly because he SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL ENOUGH TO THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILDREN TO NOT CHEAT. I have laughed at cheating jokes before, I am not a comedy prude but he straight up said he didn't regret it and he would do it again. None of the jokes are funny when people don't like the person you are portraying yourself as."
696,king-kong-movie,TheProfitcy,0," If you like your action dumb, with all the chest banging, tribal stereotyping and logic destroying fun of the ""old time"" classics, you'll still find this movie, dumb, ignorant and pukifying. So excuse me, I must go puke just thinking about this piece of trash."
697,driven-movie,ASGaming21,0,"This one of the worst films I've ever watched. Terrible CGI, and crashes in every race. The explosions were from a Michael Bay film. And if those crashes were IRl, the drivers could be dead. I wonder what the F1 version would have been like"
698,whip-it-movie,jimmytancredi,7,"I really liked the cast! Very nice people gathered for the premiere of Drew Barrymore as a director. There are many cute scenes, some dialogue as well. But what attracts this movie, other than the cute Ellen Page, are the super forced performances of the girls. Drew and Juliette Lewis are very enjoyable to see. In addition, the Roller Derby is fun to watch because it has a lot of beating. I also loved the soundtrack. I think itâ"
699,race-to-witch-mountain-movie,MonteM,8," Fast action from the beginning, which is good for a family film, since children often become bored by too long of a slow moving character setup period. Dwayne Johnson does a great job of being a likeable tough guy for family films."
700,the-social-network-movie,mds03,10,"Such an interesting and entertaining movie. It wasn't boring in the slightest. All the actors were great. Justin Timberlake, Andrew Garfield and Jesse Eisenberg were especially good. Easily the best movie of 2010."
701,after-the-wedding-movie,AprilF.,8," A lovely movie, dramatic but not as melodramatic as some of the reviews suggest. Don't get me wrong - there's some major drama, but the characters are incredibly believable and their reactions are understandable and well-portrayed."
702,mortdecai-movie,TVJerry,2,"Johnny Depp is known for his eccentric interpretations, which can be marvelous or, in this case, an awkward flop. He plays an upper crust rogue and art scammer with a stupid moustache. There's an unoriginal plot about a stolen painting, but the focus is on his character's supposedly hilarious hijinks and clueless charms. NOT ONE JOKE lands and the supporting cast of impressive talent has taken his lead and avoided all attempts at being funny. The dry direction doesn't offer any help. A new low for Depp."
703,all-the-money-in-the-world-movie,Cinemaphile,2,"I took one for the team.   Purchased this on AmazonPrime Monday on double double discount.   Avoid this film.   If you'd like the whole story of the Getty Kidnapping, well acted and beautifully photographed, watch Trust on FX.   This film is poorly written and directed."
704,your-highness-movie,Bran7399,9,"High points for originality, no movie is quite like ""Your Highness"". Most people (especially the ""professional"" critics) don't seem to get that everything bad about the movie was done on purpose for comedic effect. From the bad British accents and bad acting to the bad writing and vulgarity, this was all part of the charm. Anyone with extensive movie watching experience should have picked up on this fact immediately, but I suppose critics aren't nearly as intelligent as they'd like us to believe. Or maybe they did pick up on it and were offended by it, because ""Your Highness"" doesn't just parody the medieval fantasy genre, it parodies all of cinema in a giant middle-finger to the industry, critics included. If you aren't self-aware enough to be able to laugh at yourself, I can see how this could get sand in your vagina. In conclusion, my review is less a critique of the movie and more a critique of the critics who just didn't get it. ""Your Highness"" was one of those stupid on purpose movies that flew over the head of, well, stupid people. And if you couldn't see past the stupid that was so blatantly on the surface that it almost knocked you over the head with the brilliance underneath, then I'm sorry, but yeah, you're  stupid."
705,live-with-it-movie,Efrain,10,"50/50 balances Drama and comedy perfect. I felt the drama of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character dealing with the cancer. The scenes that are supposed to give me a tearjerker gave it to me. The comedy that Seth Rogen gives are very funny and are delivered well. To me the fact that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is in this movie and as the lead role makes it even better. It's a great story, cast, and movie."
706,jackass-presents-bad-grandpa-movie,willkulka,2,"A horrible attempt at a candid comedy. Its slapstick humor and taboo behavior was the cause of, every movie-goer's worst nightmare, forced chuckles. It is so awful, you cannot look away. Unfortunately, one of the only movies I could not sit through."
707,avatar-movie,VincentP,10," James Cameron's Avatar is one of the most important American films ever made. It pushes into the mainstream many concepts that we must embrace as a society in order to survive on a planet we are slowly destroying. To see another film with a very similar theme check out Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke. Human's arrive on a planet named Pandora and discover that under a village of indigenous humanoids is a rare mineral they want called ""obtainium"". This is the MacGuffin of the plot. James Cameron makes this an obvious joke because he wants us to know that the real motivation for the corporate and military types of the film is man's urge to destroy and kill. The concept of the film is that a few humans are given the chance to inhabit Avatars which are living simulacrums of the Navi(again Mr. Cameron is making a joke, Navi being a compression of native). The main character, Jake takes to his new body and learns all the secrets of the planet. Unlike Earth, where we can't actually link our minds to other living creatures, The Navi can actually entwine a part of their bodies with other animals and plants and share direct communication with the ecosystem. They rightly believe that all life is connected. If I have one complaint it's that Mr. Cameron has the natives call their planet goddess Eewa which reminds me of Ewoks which reminds me of the beginning of the decay of George Lucas' creative talents. The last hour of the film is standard action film and love story but done extremely well. Since this is a Fantasy the good guys win and send the military and corporate greed-heads packing. Why am I talking about this film on my Dog Blog? Because for the last half dozen years I've been trying to figure out what life is about and partnering up with my dog this last year has made me even more aware that all life is precious. I may even try to overcome my revulsion of spiders and insects and try to capture and release them when I find them in my house. The smartest person I ever met (PHD from Cambridge University) once told me about the Gaia Theory. She said earth is a living organism and we have become a disease on it's surface. Earth has had life on it most likely since the point when the surface cooled enough for liquid water to form. There is four billion years of DNA research under Gaia's belt and when we reach the point where she can no longer bear us a virus will emerge that will wipe us out. Maybe we can learn to co-exist with Gaia but we haven't gotten there yet."
708,dreamgirls-movie,JossalynnM.,10," This movie was phenomenal! I enjoyed every actor's performance, however, I thought Jennifer Hudson's performance was stellar. I am impressed with her acting as well as her powerhouse singing and look forward to seeing more of her on the big screen."
709,walk-the-line-movie,BrennanS.,10, Gripping and powerful.
710,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Merr,8,"My message to Rian Johnson:First 40 minutes - fk off palRest of the movie - love you, but next time drop the occasional jokesIf it wasn't for the Lego Star Wars-like jokes for me it easliy would have been best movie in the main saga. When it relases on BD i am making my own version with all the jokes cut out."
711,black-panther-movie,twkonefal,3,"I have a hard time reconciling the plight against racism and with the goals of the ""Wakanda peoples"" to go out into the world and help when the Wakandan's call white people they've never met ""colonizers"" with derision. If Wakandan's are so isolated, why do they act like Americans? This is in very poor taste, not that the rest of the movie was especially good. There was really no innovation in the story and the plot was predictable and bland."
712,man-of-steel-movie,Mudget,3,"It kind of breaks my heart to see anyone give this movie a high rating, it means that two-dimensional,  formulaic movies are more important than character and story.  And when you're talking about an iconic character like Superman, I think that's almost a crime.  From the get-go, when CGI monsters are attacking Krypton, I knew things were off.  The introduction of an ""S"" as meaning something Kryptonian is also just silly.  There's not even a breath of the Clark Kent many of us grew up reading and watching in film and movies  this is a total 'reimagining'  this Kent is charmless and dour, and ruled largely by fear in this movie.  Fear of being found out, fear of being different.  A Superman crafted of these elements tells a totally different story  it was never Superman's though.  It was Batman's, Spider-Man's, and a ton of other heroes, but never Superman's.  The dialogue is so stiff and cheesy, which might work in a comic-book interpretation  but here they're trying to make Superman into something emo and pouty, so it just comes off as contrived.  The effects are okay and the action works, but that's where all the attention went  and for a movie about the origins of a superhero, such a lack of character development is surprising.  Then there's just stuff like people wandering around in arctic climates in just a coat, no problem  that sort of thing.  But the biggest sin of this movie is that instead of being thoughtful, soulful fun built around very solid characters, like the Christopher Reeve movies, this one tries to make huge over-the-top action sequences be the 'fun' part.   I just feel it falls short on so many levels.  We're not supposed to think of Superman as badass.  We're supposed to think of him as our greatest advocate and defender  a man of unwavering character who doesn't have to think twice about motive or intent.  He always does the right thing, the good thing.  He's SUPERMAN.  Here he's just an 'every guy' trying to make it in this world with superpowers.  Superman was always bigger than that.  It is in fact what set him apart from all the Spider-Mans, Wolverines, Green Lanterns, Avengers, etc etc etc.  Oh sure, he played cat-and-mouse with his identity (a single pair of glasses magically managed that for him for decades), but I don't think the intent of the story was ever to feel bad about his role, almost like he's a victim.  Superman always was, and always should be, a representative of the opposite of that  he's the guy who never thinks twice about his role or place and just always strives to do what's right by the human race  and does it with a smile.  All while being a nerdy reporter on the side.  I don't know where any of this went."
713,speed-racer-movie,ChristopherF.,9, I could sit down and pretend that stringing together multisyllabic adjectives that just happen to wreck into a noun constitutes a professional opinion or I could just tell you it's a fun movie provided you're not over the age of 40 and write film reviews for a living.
714,spider-man-3-movie,KenJ.,8," Overall it was ok, the ending just didn't make any sense. [SPOILERS] The villians become these big soft wussies. They killed off the enemy way too quickly(Venom). Yes lots of cheesy moments but it is after all a movie that was based off of the comics which were just as cheesy and the first two films had corny scenes as well. It tends to get a bit confusing with all the characters being introduced at once, they probably should have just stuck with venom and the new goblin. The ""depressed"" peter parker was a joke, wasnt necessary. The fight scenes were pretty good, sandman appears about 10 mins in the movie just like venom...the fight at the end is about the best part of the movie, not the best movie but not the worst either, if you can live through the corny lines and all the lovey dovey bullsh.t."
715,fury-movie,AxeT,3,"What a bore!  Pitt is solid, but most critically it's very weak on story.  Authenticity suffers since the makers were probably brought up on Star Wars they include lasers in a WWII film.  There were tracers sure, but nothing like this.  Artistic license to be pretty pictures?  Fine, but the geek factor basically threw realism out the window.  The supporting cast is too mannered in their performances.  Michael Peña is not such a great actor who certainly is making bank playing the token Mexican in every other movie out there.  Note to Hollywood:  it begins to take an audience out of a story with this kind of over-saturation."
716,abduction-movie,JFK,1,I don't understand how such an amazing cast could surround Taylor Lautner and still leave him looking so wooden. Completely disappointing. Gaping continuity errors.
717,paycheck-movie,xahkdlys119,10,"I think that this movie has many twists and turns that is enough to keep people on the edge of their seats. And it surely has something to tell. It mentioned that predicting the future is something that we should not try to do. After all, I think that this is a very nice movie."
718,the-cloverfield-paradox-movie,concernedfan,3,"Oh dear. Every character seems to be in a different movie. Hamilton is in Gravity, Bruhl &amp; Zhang are in a bad Alien rip-off, and O'Dowd is in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The stitches connecting this collection of cockpit and hallway shots to the Cloverfield universe are obvious and clumsy, and the attempt to add a Cloverfield twist to the end is telegraphed so clearly that it's no fun at all. Oh well. Hope this doesn't kill the franchise; first two were loads of fun."
719,the-lincoln-lawyer-movie,kingshahid,8,I really enjoyed how the movie followed the lawyer around. The ending could have been more interesting with a few more twists or a settling end but it ended seemingly in the middle of following along intensely. Some of the twists it did have were very obvious as in the mother being the shooter. Going into the law field may have swayed my positive reaction to the film which was more of a drama than a thriller. Exploited some of the real-life situations that may exist.
720,safe-house-movie,JAL,2,What a disappointment! I don't see how Denzel Washington could associate himself with such a low-quality production
721,frances-ha-movie,StephBonn,3,"Worst ""critically acclaimed"" film of the year.I walked out, which I haven't done in a very long time. The last one was ""Greenberg""...ok, so maybe there's a pattern... "
722,blood-diamond-movie,abi_abhiabi,10,wow i'm just spell bound after watching this movie.. this movie is long but you will never feel that it is long.. it has so much intense in what it shows.. the actions scenes are entertaining and also the movie tells something which we are not aware of.. and leonardo is just amazing.. Djimon Hounsou is just great.. this is movie is something which everyone have to watch.. thumbs up!
723,no-country-for-old-men-movie,ChrisW.,10," Easily surpasses the high expectations one would take away from any review. Thought provoking, haunting,unforgettable, this movie is easily the best of the year, a shoe in for an Oscar under best picture catergory, and a possible candidate for AFI's next updated 100 films list."
724,solo-a-star-wars-story-movie,gonzalitodelanu,0,"The worst MOVIE EVER!!! really. Please... don't go to the cinema... Disney, no more star wars movies please."
725,shutter-island-movie,MrWolf,2," [Spoilers] do not read if you are going to watch this This was a pathetic movie. The ending is SOO telegraphed its unreal. The movie opens with him going on and on about hating water for some reason - then you find out that they are looking for someone who drowned her kids. hmmm. the ""brand new partner"" thing. When they interview the patients and the patients make a point of glancing over at the ""new partner"" when the missing doctor is mentioned. and this is in the first half. The last half is a long plodding walk to be disappointed."
726,cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-movie,MattB,1," I'm the average commenter here and I hated the movie because it was TOO KIDDY and needed more sexual/violent content to keep my bad self satisfied. I am an adult after all, and too ""mature"" to enjoy something simple, innocent, and directed at the unwashed youth of America."
727,hercules-the-thracian-wars-movie,Peabarter,8,"The Rock plays a great action hero and does it again here.  This won't win an Oscar, but if your looking for Hercules to flex his muscles and clobber anyone who gets in his way, you will get what you want.  Two things would have made the movie better, more mythology and a strong villain, but I can't talk about that without spoiling the movie.  I would love to see the Rock do either a 2 movie run or a trilogy with the 12 labors broken up into the films.  Don't let the nay sayers dissuade you from going to this one."
728,the-grudge-movie,[Anonymous],2," Give it an extra 2 for nice horror, but for the rest, I call it trash, very bad plotting."
729,superman-returns-movie,FedUp,0," With a budget of over 200M how in the world can they make a movie that has no plot, no directing, no real dialogue, and wooden indians for actors? If this isn't bad enough it takes about an hour and a half before anything significant happens. By then the movie has lost the audience and only gets more amateurish by the minute. It's ridiculous that about 1.75M of the budget is wasted on CGI which is nothing more than a fancy video game. If any of these yahoo's giving this joke of a movie a ten can honestly say that this is a perfect flick than either I'll show you a kid with ADD or a moron who checked his brains in at the door or had a lobotomy. This is a disgrace and boring as hell. Where do the studio's find these yahoo's who waste their money. I love Superman as much as the next person but it is the end of the line for me. Terrible effort all the way around."
730,the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-movie,RealMuthaF,7,"I'm not a big fan of Tolkien and the original trilogy and I've read the book a very long time ago, so guess I'm being impartial here. I've definitely enjoyed the movie, it's well-filmed (no wonder in that), but it suffers from one thing, and that'd be the book being split into three separate movies. Not just that, but three two-and-half-hour-long movies. As a result, the story gains a bunch of unnecessary and often uninteresting details and the beginning feels awkwardly slow, the first half an hour of the film could easily be shortened thrice or so. But once the beginning's over, you'll get immersed in the world of Middle Earth. Another thing is I think that Bilbo is actually a better protagonist than Frodo - he's brave, modest and funny, another great performance by Martin Freeman. Anyway, it's a really good fantasy movie you definitely wouldn't wanna miss."
731,eragon-movie,InvdrShadowPony,0,"NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!This is unacceptable. How could you mess this movie up so badly? Really? The book was amazing and even better when you notice that it was made by someone who wasn't even 18 yet. But... How? How do you make this movie THIS bad? If I point out ever single detail, we'll be here all day, so I'll just do a few.The acting was bad. Bad. Terrible. No one knew how to act. The visuals where very ""Eh."" They spent it all on a few individual shots. The story was utter crap. It jumped around way too much and never made sense. It still doesn't make sense if you read the book. Like how Saphira could fly into the sky and suddenly become a fully-grown dragon at the start of the film.It was so far off from the original book (like how the Ra'zac where... Whatever the hell they were, how... Everything about Brom was executed or how they made Eragon seem like a Disney princess) that I couldn't believe it was even kind of related. Even if it was it's own thing without the book, it would still be the worst film of all time. I would rate it -1 out of 999,999,999 if I could, but sadly, I can only rate it a zero out of ten."
732,the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-movie,Stealthgear,9,"This is a good mystery with an excellent human story that imprints itself onto the viewer in ways that have never been done before. Noomi Rapace nails her role and far exceeds what most american actresses are capable of, especially in a physical sense. Cinematics in this movie are good and the locations are adequate. This movie is not amped up in any Hollywood way, it just focuses on the who-dunnit story and the book's characters. Specific details created for the characters and world they live by the book's author are truly unique and come alive through dedicated actors. I appreciated the detail and uniqueness of this movie a lot and would watch it again. Who needs an amped up Hollywood version when all you really need is Noomi Rapace?!! A."
733,three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-movie,VirgonoShaka,8,"This movie left me with a very conflicted array of feelings, which I can say means that it really fulfilled its purpose. With some amazing performances (two oscar winners), and some fantastic scenes that make you feel everything from confusion, compassion, empathy, disgust, sadness, anger, and even happiness, I can say that this is great movie worthy of very high praise. Fair warning though, if you don't like heavy movies, this may not be your cup of tea."
734,walle-movie,LarryP.,3," Very dissappointed. Left my kids (ages 5 and 7)completely confused, and me with a bitter taste in my mouth. I not interested in paying $10 for lecture on enivornmental issues....especially when trying to make them seem funny."
735,the-fighter-movie,DKay,8,"Solid story of redemption. The climatic boxing footage is surprisingly real...like real-real. I found myself pumping my fist after Ward landed his vintage left hook to the body. Still, despite as the world has told you already, Bale's (again) masterful transformation, I wasn't knocked out (call it an 8-count though)....Like I wanted to be. Gatti-Ward 2 was better. Props to David O'Russell though for admirably adding to the VERY short list of excellent sports films that aren't really about sports. Plus that pot shot at Belle Epoque...classic."
736,life-of-pi-movie,Nekosan,10,"The most beautiful film, especially because the treatment on the story and the image is so delicate, it's a jewel and a metaphoric journey.

But this movie is so terrible that I have to warn you people. From the lackluster action sequences where all Ghost Rider has to do to defeat his foes is swing his chains to Nicholas Cage's simply loony acting this movie truly offers nothing to us. I am a huge superhero movie fan and slightly enjoyed Ghost Rider 1. DONT EXPECT THEM TO MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THE PREVIOUS MOVIE. Except for the fact it's Nicholas Cage, there is no connection. THis movie's story is a consistent set of plotholes so gaping and awkward that the extreme nerd on you is going to cry blood.  Nothing after the credits. The visuals in this movie would be GREAT for a grad student's portfolio reel but the times they selected to use the over-the-top imagery are ill-fitting. Maybe it's because ghost-rider himself is a crappy hero to have a movie about but if this movie was a kitten I would not pet it."
741,the-wolf-of-wall-street-movie,roman_emperor,9,"I just watched The Wolf on Wall Street and I must say, the movie is outrageously hilarious. Despite it's excessive promotion of drugs and its misogynistic theme, which I don't condole, the movie deserves merits for its whit and dark sense of humor. If you don't take it too serious, you won't get offended by its themes. Frankly, I love it, and I'm interested in tasting ""non-alcoholic"" beer."
742,valhalla-rising-movie,Nathonas,8,"The film may appear simple and boring to some, but its depth lies in the cinematography and themes."
743,adventureland-movie,AndyM,0," This movie was nothing like what it was advertised to be. It was slow and boring. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but there was but two funny scenes, and they were lacking. The characters were way undeveloped, the plot was predictable from page one, and the whole thing was completely pointless. Avoid this low-budget artsy wanna-be piece and just go watch juno or something."

The movie is really a great adaptation - Willem DaFaoe is incredible as the super-weird counterfeiter, and William Peterson is off the chain as a treasury agent.  Great to see him go wild before his CSI days.  An easy recommendation for fans of Miami Vice."

Leonardo did his part great.however,the script the story is hardly acceptable,let alone winning an Oscar award. I don't like racism but what the film had portrayed is not only challenging  the slavery transaction in the 1800s,but also delivery a contemptuous attitudes to both laws and human rights."
747,superman-movie,gameguardian21,8,"This is the one superman movie we can all love. This was the one superman movie that everyone wanted to having an inspiring super hero to have one of the greatest superman movie and probably the best superman movie of the late 70""s early 80""s."
748,kick-ass-movie,RyanK.,0," The first half of this movie is great. It's very faithful to the comic, and sets everything up really well. The second half of the movie is an abomination. It completely ruins the point of the comic. It's supposed to be about what would happen if people dressed up as super heroes in the real world. Apparently the director got bored with this theme and decided he wanted to make an actual super hero movie, complete with magical jet packs with shoulder mounted chain-guns. If you've read the comic, stay far far away. If you haven't read the comic, you might enjoy this movie a little more. I suggest reading the comic instead though. It's much better."
749,domino-movie,ElaineM.,9," Loved it! Visually stunning, well-acted, well-written, beautifully directed, moments of humor. Convoluted, yes, but so were many great films (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects come to mind). If you pay attention to detail, you'll have no problem following it."
750,beauty-and-the-beast-2017-movie,coltonjames,7,"After Disney’s live-action remakes of Cinderella and The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast has a lot to live up to. It must take their (arguably) most popular animated film and transition it for modern audiences. With a cast consisting of mostly inanimate objects and a minotaur-like brute, director Bill Condon had a difficult task ahead of him. Thankfully, he was more than up for the challenge. Beauty and the Beast, for the most part, is a success despite some major flaws in its leads. A selfish prince, Dan Stevens, is doomed to live as a hideous beast, unless he finds true love. In walks Belle, Emma Watson, as the prince’s cursed staff makes a last-ditch effort for the prince to free them of their enchantment and find true happiness. I never believed in the relationship between Belle and the Beast. They didn’t have any chemistry until the final act of the film and it felt rushed. Watson and Stevens were serviceable in the leading roles, but unlike the rest of the cast, they felt replaceable. For most of movie, neither are given much to do. Watson seemed present in her scenes and that’s about it. She never felt charming or had any depth to her. Stevens was never intimidating as the Beast, and I didn’t have as much sympathy for him as I should have. Fortunately, the rest of the ensemble cast more than makes up for the lacking leads. Luke Evans and Josh Gad are perfectly cast. Evans shines as the incredibly narcissistic yet immensely likeable Gaston, while Gad’s take on the quirky and bumbling LeFou has the funniest moments of the film. The performance of “Gaston” was easily the best part of the movie. The nefarious duo steal each scene they’re in and I left the movie wishing they had more screen time. A lineup of all-time greats, including Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson and Stanley Tucci, make up the enchanted staff. Each actor and actress gives a larger than life performance and they all work great, with Ewan McGregor being the standout with his excellent rendition of “Be Our Guest”. The musical numbers drew me in and never felt out of place. Iconic songs such as “Beauty and the Beast” were done with admiration and were satisfying to see onscreen. Director Condon utilizes epic set designs and sweeping shots of beautiful landscapes to make Beauty and the Beast feel like a fairy tale come to real life. The tone is light-hearted, but dark when it needs to be. I would be laughing at a joke from LeFou in one scene, and feel deep sorrow for the cursed inhabitants of the castle in the next.  It is a delicate balance that gives the film its emotional depth. The visual effects of the film are, for the most part, decent if not passable. However, the Beast looks near realistic in some scenes, but cartoonish in many others. It can be distracting when it appears Emma Watson is acting against something that isn’t as real as her. Despite some key character flaws and minor inconsistencies, I found Beauty and the Beast to be Disney’s best live-action remake yet. I was invested in the enchanted staff’s desperate attempt to make Belle fall for the Beast, and I had great time watching Gaston’s smug endeavors to woo Belle. The fun-spirited tone and energetic performances of the supporting cast left me feeling cheerful as I exited the theater. Disney keeps setting the bar higher and higher with its remakes, and they keep delivering."
751,fast-five-movie,bfoore90,10,"Best entry in this series, hands down. This film does a good job of representing of where the franchise is going to go and makes no bones about what you're going to get with an awesome, adrenaline fueled performance by The Rock to add some much needed adversary to Dominic Torreto. The villian in this movie is bar average when compared to The Rock but its still satisfies you enough to watch him get shot and die even though the execution was very quick and is quickly forgotten. The heist scenes are pure gold for action fans and the end does enough to satisfy long time fans, overall its a good, fun movie."

I just want to be happy in this life. If I'm telling this to you... you will think that... I am some sort of beast... or devil. I am all of these things... but I also having mother... father... brother and sister once. They loved me"". The story is about a young child in an unnamed African country learns to become a soldier under the tutelage of a Commandant. Beasts of No Nation is shocking, powerful, heartbreaking and scary to watch sometimes. Cary Fukunaga brilliantly directed this movie and he's also the same director of the first season of True Detective (Just in case you didn't know). Idris Elba delivers a menacing performance that's one of his best. Abraham Attah stole the show for me, I mean he was so freaking brilliant in this movie and he deserves an Oscar nomination (In my opinion). The movie is shocking and very real with some of the scenes which I liked, because it never hold anything back and not once tried the Hollywood way of getting out of danger. Movies like this are great examples of film making. Now for the flaws: I liked this movie, but I honestly can't see myself watching it again. It's one of those movies that you think it's good and well made but never again will you see yourself re-watching it. But that's just me and who knows, you may have watched more than once. Overall Beasts of No Nation is a chilling and depressing war drama that really gets to you. The performances, the visuals and the shocking scenes in this movie are unforgettable."
756,flight-movie,Summersausage,8,This movie actually surprised me. I thought it was going to be like Flightplan with Denzel but it actually was a sustainable thought out drama instead of a three star action movie. It was a great feat of showing alcoholism in a negative light with an interesting story line. Not incredible but a very good movie that will get some critical acclaim.
757,sucker-punch-movie,HaVoK308,1,What a waste. Clearly ruined by attempting to cash in on a larger audience by going cheesy and  out with a PG-13 rating. This director just lost all credibility by selling out. Don't waste your time with this one.
758,transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-movie,StevenF,3,"There is just no way to defend or salvage the massive and overblown mess that is Revenge of the Fallen, the sequel to the equally big but not equally bad Transformers film in 2007. Clocking in at two and a half hours, this is a drag and then some, with an uneven and completely exhausting plot that twists and turns into senseless action, it becomes quite difficult to follow and, well, unnecessary. To many devices, turning points and pointless additions make up this bloated sequel, where we find Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) now heading to college, but being dragged back into the fight of the Transformers. The Decepticons, or the bad guys, have found a new energy source, and it's location lies within the mind of Sam, and that's really the plot that drags out for an obscenely long time, and the humour and mediocre storytelling, it goes one way by the Decepticons reveal themselves the world and how they will no longer hide, but yet their epic showdown happens in the desert, away from the.. erm.. public eye. These ongoing problems persist throughout the film, as the script seems to contradict itself at many turns, switching locations and using cut-off scenes at what are perceived to be  pivotal moments such as the resurrection of Megatron, but lets cut to Sam's parents trying out snails in Paris. The inconsistencies simply don't diminish, whether its these symbols that are the driving point of the film, why exactly where these missing from the first film, with only subtle hints that never amounted to anything. The humour can be the saving grace of the film, but low and behold we have teo particularly stereotyped Autobots who are now part of of Optimus Prime's  team of earth dwellers who are reminiscent of the gang culture persona of African-Americans, racist and desperate are words that spring to mind. We also have new lady autobots who I'm sure have around five words to say in the entire film, its been made big, but just too big to point where there are mistakes and forgetfulness.LaBeouf continues to bicker his way through his lead role, perhaps trying to encapsulate a character with an attention disorder. There is very little do to for the rest of the cast, some having petty one-liners while others are kicked to the dirt entirely. The special effects are again a truly amazing to watch, but a compromise needs to be drawn somewhere, and there is none in this film, its loud and utilises slow-motion so we can watch Sam and Michaela (Megan Fox) run away several times, and leap from buildings onto piles of rubble without any sort of injury.There is no consistency, motive, relatable actions or fluid plot points to admire this film, instead we are left with a loud and over-arching catastrophe. Michael Bay should have listened to the dialogue that John Turturro delivers on the film, ""beginning, middle, end, plot, condense  If only."
759,hansel-and-gretel-witch-hunters-movie,Leo9127,2,"This movie is a guilty pleasure to me, that's why it isn't rated lower, but sadly Jeremy Renner is wasted once again, the witches look awful, and the acting is even worse, still you might wanna check it out if you're drunk."
760,schindlers-list-movie,AkashVijay,3,"Sappy, manipulative and a ridiculously oversimplified version of the Holocaust.Spielberg has made a name for himself in the film industry by reducing serious subjects to the lowest denominator until it's no more than any mawkish family melodrama. Why should a movie about the Holocaust be any different? Schindler's List is an aesthetic mess and exemplifies everything that's wrong about Hollywood.First off, the movie's primary focus is to show us how Oscar Schindler, a slave owner aiming to run his factories through jew labour for monetary profit, turns into a defender of jews' rights and the protector of their lives. But the problem is Schindler's transformation is portrayed in an extremely poor way. In fact, there is no transformation. Midpoint in the film, the Schindler persona has disappeared, and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the Jew workers. How did we get from one to the other?And then we have Amon Goeth. He's an evil, sadistic, Jew-hating Nazi - but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning, takes a swig of booze and snipes Jew prisoners for fun? No. Spielberg thinks the answer is obvious -- he's a Nazi, and Nazis don't have reasons for the things they do. The attempt to add depth to Göeth's character by dwelling on his twisted love affair with a Jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap exposure of Nazi hypocrisy. The true intrigue, the true horror of the Holocaust does not lie in brutality alone, but rather in Hannah Arendt's ""banality of evil"". How can a man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family?Another problem is the accent. There are English-speaking films and then there are German-speaking films. Schindler's List, on the other hand, does not belong to either of these categories. One of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. When Schindler took off his gold ring and blubbered ""I could have saved one more"", I experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. Spielberg's invariable resort to sentimentality is quintessentially Hollywood, quintessentially cheesy and quintessentially inappropriate for the subject matter of the film. Schindler's List is technically brilliant but Spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision. His moral and intellectual depth is that of a child (and the funny part is Schindler's List may be the most mature movie Spielberg has made till now)."
761,battle-royale-2000-movie,Meth-dude,8,"It's a very well made action movie. Despite it's rather silly plot and over the top violence, the movie managed to feel real and you actually cared for some of the characters.

With more than okay acting performances, strong and very well made action sequences and interesting characters, Battle Royale is a solid movie."

764,children-of-men-movie,DamienDarko777,10,"I'd have to say this is one of the best science fiction movies ever made. The cinematography, the performances, the music, the story, everything about it excels. The director convincingly presents a bleak near-future where humanity has gone infertile and is slowly dying out. Add in gut-wrenching action scenes, a particularly wonderful performance by Michael Caine, and an anti-fascist subtext, and you have a brilliant humanistic tale."
765,the-croods-movie,Rainbow_Lizard,3,"The plot was incredibly predictable, the comedy was bad and the pacing was way too fast during the first three quarters. The film was not creative, the extent of the creativity being animal  other animal/plant. The characters to me were annoying and the majority were completely static, with the exception of Grugg and Eep. After the Tar pit scene, the plot becomes a lot less predictable, and the pacing is better, but I still couldn't care about them. The conflicts were born out of pure stupidity, and there were plenty of plotholes to go around. (Where are the trees? You can't simply survive on eggs you have to risk death to get. At least kill the bloody things.)"
766,the-book-thief-movie,Aquaris475,9,"The Book Thief is one of the best books I've read, and thankfully, the same can be said for the film adaptation. The Book Thief mainly succeeds thanks to its acting. Each actor nails it as their characters perfectly, and delivers the perfect amount of emotion and dialogue. It's some of the best acting I've ever seen in a film. the writing does a great job of sticking to the book. While there are obviously differences, and things outright taken out, the majority of the writing keeps true to the book. Even though I don't deduct points for accuracy, I was impressed with how well it did towards the original novel. Even without the book accuracy, the writing and script were excellent. When it comes down to it, my only problems with the film is the safe approach and inconsistency. The film does decent with its Nazi Germany setting, but plays with it way too safely. It seems like they tried not too mess with such a setting, and because of it, it feels like the Nazi setting is approached a bit too brightly, except for a select few scenes. But the biggest problem is the inconsistency. Death narrates the movie, just like he does the book, but the problem here is that he's used a few times, and at random. It makes me wonder what the point of bringing Death into the film was, because his random use feels seriously off. Aside from this problem, The Book Thief does excellent thanks to its strong acting and great direction, and I'd definitely recommend you see it."

From the looks of the DVD case, it looked like it would be action packed but I thought wrong. This was actually the worst movie I have ever seen ever; MUCH worse than the cheesiest Sci-fi channel movie you've ever seen, and worser than a ""booty shaking"" video on youtube. This movie just fails ar everything; it had a intriguing thing in mind(mysterious infertility in the human race) but they didn't have anything to show for it in the actual movie. The one pregnant woman is running away from people, to who knows where, and when they get there, they continue running..When the finally escape to wherever they are trying to get to, the movie cuts off..Seriously, I wish I could unwatch this movie, get my money back, and make sure no one else has to watse their time with this bull. If anyone should think this movie is good in any kind of way except being absolute crap, this must be the first piece of ""entertainment"" they have ever come in cotnact with.

778,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Guymaru,0,"Embarrassing. Pure ego service for the director. Rian Johnson took 7 films of story, and broke that story in a single film. Most of the tropes from the 7 movies - broken. Strong story elements from Abrams revitalisation of Star Wars - broken. Johnson came into this film like a spoiled child breaking other people’s toys. In the process of “making it his own” Johnson dismissed much of what is good in Star Wars. Furthermore, the story as a one-off was incredibly weak. A “chase scene” that took the WHOLE film. Introduction of a mediocre new character at the expense of character development for established characters. Bringing an immensely self-pitying Luke back in order to turn him into a force ghost. Flying Leia. Snoke as a non-entity. And is Finn an interesting character anymore? From the perspective of story it’s incredibly weak. In terms of spectacle it’s strong - reminding me of...prequels. I hope Disney takes note of the fan response. It will take a number of books and comics to make Johnson’s “story” work for Abrams to build on. Abrams is a miracle worker in terms of bringing back beaten, broken stories - but I’m not sure even he can salvage this. May the force be with him. I really hope Disney reconsiders Johnson for a trilogy..."

786,brother-bear-movie,PaulaW.,8," The poor reviews are hard to understand. Brother Bear is a kid's movie, and as a kid's movie it is great. It's got endearing characters, lots of cute animals, and gorgeously animated scenery. The moose provide comic relief, and the moral of the story is a nice lesson about maturity. Just one caveat: the hunting scenes were a little too intense for the 27-month old who saw it with me, even though there is no actual gore. Oh, and the Phil Collins songs are skippable. I actually enjoyed this more than The Lion King, which to me seemed to be trying too hard to bring the adults in with a story that nevertheless remains kiddie-level. I also liked it better than Shrek, which just annoyed me with its precocious attempt at hipness. It was more heartwarming and aesthetically pleasing than Ice Age. It didn't have the clever charm of Lilo and Stitch, but I don't think kids really need that. There's plenty of time for cleverness and snark later in life. Let kids be kids - take them to see Brother Bear. "

The original Poseiden Adventure was released in 1972 and started a Hollywood trend of big budget disaster films most of which became huge movie-for-the-masses fodder. It has taken 34 years, but Hollywood has finally put the nail in the coffin of the disaster epic by making the absolute worst remake in film history! They should have sold this movie as a remake of Airplane because it is so (unexpectedly) funny that I give it one point only for Kurt Russell's hilarious Shelley Winters impersonation as he swims and swims, holding his breath under water, trying to reach the on/off switch control panel for the enormous engines of the ocean liner(and the control panel is, amazingly, functioning underwater also).

795,the-amazing-spider-man-2-movie,PulseEnder,8,"The Amazing Spiderman 2 is the sequel to 2012's Amazing Spiderman, a reboot of the Spiderman film franchise. While the movie is definitely summer blockbuster material, it goes into a completly different story direction then its predecessor. While the first one seemed to give audiences a true feel for Peter's identity as not only a vigilante but as a human character, this movie throws a ton of subplots at you that it just feels kindof hard to feel bad for the protagonist when he falls into the breakup makeup cog trap with his girlfriend Gwen who just doesn't give off the same charm she does in the original. When the Electro plot begins, the story doesn't feel as tragic as it does pathetic. The obsessive personality over Spiderman as well as the ridiculous buisness ethics of Oscorp make you wonder whether your supposed to feel bad for this guy, or that you should think he is the dumbest movie villian you've ever seen in a non-comedic summer blockbuster. When Harry reunites with Peter, he also becomes somewat obssessed with Spiderman making him and Electro two desperate cliche movie villians that want some guy dressed in a spiderman costume to save them from their insanity. Oh by the way, when Harry takes a turn for the worst, the movie fails to explain why he becomes so messed up, it absolutely does not explain the whys or how he shows up to kickstart the movie into a climax, all we know is that he plays cliche mad scientist. Don't get me started on the Rhino, he doesn't even fight Spiderman, he is the result of false adverstising one hundred percent. If you want to see everything the Rhino does in the movie, watch any of the trailers and you will know. I liked the pace of the movie and the visuals, the randomness as well, but that is me, I know that this movie should have had a deeper plot and fulfilled its promise to truly have Spiderman fight three villians let alone not fight one. This feels like a sizzle reel that I enjoyed watching because I love Spiderman but it is just an exploit of movie culture, that is: ""Spiderman will fight three badass villians in a sequel to the reboot with the villians played by a well ranged and talented cast of Paul Giamatti, Jamie Foxx, and Dan Dehaan."" And that is what made me unhappy with the movie, it didn't even deliver the main goods it promised, and also left us with a stupid cliffhanger and machete plot. Reccomend it for everyone because everyone loves a spiderman movie, but this movie is really one random piece of work that has enjoyable moments scattered throughout a movie of ridiculous and redundant plot devices and cheap false marketing tactics."

798,the-avengers-2012-movie,JustinChuck,0,"Stunning movie! Thumbs up to Mr Whedon and Mr Marvel who know how to put together a blockbuster, and for all you marvel followers who have seen this movie brace your self, the best is yet to come."
799,isle-of-dogs-movie,RobCJameson,10,"If you've seen Fantastic Mr. Fox, you know Wes has a passion for animation. In this film, full of terrific voices, he improves beautifully and what you get is everything from a stop-motion clay animation that Aardman hasn't been able to give you."
800,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,Diggsee,10,"This was one of my favourite movies of all time. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega have such great chemistry it's a joy to watch, as is the chemistry with Harrison Ford and the new actors and Poe with Finn. That's why this movie is so great it feels like everyone is having a blast and the results are reflected on the screen. So much fun but also sad moments this movie has it all."
801,the-assassination-of-jesse-james-by-the-coward-robert-ford-movie,JacobP.,0," Half of this film are people sitting around a table or a campsite eating. Eating... and... talking. And then someone says something and everyone get really quiet until the ""tension"" which you never feel, is broken by a lame, thought-up-at-the-last-minute crude supposed cowboy joke. Huh huh huh. The film is all about taking forever to get to the point, if there is one. The actors look like they came out of the 20th Century. The accents are obviously not natural. The film is tedious, and insulting- in the first half an hour, I was glad I got to see it for free, but near the end, I just left. This is a horrible film made by a man who must've been getting paid by the minute or something."
802,the-pink-panther-movie,Hannes,1, It's not funny. Peter Sellers does it 100 times better than Steve Martin. The movie is a shame for the Pink Panther series.
803,avatar-movie,OneWhoKnows,0,"If I wanted to watch cartoons I most definitely would watch ROBOT CHICKEN. One or two of my in-laws INSISTED that the characters in this were REAL (not computer generated real but REAL!!!) That is the type of intellectual hooraying for this gigantic waste of my time that makes me squirm. OK the effects were decent. But I DO NOT watch movies for their effects. The story was adolescent and the ""camera work"" was marginal at best. Try watching cinema and not a 3d cartoon, you might find your artistic integrity improved."
804,inception-movie,JackS.,10," Wow. I have never had a moviegoing experience like this. all i can say is that i was amazing. revolutionary. I cant imagine why this is getting bad reviews! Maybe people are too lazy too follow, or just being contrarians. Put pay attention, and you will be rewarded immensely. A masterpiece. I would even say this is one of the best films of all time. I plan to see it many more times!"
805,fast-five-movie,wishmaster,0,"I only saw the first 15 minutes of the movie, and I do not really taste anything bad, I felt so uncomfortable to see Diesel is the worst actors I've seen, I lost myself in the scenes, went in one side and out of the other (literally). very disgusting"
806,there-will-be-blood-movie,GrantT,8," What surprised me above all else is that anyone likes this difficult cerebral film at all. The two lead characters are so bad, nay evil, and the critique of America (and thus western civilization) so vicious and unremitting that it is hard to find much to like. A cathartic confronting experience. Thank God Hollywood can still find a place for directors like Anderson."
807,stop-loss-movie,ChadS.,7," A man has the right to change his mind. He can flip-flop. But sometimes when you go too far, there is no point of return. Iraqi veteran Brandon King(Ryan Phillippe) tells his commanding officer, in so many words, that the president could go f himself, which should tell you something about whose side ""Stop-Loss"" is on. But: surprise, surprise. ""Stop-Loss"" is far from being ""In the Valley of Elah"". The president is disdainful towards people who flip-flop, but this filmmaker, to my surprise, flip-flops, from a liberal to a conservative agenda, ironically enough, and supports the war, in spite of a narrative that suggests otherwise. Like her previous film ""Boys Don't Cry"", this filmmaker captures the local culture of a community with objectivity. She doesn't leer. She's not judgemental about rural folks who ski-surf on dirt roads(from ""Boys Don't Cry""), or in this case, Texas denizens who get drunk and shoot their guns in the woods. And also like this director's previous film, ""Stop-Loss"" has a protagonist named Brandon. Coincidence? There's no such thing as coincidences. In ""Boys Don't Cry"", Brandon Teena was a girl who thought she was a boy. Brandon King is a soldier who thought he was a conscientious objector. ""Stop-Loss"" respects the men who serve our country. But does it respect our president, too? No upside-down flag in tatters, here."
808,district-9-movie,AmberD,3," I've seen more storyline, character development, action, and suspense with Transformers franchise and Starship Troopers trilogy than with this movie. District 9 combines those two movies in a slapped-together mishmash. After the evictions, it's practically a free'for'all. A lot of the gore was unnecessary, as it could have been implied, not an in-your-face, blood-spattered camera shots. I know it's just a movie, but some of the action, like blowing up a human, the pieces will be cooked, not bloody, scientifically/biologically speaking. The heat and force of the alien weapons would make it so. All in all, it was a slapped together, mishmash with obvious homage to Starship Troopers and very little or none at all morals or ethics which would have made the movie greater in character development. I watched it once, wanted to walk out halway through, but I watched it to the end. Won't do that again."
809,wonder-woman-movie,idontknowletstr,2,"I don't get it, people describe this film as ""incredible"" ""successful"" and ""impressing"". The film is boring, only special effects are decent, everything else is just pathetic. After 20 minutes you already know how it's going to end, full of cliché, some ""funny"" joke once in a while just to keep the spectator awake. Not even worth your time, so don't spend any cents to watch it"
810,beginners-movie,Halfwelshman,8,"Beginners is a film about life, and the hugely contrasting ways you can view it. Are you gay or straight? An optimist or a pessimist? A romantic or realist? These questions are discussed with great insight and wit by writer/director Mike Mills, whose life the main events of the film are based. The cast are extremely strong - Ewan McGregor giving an understated, but ever engaging performance as Oliver, a graphic designer who has recently lost his father and steadily spirals into depression. Melanie Laurent also impresses as Anna, a jobbing actress who is terrified of a committed relationship with Oliver and the impact it could have on her career. Most of all though, Christopher Plummer absolutely captivates you in every scene he's in. He plays Hal, Oliver's father, who decides to come out as gay aged 75 on the tragic death of his wife Georgia (the brilliantly kooky Mary Page Keller). Plummer plays against type, which is refreshing, but not the main reason to savour his performance. What really blew me away about his performance was how well-developed, relateable and instantly believable he made Hal as a character, which is thankful because he is the driving force behind most of the events of the film - if Hal didn't emotionally resonate with us, then neither would the film as a whole. Shortly after his coming out, Hal is diagnosed with cancer, and must find the balance between receiving treatment and enjoying the liberation of his new life with young partner Andy (Goran Visnjik), and all the while Oliver worries and contemplates his lifelong inability to communicate with his father. The story is told very creatively, frequently jumping backwards and forwards, with Oliver's retrospective, thoughtful voiceover giving some insight into how he felt at the particular moment we are watching. The film is deeply personal, emotionally compelling and often very funny. I personally don't see the point in subtitling the Hal's dog Arthur's thoughts - it's an interesting idea, but adds very little to the film, appearing to be just quirky for the sake of it. I also found the finale a little underwhelming, with the rest of the film feeling so narratively tight and full of ideas, the final moments appear a little unfocused and somewhat emotionally soppy. These minor points aside, Beginners is without doubt one of the best films of 2011, with an outstanding performance from Plummer, great writing, and through being an immensely rewarding viewing experience in general."
811,the-lone-ranger-movie,Kewldog1111,0,"This would have been the worst movie Ive seen in years. Depp, you should be ashamed of yourself. No continuity, no real story line, and I left before the movie was even 3/4 through.Not anything could have saved it."
812,the-dark-knight-movie,AngeloM,10, Epic. This spectacular performance can and will not be duplicated.
813,children-of-men-movie,Drew,9," Cassandra, sounds like your typical brain washed fox news fangirl (did I leave out brain washed christian too?). Why do people let their second-hand opinions about politics and religion, dictate their opinions that they actually have control over? This movie was much better than a 1. Good acting and great technical prowless 9 times out of 10 trumps anything that usually comes out of Hollywood."
814,untitled-rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-sequel-movie,AGarcia732,7,"Score: 7.5 ""There is no dawn without darkness."" Or was it, ""the night is always darkest before the dawn""? Oh well. My point is...what was my point again? Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a good movie. It has received ""Universal acclaim"" from Metacritic users. I don't like to be negative--especially with such a highly-praised movie--but I do have a few complaints. One, the humans. I think all the humans should've had a bit more development. One person I have specifically in mind when I say that is Dreyfus (played by Gary Oldman), leader of the remaining human survivors--who are somehow immune to the virus. (Exactly how are they immune?) Anyway, he had much less screen time than he deserved. The only real insight into his history is a picture on an iPad screen. The rest of the humans don't mention much about their history and past, except for snippets we learn in conversations. Two--the collapse of humanity is not really shown. I get that apocalypses and utopian/dystopian worlds have been done MANY times in all kinds of media--books, movies, TV, etc. But I would've liked to see more of what was left of the human world. On the plus side, a growing ape civilization IS shown. That's definitely unique and original. Three, we don't see much of what happens 10 or so years after the virus spreads. Well, we know--but we don't see much except for a quick montage. I would've liked to see more. The transition from the first film to this sequel is a bit too quick. And, four, I honestly would've liked to have seen some of the cast from the first film in the sequel (especially Dr. Will Rodman played by James Franco). All of these four suggestions could have easily been done through flashbacks throughout the film. But, I don't want anyone to mistake my suggestions for criticism. Because after many disappointments this year, I'd say this is definitely not one of them. The movie accomplishes what many films probably couldn't. Like making you be drawn to the apes, a species who are still developing and learning. (They're still getting the hang of talking. But when the apes do talk, it mesmerizes you.)  This film manages to make you pray that not one bullet is fired by the apes or humans. Because one bullet could set aflame the tension, animosity, and suspense between the two species and could lead to war. But it seems war is inevitable, and someone is bound to screw up and ruin the fragile peace between the apes and humans. The film has superb CGI, as pointed out by many. The film is good...but I feel ""Rise"" was better. I don't know why. Despite all that ""Dawn"" has going for it (those four small suggestions weren't really an issue), I didn't connect on a certain level with Dawn. I feel like Metacritic user ""jyeager11"". I quote his review, ""Could the addition of writer and Executive Producer Mark Bomback have negatively impacted the end product that much? I'm not sure. I wasn't there. And it's not like 'Dawn' is a bad movie. There's a lot about it I enjoyed (...) there's nothing technically wrong with this movie (... ) But there's nothing there that makes me likely to purchase a physical DVD copy anytime soon."" So, I liked Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. But I think certain things should've been expanded on a bit. Overall, it's a good film missing a FEW things IN MY OPINION. This sequel leaves me anxiously waiting for the next film in this series. (Maybe the apes are more evolved, talk fluently, and begin to emerge as Earth's dominant species?) If you liked this review, read my other ones on movies, TV shows, and videogames. I have reviewed the 2014 films Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, Blended, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, The Lego Movie, and more. I am actually still trying to find time for other film reviews, such as Robocop, Non-Stop, Divergent, Need for Speed, The Monuments Men, etc. I also review TV shows, such as Fox's ""Sleepy Hollow"", ABC's ""Marvel's Agents of SHIELD"", CW's ""The 100"", Fox's ""I Wanna Marry Harry"", NBC's ""Crisis"", Fox's ""Gang Related"" and more. Good bye! Sincerely, AG732."
815,the-revenant-2015-movie,Zonker68,1,"Wow. What movie have you all been watching??   Boring.  DiCaprio is dead, but no.  Surprise!  He lives!   And every time he is almost in over his head (!) he miraculously heals just that little bit more to keep going.   Oh-Oh - he is in a life-threatening situation!  How can he survive?  Being buried can't stop him.  Being beared can't stop him.  Being bared can't stop him.  Whatta guy!! Nine-tenths of the movie is a dead man walking in the snow.  Some plot, huh?  And can you contrive an ending?  Clearly, yes..... To compare this to Birdman is noxious.  Everyone talks about the great trials the entire crew endured to make this movie.  Well, news time.  Great trials, and being cold, and having to go through three hours of makeup before filming in no way make a great movie.  The Revenant is proof of that.  Unfortunately, it is also likely to be proof of the onanism of Hollywood. The only one who deserves any recognition at all for this tedious and repetitious movie is the bear.  At least he had the decency to die when he should have.  This movie, on the other hand, took 156 minutes to die, and that was 155 minutes too long."
816,world-war-z-movie,Spangle,7,"An action-packed thrill ride, World War Z does a great job blending those two genres with some elements of horror and really manages to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Brad Pitt is great in the lead role and entirely convincing as humanity's last hope. The film also does a great job eliciting emotion from the audience, as there are a few scenes that really keep you on the edge of your seat and that take you by surprise. This is in large part thanks to the some great direction from Marc Forster and some very good cinematography. The special effects with the zombies are also incredible, as is the makeup. The film definitely feels as though it is setting up for a sequel and I would definitely love to see one be made, especially considering how this one does not quite feel finished due to that. Overall, World War Z is an expertly made action-thriller that manages to entertain throughout."

818,untitled-3d-shark-thriller-movie,Myffubs,1,"It shouldn't come as much of a surprise that Shark Night 3D is awful. Its theatrical release is due entirely to the success of Piranha 3D, but it lacks Piranha's bite; sure, that movie was a nasty, semi-soft-core misogynist piece of trash, but at least it delivered on its promise of decidedly R-rated nudity and gore. Shark Night offers neither, instead throwing in an even more preposterous plot, even blander actors playing duller characters, and teases where Piranha came through. There's also overuse of MTV-style editing to let viewers know the characters are having fun, because anyone watching certainly won't be enjoying themselves. Put David R. Ellis at the helm and what you've got is a recipe for disaster. The ineptitude is clear from the opening sequence, which rips off of the opening sequence in Jaws. The attack is unclear and fairly unconvincing; where the effect of pulling someone through the water to simulate a shark attack was new in '75, here it feels obviously dated and, well, boring. The subsequent attacks are similarly handled, with characters simply being dragged underwater and no clear details, though some sequences feature horrible special effects and laughably unrealistic shark behavior. The plot comes second to the shark attacks, yet takes up most of the film's running time. College students venture to a lake house for Spring Break, only to find the waters fairly shark-infested. Might this have anything to do with the creepy, foreboding locals? Too much time is spent getting from one place to another, especially when a thinking audience can figure that most escape attempts won't play in favor of the college-aged shark bait. The 3D is hardly used, and when it is, the effect is hampered by the inability to properly frame the action. In the end, Shark Night 3D is a waste of your time and money. If you're really in the mood for a shark flick, you're much better off waiting for SyFy to have a Terror-in-the-Water weekend."
819,untitled-sam-raimi-horror-project-movie,calebowensmall,8,"Sam Rami, you are perfection. This was a great movie. It was scary and disturbing, and it's a really well acted film, especially from the little girl and father. The one is worth every penny to watch, and you should buy it on dvd, because your gonna want to watch it more than once!"
820,love-friendship-movie,NerdConsultant,2,"This is a film that was drastically oversold by the critics.  It’s a film where very little to nothing happens.  Kate Beckinsale tries her best with it but ultimately it’s a flawed film.  There is very little that happens in the film and when things do start getting going, the film ends!!!  Admittedly I am not the target audience for this film, I am not a fan of period dramas, especially the Jane Austen period dramas as I think they are often stuck in a formula that is tired and old and they don’t try to do anything contemporary with it, the trailer for this film alluded they were going to to that with this film, however, it doesn’t fully commit to that.  The film is not really funny, not very interesting, I would skip it."

822,wonder-woman-movie,EpicLadySponge,7,"I'm actually surprised to see a great DC film for once in so many years. Sure this isn't even near the gold Marvel is at right now, but Wonder Woman hides something that previous DC films have been missing out. Don't be expecting the same gold that Marvel films have right now to even appear in this movie because, again, this won't let us go anywhere from touching Marvel's gold."
823,deja-vu-movie,Tammmie,0, One of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. Everything was disjointed and the ending was awful. Much ado about nothing.
824,maggie-movie,babalonkie,9,"Ok let me start by saying, this is a drama, based in a Zombie epidemic. A inside view of farmers family dealing with a infected family member. There is no action and there is very little gore, its not a horror as such. Now my personal opinion. Lots of new going on in this film, i normally don't like Drama's but i am glad i gave this one a go. Acting is brilliant, the story is brilliant but slow, it's atmosphere paced and very touching. Very different take on a zombie apocalypse. Arnold's acting was brilliant and very surprising, Not massive dialogues, but enough, with the expressions and portrayal, Arnold did well. Everyone else in this movie also made it happen, nothing was flawed and it all came together well. Now it is slow and i was tempted to skip forward here and there but i stuck with it until the end and i am glad i did. It leaves a mark on you. Go into this movie expecting only a drama based in the zombie world and a whole new side to Arnold and you will appreciate it. Once again Drama's not my thing and Arnold's usual work is more to my taste, but i appreciated everything in this film, so on that perspective, il give it a 8.5/10. Its a shame people have not judged the film correctly. Nearly all Negative reviews say ""Bah where's the gore"", ""bah no action"" or ""Bah i hate Arnie"". If you see reviews involving anything similar to that... they have not watched it knowing what they were about to watch or are bigoted."
825,the-dark-knight-movie,JohnHendricks,10,"This movie is in a tie being the best film of the year(along with Slumdog Millionaire). This movie should have been nominated for best picture. The oscars are pathetic for nominating the Reader over The Dark Knight. This is a movie I could have seen over and over at the theaters and still not get tired with it. This was sad, but a great film. Great acting, musical score, special affects, synomatogrophy, and more. As much as I loved Batman Begins, this film trounces that in contrast. What a shame Heath Ledger died. He was such a splendid actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart were also flawless actors. The new Rachel had rather small shoes to fill from the first Rachel, but she was a good actress. See the Dark Knight! Also Slumdog Millionaire!"

While after hearing all the praise for this film I expected to love this movie more than I did, I still felt that this was a very strong film. While it may take a little time to get moving, the last third is a as entertaining as any movie I have seen this year. Very strong writing, visuals, and acting. This is one of the better movies of 2012."
828,avatar-movie,PeteN,0," This was just another political rant from the left. Corporations Bad, white people bad, white men destroying another planet. All you needed was Katie Curic and Susan Serandon to help explaine to those too stupid to recognize this for what it is. Indians good Cowboys bad."
829,enders-game-movie,CommanderDonut,2,"Let me preface this by saying that I am generally a fan of book to film conversions, especially when, as in this case, the author has had a hand in its production. I watched the Harry Potter films with a certain amount of glee knowing that its author had played a fairly integral part in bringing them to life, and it was with this in mind that I had been greatly anticipating seeing Ender brought to life on the big screen. I have read the entire Ender series dozens of times over the years, with each re-reading being as fulfilling as the first, so when I heard rumours that it was finally to be made in to a film I was overjoyed. Learning that Card himself was to play a part in its transformation was also pleasing news. Until that is I actually watched it. Let me be plain here. I do not expect any book, especially one of the same caliber as Enders Game, to translate perfectly on to the silver screen. Conversely I did not expect this a conversion to be such a gigantic insult to the source material. Literally everything in this movie is a watered down, imbecilic simplification of the book. Any and all feeling of  connection with Ender is stripped away in the first few minutes and it doesn't get any better from there on out. For the sake of not posting spoilers for anyone who may not have seen the film yet (and I advise that you do not) I won't go in to any detail, but suffice to say that whatever it was about Cards original novel that allowed the reader to connect to its characters has been as thoroughly vaporized as the enemies ships. From almost the moment the film begins you are rushed through at a light speed pace, never getting time to understand the characters or their motivations nor their connections to one another. Ender as he appears in the novel was someone that many thousands of people grew attached to, felt a kinship with and that is something that was a core requirement of making this in to a film. They failed. Miserably. I no more connected with this version of Ender than I could connect with a toilet roll. He and all the supporting cast were as devoid of meaning and feeling as it is possible for any living being to be and the entire film became an exercise in tediousness. I can think of no worse fate for Ender than to have been mutilated, chewed up and spat out in the manner that this film done, shame on Card for allowing this and shame on the cretin who made it."
830,moon-movie,BobN,8," Not much happens in this film. Most of it takes place in the station on the moon. Nonetheless, I liked it. It reminded me of Bradbury's short sci-fi stories, such as those in The Illustrated Man. To be honest, I cannot remember the last sci-fi film I enjoyed. This one is different. Is it great? No. Compared to the other crap sci-fi films of the past 20 years, it is fantastic. It was like reading a short story, and I loved it for that. The plot is not schocking, and one can tell where it heads. Yet, I still enjoyed it, simply for its purity, for its lack of ""here is the giant CGI shot"" type filmmaking. This is sci-fi done well."
831,across-the-universe-movie,Enrique,8," A strange experience. During the first 20 minutes (aproximately) I was hating this movie. When I was about to live, an extremely imaginatively and well choreographed scene made me stay. Very soon I fell in love with it and I stay during the whole show. I left the theatre with a pleasant feeling, in spite of a naive and almost silly ending. Visually stunning, excellent music background, and with the exception of Evan Rachel Wood, the cast is fine. Julie Taymor is a superficial director that obviously come from a Broadway background, but knows how to deliver her goods. With the exception of ""Titus,"" she has done nothing relevant."
832,elizabeth-the-golden-age-movie,TomasV.,2, Very repetitive storyline. Music soundtrack was remarkably bad. Acting was strong with major roles however smaller roles were remarkably weak Editing was acceptable Overall You would get far more from a history channel documentary then wasting 10 dollars for this.
833,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,DumBe,0,"Let down, to say the least. From the first scene to very last, The Last Jedi is utter garbage. The story, if there is one, makes no sense and the way it's delivered is boring and unimaginative. I found myself checking the watch every two minutes, hoping that the end would come and release me from the sheer pain this movie caused. Once the end is reached you are left feeling empty, used and betrayed. I felt no connection to any of the characters, and I could not care less, what happens to the ones that remain alive. Here's some of the highlights:""Yes, this is Hux"". I had to chek the ticket, that I was in the right hall and it was indeed a Star Wars movie, that was playing, after that classic Scary Movie quality scene.Luke milking the whatever it was, and winking at the camera.Leia's superman moment in the open space. Such magic.The whole subplot with Finn and Rose. Every second with vice admiral Holdo on the screen is painful. She is one of the worst(if not the worst) characters in the history of Star Wars. Laura Dern's performance seals the deal. Luke's pointless death.All in all the worst Star Wars movie, including the prequals."
834,a-christmas-carol-movie,Commander_Jim,9,"The thing that astounded me about this movie was how faithful it was to the original book. That was something I did not expect. But this is one of the most faithful adaptations yet made, it even keeps the Dickensian dialog intact instead of updating it for modern ears, which is something even highly regarded versions have done. In fact aside from a poorly conceived action sequence near the end of the film, it is almost a word for word recreation of the book. Visually the movie is stunning, Dicken's London has been brought to life in a way never before seen. It is dark, atmospheric and captivating. The characters themselves are works of art, all beautifully brought to life by some brilliant motion capture and voice acting.This is one of my very favorite versions of the story, a beautifully crafted and faithful movie. But parents be warned, Dickens' story was a ghost story, it was intended to scare. This is no Muppets Christmas Carol. It has some surprisingly dark and scary moments. Not a movie for the little ones."
835,the-warren-files-movie,Glitter,2,"Combining every memorable element of Horror from a previous film before it, The Conjuring masters at scaring by not allowing you to realize you've been conned into 100 minutes of cheap tricks and bumps in the night. Forcing the religious angle for relative ease in accepting that possession exists, and then use the ""Salem witch"" as a scapegoat of Baphomet to ride through the black hole plot. Perhaps they should sacrifice this witch to let the film end?

842,the-wolf-of-wall-street-movie,Danielleleigh,10,"Absolutley loved this film, amazing acting done by the whole cast! Kept me laughing the whole way through, I'd recommend this film as a must see! I saw it on its release date on friday, and will be going to see it again on wednesday :) xo"
843,harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-movie,elij,0, I'm not going to lie to myself on this one...i really hated this movie a lot. It really seemed like 95 percent of the movie was the magic(pun intended)of teen romance in a time of complete and utter chaos.
844,transformers-age-of-extinction-movie,Thegodfatherson,0,"Micheal Bay, you have done it again. Transformers Age Of Extinction is another 2hr Micheal Bay dream. And if you really want to watch a movie with explosions and robots- Real Steel or Pacific Rim are good choices. Mark Walhberg plays a mechanic who finds a transformer and then all hell breaks loose. You know, I was kinda hyped for this movie. I was hoping for a good action movie, but no it was like Revenge Of The Fallen got a remake with Mark Walhberg. Story is poor, nothing is sad and the characters are bad too, you don't care about any of them. The visual effects gave me a seizure. The acting was damn bad. Micheal Bay, is  Pain. And Gain the only good movie that you have made? Ignore this at all costs"
845,argo-movie,Leatherwood,3,"The only thing good about Argo is the fact that its based on a true story, but it obviously does not stop the fact that Ben Affleck is a bad actor and that Arabians speaking frantically is extremely annoying. This movie is great if you can get past Ben Afflecks acting and annoying Arabians acting like imbeciles. To keep it short and sweet like everyone should on this site, if you don't care for the true story don't watch it. If you do watch it, watch it. Then stop watching it and turn on something worth watching."
846,midnight-in-paris-movie,PhoenixBird,1,"A big disapppointment. Very poor acting. The film meanders without any true thought and suffers by a pointless resolution--the protagonist is trapped in his own fantasy--but so what? A bad imitation of the famous characters the film seeks to illuminate, and a hasty Americanised view of Paris."
847,the-company-men-movie,JamesL,8,This was a good film that captured the reality of America today. Strong performances all around drive this film. I wish there had been more about the affair but again it was a great start to 2011.
848,the-tree-of-life-movie,caviiblanc,10,"The photography of this movie is beautiful, the plot too. Terrence Malick did a wonderful job, and the acting was amazing. What I like about this movie is that it isn't obvious, it makes you wonder, it's definitely not made for the common viewer. Like I said, beautiful movie."
849,the-last-airbender-movie,guitarguy001,0,"Oh my god this is terrible. Easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen and probably ever made. The movie is paced like crap, the visual effects are very mediocre and the green screen is horrendously noticeable. The story is also very bad and has a lot of things that don't make sense (Earthbending prison being pretty much a camp and they could bend and escape at any moment but they don't for some reason) And the characters......my god what have they done to you guys. All the characters are extremely lifeless (except for two, somewhat) and are absolutely boring and unfunny. They have none of the charisma, humor or development that they had in the show and you could give two craps less about them. Oh yeah and the mispronunciations are terrible too and it's also wrong when it comes too the cultural aspect (if you watch the show, you know what i'm talking about) The ONLY positives of this movie are Iroh and Zuko. Those two are the only characters in the entire movie to ACTUALLY have some kind of emotional background (Zuko) or at the very least give a crap about someone (Iroh). Zuko also has the best acting and the best action scenes as The Blue Spirit because it looks practical and actually looks like fighting instead of dancing. This movie is just horrible. Save yourself the time and save yourself the heartbreak if you're a fan of the show, and avoid this movie at all costs. It's one of the worst movies ever."
850,pacific-rim-movie,SJ-ULTI-Reiews,7,"Pacific Rim is a really interesting and unique movie. The battles between the robots and the monsters are freakin amazing. This is an amazing movie to watch in 3D. The story is pretty predictable, but their are some funny moments. Overall Score=75/100"
851,book-club-movie,duanewilliams,8,I watched this film in an audience of mostly women and there were very few minutes during the film when someone wasn’t laughing.  I thought it was very entertaining and so did everyone else who saw it with me.
852,kiss-of-the-damned-movie,A_So_Horror_Fan,8,"“Kiss Of The Damned” carries us back to the golden age of vampire tales when we held a romantic and dark desire for the creature of the night. This film is what I would imagine reading one of those supernatural themed Harlequin-eque romance novels would be like. The director explored the more passionate side of daily life and love affair between a vulnerable but strong woman and a man desperate to love her in every way. It was down right gothic and sweet. The film didn’t bother getting too graphic or soft-core with the heightened sexuality of the relationships depicted in the movie but it was adult enough to be sheer supernatural eye candy. This movie is a great date movie for that vampire loving partner or person you want to kick it with. The story was compelling in true dramatic style that expresses the lives we expect vampires to enjoy. Just note that this is not a “horror” movie nor do I believe the director ever intended it to be one. “Kiss Of The Vampire” is a film that flows more as an emotional heart-song with moments that rise to melodrama before sliding darkly down into melancholy. There is plenty of blood soaked sequences that express the true nature and conflict that lives within the vampire but it does not push the themes to the level of grindhouse or exploitation. The movie will not be for everyone and if you enter the tale looking for high octane exuberance, of ravenous creatures as monsters, with bodies writhing in guts and gore- then you will not be satisfied. However if you remember the classic view of the more romantic creature of more gothic tales of the vampire then this movie gives you the heat, passion and- yes -the bloodstains as well."

854,repo!-the-genetic-opera-movie,jayman69,1,"This was as close to garbage as far as garbage goes. One or two 'interesting' scenes does not make a mediocre movie into a cult movie. The general premise of an idea is there, ruined by some poorly chosen actors singing some poorly chosen songs."
855,safe-house-movie,nameless,2,I wanted this film to be good but it was just exhausting. Denzel's scenes were left on the cutting room floor because they set him up as the master manipulator and then no manipulation. For some reason it turned into a Ryan Reynolds movie running around reacting. This isn't a Denzel film it is a Green Lantern without the costume set on earth without the aliens.

857,the-last-airbender-movie,BruceK,0," Waste of money, in my thoughts. It was so random it seemed like the people who planned the movie never even saw the cartoon. The mispronunciations and wrong depictions from the cartoon, this movie was an Epic Fail. They should just re-do the whole movie."
858,green-lantern-movie,Pahn,0,"Ryan Reynolds has officially ruined his career with this movie.  Until this point, he'd been a great comedy actor with some crossovers into drama &amp; action.  The only movies of the comic-book inspired superhero genre worth seeing, in my opinion, are the revived Batman series of movies.  Even those are getting a bit campy with Bale's overly-dramatic angry whisper-delivered dialogue.  Hollywood needs new creative minds badly."
859,borat-cultural-learnings-of-america-for-make-benefit-glorious-nation-of-kazakhstan-movie,JF,0," Terrible. I'm generally a huge fan of these types of movies, you know, the kind that you don't have to know anything about anything to think its funny? But... this was a disaster. The plot was a mess, every scene was uncomfortable, and personally, I just think that every single joke bombed. I expected a lot out of this movie, and it did nothing but disappoint. I wish I could get my money back."
860,the-gunman-movie,metaguest,2,"Awful movie.  Sean Penn as love interest to a lovely young lady made me cringe.  He looked like an old fart on steroids, lots of them.  I had to fast forward through love scenes, couldn't stomach them. Story was so ridiculous when he got spells from illness yet took out bad guys like there's no tomorrow.  Snooze between dumpsters and good to go.  Would have played slightly, and I emphasize slightly, more believable if they hadn't thrown in the brain damage.  Ray Winstone and Idris Elba were good;  both should have had a lot more screen time.  Javier Bardem overacted when he was ""drunk and was otherwise still quite bland.   Story very predictable in a lot of parts, clues as to what was coming were really in your face.  Yeesh, what an absolute waste of time."
861,jobs-movie,Dude45,1,"Just another piece of Apple advertising, it was so biased toward Jobs and his life that it was completely cringe worthy to say the least, it give no depth, is often too over-the-top, and at times just downright inaccurate, the movie feels like it's juggling reality and Hollywood, also, Bill Gates never existed according to the writers."
862,transformers-movie,MorganF,8," Full of semi-confusing action sequences, a down-to-earth lead, and surprisingly funny. Transformers is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while."
863,lucy-movie,ilter,3,"Despite knowing the premise of the movie was and is completely based on pseudoscience instead of any scientific facts, I went to see it in a theatre just because I just wanted to have fun and feel entertained by the action. It was a waste of money. The action is very poor by 2014 standards. There are some weird, National Geographic or Animal Planet films/cuts placed into the movie, which probably meant something for the mind of the director. Okay, I get it, an approaching wild cat to its prey... but come on, what have you had to be that high, dude? It doesn't even look funny. Save your money if you haven't seen it in a cinema - it's only good for renting when you are hopeless and alone at home."

868,dan-in-real-life-movie,VauhgnL.,2," Quite possibly the most boring movie I've ever seen. The characters are boring, the story is boring and the comedy falls flat."
869,man-of-steel-movie,Andys_Reviews,8,"The opening sequence on Krypton is quite spectacular with some truly stunning CGI and some great dialogue. It sets the scene for the entire story and I think it was just about as perfect a beginning we could possibly have had. We then come down to earth (literally) where we find Clark Kent discovering who he is and coming to terms with his powers and what a responsibility that places on his shoulders. Much of this is told in flashback with some great fatherly advice from Kevin Costner. It’s a section of the film that may have lost some (probably due to the lack of explosions) but I really enjoyed it as it gives us a chance to get to know what motivates Clark/Superman, and just what makes him a superhero. The third act, however, is where I had the most trouble. The plot wasn’t hard to follow and the acting was great, particularly Michael Shannon, no, all that was great. The problem was with the fight scenes; why is it necessary to topple skyscrapers and destroy entire city blocks. It put me in mind of climactic battle in ‘The Avengers’ movie; I had the distinct impression I had seen it all before. Yes, it was quite a spectacle but I would have liked something a little more original. But don’t let that distract from the fact it is still a very good film and one I would happily watch again. Top performances, well everybody really but Michael Shannon really does stand out; definitely worth a look. SteelMonster’s verdict: RECOMMENDED My score: 8.3/10"

Here the mistakes. You turned this Superhero movie into a more of a drama. Plus the action scenes wasn't that great eiter. Kid might like those. But for older people it is boring.Way Way Way too much talking man. you don't know any action that well and so does you partner name James sclamcus. do you know any actions that well? Guess not! You should study more action appealing to American Audiences. OR even better, they should hired John woo, another Chinese Director who know more action better. He directed Face off. the story and the action in Faceoff is beautifully crafted."
872,upintheair-movie,alxm,2, I wanted to watch this movie after the Academy nominations. I kept waiting for it to improve but then it ended and left me feeling like I had just wasted 2 hrs. I am a big fan of G-Clooney but this is one was poor.
873,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,rochmik81,1,"Rian Johnson and the producers are deluding themselves about the reaction to this film.

Your fans don't like it. Lying to yourselves about that reality is just sad.

874,gravity-movie,abramedi,10,"I would never waste the time to do this ever in my life, but for the first time, I had to register on this website just to give a review of this movie, first of all, If you're not affected by it, 3d should be your first and only option to see this movie. This is one movie that I followed on imdb as it climbed up from 8.4 to 8.8 now on its ratings. I have never been so stunned. This movie is breathtaking, there's no way to describe this movie to convince you to go watch it. This movie is one of the very first of its kind and makes you think when watching rather than making it too obvious like other movies nowadays. This movie got me on the edge of my seat, I was just mesmerized at how a movie could be so good. WOOOOW!!!, special effects, acting, breathtaking visuals, fiction at its best and good idea. This is one of the very first movie that made me want to pay again in the same theater and wait to watch the next time it was showing the same day. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIEEEEEEEE!!!!!, IT'S NOT JUST WHAT PEOPLE SAY. It's interesting, brilliant and drags you into it's world more and more, devouring you and feeding you pleasure. Movie recommended without thinking twice or hesitating, definitely watching again-3D, with another set of friends."

877,untitled-star-trek-sequel-movie,reddave2,8,"Star Trek films are a mixed bag for me, mostly not living up to the quality of the tv shows (well, not counting Voyager) JJ Abrams first movie was a solid, if slightly flat at times movie. Here, it feels he has nailed most things. Indeed, apart from some silly plotting I would have marked this higher. The cast from the first movie return and I have to say, I really like them as a group. A third film (or even a fourth) wouldnt be a bad idea. In addition they get the addition of Benedict Cumberbatch as one of the main antagonists. He's great in his role but the twist in his character falls flat  granted, I know the back story but if you havent watched previous trek (and I dont mean the last film) the revelation isnt really explained. Its not the only time the writing works against the film. Certain moments don't add up, and there's always a slight feeling that things are happening to create a set-piece. No real harm in that for a summer blockbuster but here its feel more artificial than most. Thankfully, the set pieces are mostly very entertaining and while even if things dont link up as well as they should, you wont be bored. I'm giving this an 8 as a closet Trek fan. Take that done by 1 if you arent familiar with previous versions of Star Trek."
878,black-swan-movie,AVCITY,9,"A great theatrical experience. From the very first frame I was submerged in this world and more importantly, inside Natalie Portman's performance which is what really tells the story. She is more telling of her character when she is not talking, I believed her every second she was on screen. I sympathized with her and went through all the dark emotions played out with her. She shouldn't get all the credit though. Darron Aronofsky does a tremendous job with the camera and the visuals, all subtle and eerie. He has created a great dark fantasy."
879,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,PedroFez,2,"Great CGI and FX , great acting, solid soundtrack, Worst Star Wars Movie made , empty , non-meaningful character plots and wasted potential in the script writing.

It had it's share of suspenseful moments and it's touching moments and that's hard to do that as well as this movie does it. I loved the movie and I believe that it should have gotten the ratings it deserved. And no, I'm not going to say I would recommend it to everyone, because it's not for everyone, my mother refuses to watch it due to its premise of a innocent teen being brutally murdered. It does seem quite upsetting at points and if young kids would watch it, it may cause them nightmares. But it's a good movie"

884,300-rise-of-an-empire-movie,LXQUICKJUSTICE,0,"This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.  You know that movie you like? And then that sequel that comes out and ruins it? Well, this is that movie! I never loved 300, but it's super macho killing was moderately interesting when watched either drunk or stoned, but rise of an empire basically comes along and takes a huge dump on it. Spoilers ahead  Okay... Get this... According to this movie, you know that Xerxes god character? Well he has this sister right... And she's totally the brains of the operation and 100% manipulated everything that happened in movie 1 because... She's... Ugh... Female I guess... And it's only %10,000 unrealistic for a bunch of arab men to follow a woman into battle in ancient times, but WHATEVER, it's a movie... But... This whole flick is about her failed attempts to look arousing while smirking from ear to ear and it culminates in her telling off Xerxes really big to ""Go sit on your golden throne and enjoy the safety my army provides you."" If the makers of this film had any sort of respect for the 1st movie, they wouldn't reduce Xerxes to such a pathetic character, I mean, he already basically lost in movie 1, and now we're supposed to believe he can't even run his own army? What's left? Will the 3rd 300 movie feature a distant cousin who totally manipulated Xerxes, his sister and all of humanity into a war while leisurely eating grapes in a distant land? Makes about as much sense as this crap. I enjoyed the movie for a while but little sis running the show and her 13 foot brother being a weakling got old really fast. After she told him off, I didn't even bother watching the final battle. What for? I did jump ahead a little and saw Leonidas' queen charging the enemy, and instantly felt good about my decision to skip the last 25 minutes... It was bad."
885,inception-movie,ElliottF,10,"Not too bad ladies and gentlemen, not bad at all. It starts with a bang and never stops. From the intense fight scenes to the emotional love scenes, the movie never slows down. During the movie, let's admit it, we were all a bit confused at some point, but never make the mistake of thinking too hard about during the film or asking the guy next to you, because you'll end up missing the explanation. If you go into this movie fully prepared to think, there will be no problem."
886,interstellar-movie,RlCHARD,2,"I was extremely disappointed by this movie.  I felt it was pretentious, imitative, overlong, and predicated on meaningless pseudoscientific gibberish.  Matthew McConaughey delivers most of his lines in an almost inaudible near-whisper for no apparent reason. Some movies pay respectful homage to their predecessors, but this movie seems to have consciously set as its goal to out-2001 ""2001, A Space Odyssey"", as well as several other sci-fi goodies. Unfortunately, 2001 was based on a loftier artistic concept than merely trying to outdo a predecessor and so has a huge advantage out of the starting gate. The soundtrack I found especially annoying due to extreme overuse of the ""hey folks, this is the awesome moment of grandeur you've been waiting for"" emotion which it attempted to invoke about every three minutes and as a result made it impossible to detect when, if ever, a moment of true grandeur and awe might actually have occurred.   Numerous moments in the movie were clearly designed to extract that emotion from gullible moviegoers but for me they were unconvincing. Special effects are for the most part very good and there were some enjoyable and exciting moments when I wasn't thinking about the silly context they took place in.  Certainly not worth the three hour time and money investment."
887,anastasia-movie,ThomasD.,8, It's scarry for kids. The bad guy head comes off. He falls a part. What's that all abot?
888,transformers-the-last-knight-movie,Astor_,2,"It's clear (about half an hour into the film) they are putting some effort in putting some new stuffs into this franchise, like the King Arthur-Knight-Merlin stuffs. CGI is good. The plots are alright but lacking depth, and illogical in some area. The worst parts about the movie are the cheesy 'bad' jokes ridden throughout the movie, to the point it severely bring down the movie to mediocrity. Because of the terrible 'bad jokes', I felt compelled to give this a rating of '2', otherwise I would give the film a rating of '4'. This film is watchable if you keep your expectation low."
889,carrie-movie,Thegodfatherson,7,"Filmgoers who are not interested in seeing a modern remake of Carrie are equally unlikely to be won-over by Peirce’s effort  since it tells (mostly) the same story without dramatically improving anything but the onscreen visuals. Nevertheless, for viewers who are open to the remake, the assembled cast and crew manage to accomplish their goal of updating the still timely Carrie storyline with a more intense (and gory) retelling of events for the contemporary movie market. While it might not have been necessary, the Carrie remake is still an adept, entertaining, and at times downright haunting, piece of filmmaking."
890,deja-vu-movie,MikeC.,9, Fabulous movie. Bring your imagination - but it's not as preposterous as some might think. (Who knows what the possibilities are over the next 10 years?) Well-acted. Caviezel makes a great evil adversary. Enjoyed every minute.
891,on-the-road-movie,Benarden,3,"Some of the cinematography is worthwhile, bits of acting are noteworthy but, in the end, it's a book you can't really make into a film.What would be shocking and extraordinary in the late 50's now looks fairly tame and often sad. there is a lack of rhythm to the editing, too many  unconnected ideas,  big, sprawling and dull.If they had tried for something smaller, maybe it might have worked."
892,the-book-of-life-movie,michael1208,8,"The film combines life and death with heavy Halloween theme, Mexican culture and folklore might look a bit weird but overall a successful animation to draw the attention of family audiences. Its complexity offers a fresh potential to be creative, but there is slight imbalance on the story development between the unnecessary slow-pace first half and the too-fast progression towards the end. Unexpectedly, the surprising good choice and entertaining musics, colorful visual stunning feast and delightful romance are more than sufficient to make the film to be beautiful and refreshing. This joyful and crowding story about love, family, honor and friendship delivers a strong message that learning to forgive and to be yourself, love will truly live."
893,guess-who-movie,MrMovieBuff,2,"'Guess Who' is a dry comedy, a remake of the classic 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' (1967), only this time, it has a race role reversal, where the original film was about a white family meeting a black man, this film centers around a black family meeting a white man. This new concept had the potential to be very funny and ironic, but instead, is just pondering and badly timed. The movie stars Ashton Kutcher as Simon Green, who is the boyfriend of Theresa Jones (Zoe Saldana), and she wants him to meet her family. She brings him to dinner and it seems that Simon is having trouble getting on with her father, Percy (Bernie Mac). The movie focuses heavily on the working relationship between these two opposite characters. It also seems that the relationship between Simon and Theresa is put further to the test since it seems that Simon may have lied about what he does. Theresa sees that there could be no way to fix this relationship if they can't trust each other enough. Percy seems to enjoy seeing Simon suffer for a while when his relationship with Theresa doesn't seem to be working out. But, sooner or later, Simon and Percy settle their differences to make things right. The film is incredibly unfunny, and some of the best and capable actors don't do much with the material they are given. It is a wasted potential as the reverse premise could have been something more, but instead is just used as a modern gimmick. Ashton Kutcher isn't funny enough, to me, to be the main subject in this film. I never personally thought he is capable enough to carry a movie. There is little care for any of these characters in this movie, they all fall under the usual cliche tropes in any romantic comedies. All of these characters are nothing more than bland, walking, talking stereotypes. A romantic comedy with little purpose."
894,godzilla-2014-movie,emirbud,0,"Why do I keep doing this to myself? This movie is awful on all fronts. Every single aspect of this movie is terrible and stupid - the plot, the subplot, the superplot, the dialogue, acting. Even the special effects are lame. I hope they paid Cranston piles and piles of $ to compromise his acting career in this fashion. He was trying to act like crazy in a wholesomely futile and purposeless effort, and all he succeeded to do is to look ridiculous. At least they put him out of his misery quickly. Don't even get me started on Juliette Binoche. What the hell is she doing in this fiasco. She dies quicker than Cranston so maybe she hopes no one really noticed her. I marked this review to contain spoilers, but there's no spoiling this movie. It is spoiled beyond anything I can reveal here, and revealing how terrible this movie is can only help people's lives and I feel that it is my citizen's duty to do so. Here goes: the movie ends with Godzilla being cheered by masses because he had just killed the other two monsters (hybrids between a bat, the alien, praying mantis, and early days of robotics) with his dragon breath. His motive was to restore balance?!?! Humans are quite inconsequential, and they all act like bunch of people who just don't care and are fully aware that all of it is just make believe. Anyhow, give it a wide berth."

896,toy-story-3-movie,Sueyzid,8,"It is a very good movie and most of the critics are right. BUT there was one thing that really stuck out to me. I cant believe i am the only one who noticed that. Spoiler NowSo as it turns out the Teddy Bear is the bad guy. No Problem so far, but in the end when they're all about to burn and die, they (=all the goood guys) can save themselves expect the teddy Bear who is still in danger. He apologizes and panics so they decide to save him too. RIght after he betrays them and its shown that saving him was a mistake... Am i the only one that thinks this is sending a bad message to children? i mean dont get me wrong, i really dont care if movies have a moral or anything. But a movie with the name ""Toy Story 3"" is clearly made for a younger audience and this is teaching them that bad people shouldnt be forgiven because they will never change. I think we should teach children to forgive others and that nobody is ""bad"", just misguided and confused. THey should learn to help poeple like that and not give up on them and ""throw them in the flames"" like in the movie... Well all in all its still a great movie. A lot of fun. I just wouldnt show it to kids... (which is ironic,..)"
897,deadpool-2-movie,jamessprague,8,"Deadpool 2 is a movie for Deadpool fans, a lot of the hand-holding in the first movie is is not here. Many of the references in the film are from the Deadpool universe so much so that they will go over most people's head.  the action is there the jokes are there the entertainment is there. Deadpool 2 builds up on the first movie in the lot of good ways and then not some good ways. if you are a fan of the Deadpool character you owe it to yourself to see this movie if you are only a fan of the first Deadpool movie you may not like the left turns taken in this movie"
898,star-trek-beyond-movie,hadjr,0,"My wife and I both agreed that if we hadn't had one of our kids with us, we would have walked out. Considering we have been together for almost 30 years, seen hundreds of movies together (our first date was Rainman), and have NEVER walked out on a movie, that's saying something!We grew up watching the orginal ST on a black and white TV. What made it special was the interaction of the crew members not the cheesy FX. Somewhere in all the remakes , that has gotten lost...The premise of this film was flimsy from the outset. The filmakers just couldn't wait to get to the far end of the universe. Another cheap piece of plastic holds the key to a doomsday machine (G of the G anyone?). Wooden dialog, no subtext or subplots, no real winks or humor. Just lazy, color by numbers, industrial moviemaking likely to gross a billion dollars. Oh, and we paid a vig for 3D which was nonexistant. One word for that... Chutzpah!"
899,tomb-raider-movie,Bertronomous,10,"I was surprised! Very good film, kept me interested throughout. Unsure as to why the reviews are that bad yet for Black Panter (a mediocre at best film) is raved about. This is the first GOOD video game film I've ever seen! Well done!"
900,rachel-getting-married-movie,aideenM,10," Excellent acting. Anne Hathaway is memorable in a difficult role. Her experiences with a dysfunctional family, during her sister's wedding weekend, are heartbreaking."
901,dunkirk-movie,Domgwy,8,"Christopher Nolan has developed a reputation as a continually ambitious and clever film-maker. His back-catalogue has played with the conventions of narrative (Memento), deconstructed film itself (The Prestige) and tackled challenging cinematic subjects such as the nature of reality (Inception) and the time-space continuum (Interstellar) with mixed results.With Dunkirk, Nolan brings his unique sensibility to a true story of war and survival, and the results are equally stunning and ambitious.Beyond the incredible cinematography and film-making craft on display the most striking thing about Dunkirk is its unique structure. Rather than following a linear narrative, the film cuts between three perspectives; land, sea and air. While the action cuts between these viewpoints the timelines can at times get a little confused, (an evacuation taking place at night cuts back to a dogfight in broad daylight for instance) which can distract from the film itself, at least on first viewing. As with most of Nolan’s films, Dunkirk demands repeat viewing and I’m sure on further thought these stylistic choices will become more clear.Individually however each element of the story is played out perfectly. While a group of young soldiers battle to get home, a squad of Spitfire pilots desperately provide air-deference and a civilian father and son sail their small yacht across the channel to help in anyway they can.Each thread is played with subtlety and pathos by the ensemble cast. There are no showy, oscar-bait performances in Dunkirk. Instead the cast deliver understated and powerful depictions of real men in real situations. For almost all his screen time, Tom Hardy (easily the biggest star in the film) is hidden behind a flight mask. It is a testament to his skill that with only his eyes he is able to communicate the indecision and internal conflict within his character.Likewise, veteran actors Mark Rylance and Kenneth Branagh exude British fortitude with their stiff-upper lip attitude tinged with underlying emotion and empathy for the young men in harms way.To say Dunkirk is light on action is a disservice, however in terms of battles this is no Saving Private Ryan. Instead Nolan depicts the constant threat to the British forces as an existential horror. The German forces are almost an element to be overcome like fire or the sea rather than an enemy with a set of goals and motivations. This approach is incredibly effective and certainly succeeds in putting the audience in the position of the soldiers as the terrifying sound of the Luftwaffe dive bombers rises to meet the defenseless British ground forces.On first viewing the sense of desperation and dread is only undermined by the films structure. As a tense scene on the beach inter-cuts with a claustrophobic standoff on the sea, you find yourself wondering, ‘hang on, was this the day before? or is this all happening at the same time?’. Ideally you should be so engrossed in the drama of the situations that questions like this shouldn’t matter too much. By cutting in-between though, Nolan sometimes denies scenes the opportunity to play out.Towards the films climax however, the three threads are brought together in a breathtaking crescendo which makes all the narrative trickery worthwhile.As with his previous film (Interstellar), the director has shown that his own ambition can sometimes be a hindrance. However each element of Dunkirk does a stunning job of recreating an amazing true story and the experiences of those involved. No doubt it will be a film that will be discussed and re-watched just as much as Nolan’s fictional works. If that demand for repeat viewings is his greatest trick, then the film maker has succeeded in bringing a little known military miracle to the public consciousness, not just for a few weeks during the summer blockbuster season, but for years to come.While showing the Germans as these faceless machines of war is effective, it does fall into the age old trap that war movies struggle to escape — demonizing the enemy. In all likelihood the soldiers on the other side of the conflict were also young men called up to serve their country and give their lives for someone else’s political beliefs. This isn’t a problem with Dunkirk specifically but more of a wider societal issue where cinema continues to reflect the old saying that ‘history is written by the victors’. While films such as Dunkirk and last years’ Hacksaw Ridge tell true stories of extraordinary heroism from the British and American sides of the war, any similar stories from the opposite side of the conflict seem to have been lost to history."
902,king-kong-movie,JayH.,8," I lives up to all the hype. This is one hugely entertaining film. Naomi Watts is great and the rest of the cast is fine as well. The special effects are some of the best I have ever seen. It hardly seemed three hours plus because the film was immensely engrossing. Peter Jackson did a great job. The sets, sound and editing are all first rate. The period detail of 1933 is fantastic. This is brilliant film making and has everything a great movie should have."
903,blue-jasmine-movie,Redfox475,8,"Great movie - funny, dramatic, and consistently entertaining.  Cate Blanchett is a true artist.  Woody Allen killed it with this one.  Alexander Skaarsgard (sp?) was my least favorite part.  He just seemed out of place amongst such connected actors."
904,child-44-movie,drambuie_,7,"It sure was a long movie but i wasn't bored at all cause i think there was just enough time for the characters to develop , so i felt really close to them and i shared their feelings, especially tom hardys.He gave an exceptional performance . Even if i liked it overall, in the end something was  missing about the plot and left me with unanswered questions. Maybe it is not a very well adapted book into the big screen."
905,dracula-untold-movie,FranMan,8,"In conclusion I will say that ""Dracula Untold"" I found it very good: the main actor is excellent, the visuals and action scenes equally. The leadership is acceptable, but more needs to be loosened, missing some tables in this. Already sung there will be second part, with the final step opens the second, and I hope it happens. I recommend the film is entertaining, and if you wanted to watch a good movie Dracula, I recommend this, it is best that they have given us since Bram Stoker's Dracula. This film is a pleasure to see comparing Twilight "
906,tsotsi-movie,MarcK.,7," I'd have to say my feelings are similar to what was said by the ReelViews critic...and I would also make this a 7.5 rating if I were allowed to do that here. It's still early, but this has a great chance to be in my best 10 film list (US Releases) for 2006. Definitely deserves it's Oscar nomination, and definitely deserves a look-see."
907,good-luck-chuck-movie,J-Shap,0,"In DC comics lore, there exists an Anti-Life Equation, which serves as proof of mathematical certainty that life, hope, and freedom, are all pointless. Good Luck Chuck is the Anti-Funny Movie; it proves that even in a modern world where we get to see films like Superbad and Knocked Up, the idea of laughing is not worth it."
908,the-croods-movie,raleigh142,10,"Extremely funny, unique characters and animation. Best Animated Movie ever made. I am hoping for a sequel soon. I soooo love all the characters especially Grandma, so funny!"
909,boyhood-movie,virginiaproud,3,"I am convinced that all the critics are giving this bouquets because they are scared not to. I mean, it's Linklater and it's a 12 year project and it's so frightfully ""well observed"". But did we observe anything interesting, or insightful...really? Come on, really? The early promise that we'd see the boy grow through the emotional impact of divorce and domestic violence and being slightly unconventional, but it never eventuates and ultimately it all just leads to your common or garden teen's self indulgent prattling. There were some terribly clever things going on, especially the editing of the time jumps, and I was always curious to see how the actors had aged, including the next hairstyle choice.On the positive Linklater didn't take us down conventional routes, there was no 'coming of age sex scene"" for example, or any 'teen makes bad judgement call and gets into trouble' scene. But neither has he built any significant conflict. I wouldn't call this film an utter waste of my time, but I've no idea what people are raving about."
910,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,Truethis,0,"Terrible movie.  The first 30 minutes or so aren't that bad, but eventually, something stupid starts happening every 5 minutes!

915,nowhere-boy-movie,googolendtimes,8,"""Nowhere Boy"" is an enjoyable, interesting, and quite moving glance at John Lennon's formative years, and a showcase for a great performance by Aaron Johnson, who perfectly captures Lennon's vulnerability and burgeoning rebellious spirit. Similarly, Anne-Marie Duff and Kristin Scott Thomas are fantastic in their respective roles as John's estranged mother and his aunt/guardian. Perhaps most importantly of all, this is accessible for the most casual fan of John Lennon and the Beatles - though some fans may be a little frustrated at the lack of insight into Lennon's music."
916,the-grudge-movie,SarahMichelle,7,Sarah Michelle Gellar Gives a powerful performance while the rest of the cast is so so. Starts out great with creepy story telling and very good scares. Similar to the ring. At times it may feel confusing. The ending was too long it Just really Needed to end by that point. Otherwise a great movie for tweens. (7/10).
917,the-wolverine-movie,StepOverSteve,7,"Here is my video review for the filmhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYo06t5al84 Short Conclusion:Those who are not easily satisfied may not enjoy this film. But I think those looking for a good time, a few laughs and some great action scenes will enjoy it. The Wolverine has been universally acknowledged as an improvement on X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Rotten Tomatoes gave it 68% and IGN gave it 8.5 but I’m going to side with seasoned film critics here and give it a 7/10."
918,amelie-movie,Brian_McInnis,0,"Thirty-five. That is the approximate number of times I bellowed theusual two-word, seven- letter refrain at the screen while watching thisabomination of cinema. That would bring the total number of instancesI've bellowed this phrase at a movie to perhaps forty. Every other movie I've ever seen is a better movie than 'Amelie', butit will appeal very well to people who'd rather live in a differentuniverse. It picks up real, living humans and uses them like toys, liketerminally uninformed parodies of humanity. It squanders reality. Seethat bar-maid there? That actress playing her is probably a fascinatingwoman - I'm SURE she's a fascinating woman - people tend heavily to befascinating. Sadly though, this cartoon of a movie allows nomanifestation of any side of any of its performers' personalities toshow through at any point. I have never, ever been more infuriated by amovie. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's previous film was 'Alien: Resurrection',which goes part-way, but not all the way, in explaining how this movieis as bad as it is. Although there is ever so much more to be said, that's about all I'mgoing to say about 'Amelie'. I'd like to tell you that this is becausethe film's Hadesian wretchedness is beyond my ability to properlydescribe, but that would constitute a falsehood on the scale of'Amelie'. The truth is that I am dismayed by the idea of exerting anymore mental energy contemplating this grotesque puppet show. That thefilm receives such unbroken acclaim is a dreary testament to the desireof so very many people to escape from any form of recognizable life.For Jean-Pierre Jeunet to spit in my face would be so much kinder thanwhat he did to me by making this movie it would constitute anatonement.(Note: Buried in the film's sound-track is one of the greatest songsI've ever heard; a version of 'Guilty' sung by Albert Bowlly in 1931.An acquaintance haplessly gave this film to me, and afterwards I toldher that, although it was the single most detestable film I'd everseen, without it I'd surely have gone the rest of my days withouthaving heard that sublime melody, and was grateful to her. Myrelationship with that song will end only at the hour of my death,unlike my relationship with this film and its director, whichterminates with the completion of this sentence.)"
919,2016-obamas-america-movie,Marlene,10,"As a Democrat who voted mostly within party lines, many questions throughout these last 4 years which have devastated our Middle class and obvious to those who astute that it was not caused by Bush.  This President had total control the first 2 years and did nothing buy harm the middle class . How ignorant he believes the masses are..and he is the only competent one, not even needing to meet daily with his cabinet, as he also smarter than they are. THANK GOODNESS FOR THIS HONEST DOCUMENTARY. THE FEAR TACTICS OF THE RADICAL LEFT TO NOT SEE THIS IS EVIDENT. THEY ALSO BELIEVING IN THE IGNORANCE OF THE MASSES AND THE NEED OF THE MASSES TO BE CONTROLLED BY THEM. This is a documentary that is history making for it's honesty in researching with interviews and a timeline for all those history buffs to scrutinize themselves. All will see how brilliant this type of reality has been brought to the screen. I do hope the scare tactics and fear of the Presidency does not hit the general public, as they have wanted believing the average Joe is unable to think for themselves, needing the Presidents direction as in Cuba....If you are able to think without direction as to what to think, then see this movie and think for yourself..."
920,the-1517-to-paris-movie,ShowMeMore,3,"I was extremely disappointed in this film.  Everybody has their 15 minutes of fame (and not to diminish the heroism of the actual heroes) but I struggled to find 15 minutes of enjoyment in this film.

922,frailty-movie,ariel84,2,"matthew mconaughey being rust cohle, that is, acting inscrutable, showing little emotion, and coming off as nicely creepy years before he realized roles like this were his calling. he's the only reason to watch the film. m. night shymalan covered this these far more effectively in ""unbreakable""."
923,it-might-get-loud-movie,Countvontrollio,0,"The SanFrancisco critic review is right on the money. This film is an abject failure and colossal waste of time. As nothing happens when the disparate group of guitarists meet, the film is then turned into a by the numbers brief doco on why each member got into music. The result is really dull because there is no unifying theme to the disparate acts. It fails as a love ode to the guitar also and is really an example of a very weak vague idea executed poorly.Ultimately, a super boring turgid experience."
924,wolf-creek-movie,VictoriaD,2, It was borrible. biggest waste of 105 minutes. I cant believe they actually have it playing in a theatre. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
925,the-last-airbender-movie,mgastryker,2,"I am a huge fan of the animated series. I absolutely hated this movie. There is really no similarity between this movie and the series. First, in the series, Aang is a happy-go-lucky kid. In the movie, there is no joy to be found anywhere. Second, bending doesn't require five minutes of dancing before a single move can be made. In the series, a flick of the wrist throws a rock. In the movie, the characters have to go through rigorous dance moves just to levitate some water. Third, the series cannot actually be made into a movie because the movie can't encompass all of the little details the series had to offer. All in all, nothing in this movie lives up to the series."
926,slow-west-movie,foxgrove,2,"The slow in the title is the perfect adjective for this arty western about a love struck boy and a bounty hunter who become companions whilst searching for the same girl, although for entirely different reasons. The film’s destination, however, becomes almost irrelevant as the lack of any real dramatic incident leaves one completely indifferent to where events are heading.Despite a manageable running time this journey becomes something of an endurance test that even the talents of Michael Fassbender and Ben Mendelsohn can do nothing to enliven. What little back story there is doesn’t answer questions like why the girl is an outlaw; how the boy knew how to find her, and how he got from Scotland to America considering his naiveté and lack of funds. A few moments do manage to stir one to attention and the beautiful New Zealand locations and a haunting score provide some compensation. Also, as the boy, Kodi Smit-McPhee gives a likeable and sympathetic performance. Unfortunately, though, these positives aside the film just isn’t either different enough or interesting enough to be memorable."
927,meeks-cutoff-movie,DKay,2,"Critic dudes, wtf?! This movie blew. Tortorously tedious. Love and respect for MW but the story was pathetic. A 6th grade play at best. An 86??!! Stay away, people."
928,indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull-movie,SlyF.,8, I was not hyped and thus not dissatisfied at all. Indy 4 is a fun 148 min of escapism.

932,the-shallows-movie,EpicLadySponge,2,"A stupid, tired movie that tries to give sharks back their names of what they were when Jaws was released back in 1975 but eventually sinks itself straight to the ocean where it eventually gets forgotten by day two."
933,schindlers-list-movie,ChadS.,10," This is the only movie I have ever given a perfect ten. Schindler's List is, to put it simply, the best, most well-done, overal greateset movie of our time. It's acting, editing, and directing are done to perfection. Spielsber has proven himself to be a master when it comes to films just by this movie alone. The character of Oskar Schindler could not have been played better, and as the movie progresses you begin to love him as not only just another actor in just another movie, but also as a person. Schindler is a real-life hero, and this movie does his life justice. Your emotions will be tied into this film, and you will never forget it. Excellent, excellent movie. Thank-you. Please watch, no matter who you are."
934,brokeback-mountain-movie,MayF.,10, Great acting by both Heath & Jake. Both gave a marvelous performance!
935,frozen-2013-movie,W4RL0CK,3,"Some elements in Frozen were good, such as individual characters and even the songs are okay in their own little ways, but the story was lackluster and uninspired, the only moments I felt any sort of story was near the end, and went very slowly through the beginning. I've always been a Disney fan but Frozen just didn't keep my attention and quickly got boring. It's slowly progressing and anti-climactic, and unless your a little kid, it wont keep your attention for more than a few minutes."
936,inception-movie,JudithR.,1," One note movie-- mostly an unvarying level of all- out action throughout, and loud, bombastic soundtrack too, so it gets more and more boring to sit through. Not all dream sequences needed to be like Nazi horror dreams; but the few scenes in which Nolan introduced less noisy interactions were short and not very engaging. Not for thoughtful viewers."
937,hancock-movie,DavidC.,3, A tedious movie that has some moments. Some of the foreshadowing was a bit raw since the characters should have picked up on such obvious ques.
938,22-jump-street-movie,reginaldwam3,8,"The whole script is self aware enough that never let the predictably horrible plot get in the way of many great gags. This move is about the gags, and they provide the entertainment in what is a very funny movie. And they really came through with an actually funny, 3rd act action scene. That said, a love of dumb guy humor is prerequisite to enjoying this movie."
939,the-fast-and-the-furious-6-movie,gdave11,9,"any franchise in its sixth film usually gets boring and you see the same old thing, not with this. This film is the sixth in the fast and furious franchise, fast and furious began with street racing and lunatics with cars,it is still true to its roots but as the franchise went on something needed to change and the direction they have gone in is done so well, i must say i wasn't expecting much but it gave a very engaging story, brilliant action and street races (can't be a fast and furious film without it can it!), everybody acts their part, appearances from the Rock and Vin Diesel are not there just to show off their muscles, everybody acts well and i did not want to leave my seat for one second. But no film is perfect, i felt some characters deaths were not needed  and one scene in particular where the crew are chasing a plane down an airfield, the airfield seemed to never end and was a bit ridiculous. But honestly i would recommend this film to anybody, you do not need to see fast and furious 5 (i did not) to understand it refers back to it in certain parts so you understand why certain things happen. Great film go see"
940,black-panther-movie,Dodger,3,"Unfortunately I found this movie sub par in pretty much every respect. The story line was slow and dragged out. The action was really hit and miss, with laughable power differences between characters (an armoured rhino was considered the hidden ""power"" weapon of the movie). Additionaly they killed of the two most interesting characters of the black panther Universe in this film ""Killemonger"" and ""Klaw"", easily the two most charismatic and well acted roles in this movie. The storyline was oddly racist towards people not of African descent, I know I know its a ficitonal African country, but still, its an odd message to have as the major plot point of the film.The only major posoitive that i found i had for this film were the visual effects, the ""sand/Dust?"" hologram tech was really well done.Apart from this you can easily give this film a miss, as it contibutes next to nothing to the MCU, part from taking away two of its best characters. (Literaly nothing happens, the end of the film leaves the story in the same palce as the start of it)"
941,lion-movie,pdw123,3,"Watching this finally on DVD in 2018, this seemed way overhyped and way too sentimental, maudlin.  The adoptive parents seem a little too perfect, and the college buds too trendy, unreal.  It definitely does not have the grit and authenticity that made ""Slumdog Millionaire"" so famous and it will never be as good as that film.That said, the fact that it IS a true story is amazing, the reason for my non zero vote at least.  But, come on Nicole Kidman, her character plays out like something on the Lifetime channel.  Even her performance with Cruise--and I abhor Cruise--and pot smoking offered us more depth, alas the great Kubrick the taskmaster in his final film.  But, Nicole just seems to be marking time and money here.  This is not an artistic nor an AA worthy film."
942,star-wars-episode-i---the-phantom-menace-movie,nahtan1244,3,"I Love star wars. It's been a crucial part of my childhood and beyond. I fondly remember watching the prequels and thinking they were gods of a movie. It's not so much the case today. The thing about the phantom meance is Geroge lucas is a great story teller. He has some excellent ideas that made the foundations of the story great but it was just executed very poorly. Too much exposition, Jar Jar, whoever thought he would make a great general? weird stereotyping in the voices, wooden acting all across the board. Seriously queen admadala barley cracks a smile and the way she delivers her lines make me want to go to sleep. The only good thing That makes this a 3 is the lifghsaber fight plus as I mentioned before the great outlying of the story. I think George lucas is a great story teller but he can't put his thoughts into action and make it a great movie. That's why the original trilogy was so good. Even though he inly made one star wars movie he wrote the story for all 3 and they were fantastic. I admire George lucas. I feel bad as he had to prepare for alot of backlash sense episode 1 and even if he is not a perfect director I thank him wholeheartedly for bringing star wars into my life and I am glad he was able to share it with his vision. all I have left to say is thank you lucas for not ruining my childhood but creating it."

944,reservoir-dogs-movie,Jacob,7,For a first film its good. The characters are interesting and the story is engaging. The choice to tell the story out of order makes me want to rewatch the film as I feel like it’ll make more sense the second time around.
945,interstellar-movie,foxgrove,3,"Here we go again reviewing yet another failed giant which clocks in at a butt numbing 169 minutes. It's an ambitious but flawed venture that is big in concept, big in budget and explores  big themes. Sadly what this all adds up to is a big disappointment. The story, full of as many holes as there are black ones in space, is a mish mash of ideas which never really gel and one never quite gets a hold of what the point of it all is. The actors don't offer much by way of compensation either. Anne Hathaway shouldering the worst of the dialogue is the biggest casualty here, but Michael Caine is also tiresome as is Matt Damon who adds nothing. Matthew McConnaughey is better, but whatever emotion or empathy the film generates, and there are some very moving moments, are purely due to the wonderful Jessica Chastain. The film's biggest asset is her performance, although it's good to see film legend Ellen Burstyn showing all the others how it's done in just one tiny scene. The banal dialogue is often gibberish and causes the rolling of one's eyes in disbelief or embarrassment. Nearly all scenes are over extended and often one is inclined to tune out long before they are finished. The special effects are good, but aside from a couple of sequences (a huge wave and the final set piece involving McConnaughey and Chastain),there really isn't much that we haven't seen before. The music comes on strong and sounds like an extended version of Mike Oldfield's 'Tubular Bells' from 1973's 'The Exorcist', co incidentally starring Burstyn in one of her finest roles. The sound is very loud and effective during the set pieces, but is then often inaudible during simple dialogue exchanges between characters. I have no idea what Anne Hathaway was mumbling at the end in so pained a manner.There are some marvellous compositions of the outside of the spacecraft filmed in complete silence, which are then judiciously cut with the sound included inside the ship. More of this and less dialogue would have been appreciated all round. Another gimmick that serves little purpose was the almost inevitable inclusion of the robot TARS. I would have recommended the removal of his power pack. Director Christopher Nolan is certainly full of ideas but, unfortunately, they are never fully realised. He comes over like a young boy trying to communicate a passion or a hobby that no one else gets. His direction is over indulgent and left me confused and bored. Perhaps after two dramatic failures (Inception was very similar in style, but an even worse film!) he should try his hand at comedy. After all laughter in a cinema in infinitely preferable to sleeping."
946,now-you-see-me-movie,annbd,2,"That is what you call 'unlikable' characters. Plus they all acted with some out-of-space arrogance, that were all the way of the movie. And I actually don't know how they all did that, I mean did the director told them to act like rebel-teens who think they are the best? However the whole movie was a disaster. It wasn't interesting at all. Even the voice of Morgan Freeman couldn't save it. It was like a cheap movie - not a little money is invested, but some visuals can't replace screenplay (dialogues.. so poor), one good actor can't compensate 5 fools, who can't act at all and so on.. And no point in the movie, no meaning. Crap."
947,dead-man-down-movie,ClayMerritt,7,"Despite all of its hate, its a pretty good movie. Oplov takes all the good actors that he has corralled around him and manages to insert mean &amp; gritty action, along with its revenge plot. All of it clicked and worked to make a very enjoyable film. It wasn't the best, by any means, and certainly could have been better, but for what it was, it was exciting and fun."
948,ghostbusters-2016-movie,AthanasiosT,2,"Thank you Metacritic for the user reviews and I promise, I'll take them into account next time I'll watch a movie. About Ghostbusters 2016, all I can say is they really took a big p00p on the earlier films. My main problem was I couldn't find what was wrong with the film : writing, acting, directing ? Why wasn't I smiling at all ? Final verdict : if it worked in the past, don't mess with it and leave it buried (it's the same with the SW saga,really...)"
949,white-chicks-movie,kevin,2," This film was one of the worst films i've ever seen. The humour was awfully stupid and the whole premise was pretty much racist......can anyone imagine the uproar if it was two white guy's dressed up as black chicks???? it would never be made! also...while i'm on the subject, can you imagine a tv station called White Entertainment? double standards exist in the US today."
950,bridge-of-spies-movie,ryan_goz,9,As expected another stunning film by Spielberg with an immaculate script that completely envelopes you in the past and helps you understand the motives of both the Soviet Union and the United States. Tom Hanks portrays his character with humility and grace whilst keeping his intentions pure. A truly Oscar worthy performance by Mark Rylance who makes you feel for his character and the struggles he experiences. Steven Spielberg and the Coen Brothers make an effective team and have created a faithful adaptation of the cold war era.

953,x-men-the-last-stand-movie,ArthurM.,2,"A terrible bit of screen writing. too much information thrown into one story. new characters like, jugganaut, beast, kitty, and angel have little if any character development. certain classic x-men storylines are patched together with little logic included. the direction and acting are satisfactory but even the great work of patrick stewart and sir ian mckellen cannot save this horrid piece of writing. i hope this will be an example to film studios that they shouldnt put successful movie franchises with immense potential in the hands of third rate writers, whose shining glory is penning xxx: state of the union, inspector gadget, and electra."

957,the-post-movie,Mustarda,9,"A movie with Hanks and Streep is already an assurance of at least some class acting, but the movie is much more than that. It managed to live much above their magistral performances. Once again Spielberg chooses the perfect timing for his movie, freedom of speech and real news is so much ""in the news"" today that it was refreshing to see real life champions. It's a pivotal moment in history and it was directed with such craft that will keep you in a permanent trance of emotions until the end. One of the best movies I've seen from 2017, highly recommended."

960,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,FallsDownz,7,"Well i think this is gonna be kind a weird that i gave The Force Awakens only 7 out of 10 but please hear my perspective. Okay i must admit i'm not really a Star Wars fan (or Star Trek neither if you wonder) i'm just a movie maniac but i must admit Star Wars is a special franchise it's not only the franchise that huge amount of people love but it's the franchise that inspire a lot of movies today. So after i take that out of the way let's go the my thoughts of The Force Awakens i think it's a pretty good movie but great or perfect ? not really The bright site is this is probably exactly what Star Wars fan wants not only the return of franchise they love but the return of something big something Epic and J.J. Abrams definitely delivers that he proof once again that he's such a visionary director his creativity and storytelling is just so good not only that the movie epic but he just doing such a perfect job of introducing new character to the universe and make those character so interesting , without a doubt J.J. Abrams brings the old Star Wars fan know and love back and fill it with a new exciting energy like a Phoenix that came back from ashes Now here's come the dark site The Force Awakens is not perfect it's a flaws and a huge one too and that's the villain the bad guy the dark power or whatever you want to call them, while the new hero character introduce really well and so much interesting the new 'bad guy' is pretty bland repetitive and predictable which is kind a weird since J.J. latest work Star Trek Into Darkness has such an amazing villain The thing is this part hurts, not only it makes the movie kind a less interesting since the bad guy is kind a boring and predictable it's just makes a HUGE and i mean HUGE surprise not memorable as it should be which is kind a shame since this plot twisted part should really just blow me out of the window but instead i saw it coming from a mile away (especially if you always read news about future Star Wars movie from Disney) One of the main reason why the villain in The Force Awakens is in this state is because of it's actual script it's just so repetitive almost everything you saw have been done before and because of Disney plan of Future Star Wars sequel it's hurts even more since they can't really go too far in this film and that's make everything seems so simple so repetitive there's no real interesting conflict it's just Light vs Dark , Good vs Evil once again and that's like kind a let down consider J.J. Abrams is a director But in the end Star Wars: The Force Awakens still a fun popcorn movie it's a movie that you will feel like 30 minutes more than 2 hours + it's fun it's entertaining it's kind a worth your movie ticket price but unfortunately it's only do that, it's never really challenge or offer something new and that's make The Force Awakens not as memorable as it should be."

It was made by a bunch of Sexist Pigs and should go back to the hell from which it was spawned."
963,the-artist-movie,A_Northerner,8,"I sat down to watch The Artist with a certain degree of apprehension, it was the first black and white or silent film I have ever really watched. Sadly these factors put off Mrs Media Worm so I watched it solo. The Artist is like no other film I have seen (stating the obvious) before, in the same way I often lean towards black and white photography, I found the lack of colour enhanced the film's stylish presentation. After a short time I forgot I was watching a film with no dialogue, and enjoyably so.  Ludovic Bource's score sublimely supports the cast, with necessary dialogue provided by the occasional old fashioned dialogue intertitles.  Before seeing the film, I'll be honest, I was sceptical of the film's hype, especially seeing actors unknown to a wide audience wining awards for Best Actor, but Jean Dujardin's performance as the proud, egocentric star George Valentin is as wonderful as I have seen lately. Dujardin seems built for silent film where expressions count for so much, ironic given the film's story. The contrast between his over-acted performances as the silent film actor and his toned down but still expression led performance as an actor in what is a silent film is subtle but fascinating. Berenice Bejo is just as rapturous as Peppy Miller and together the two are enchanting. Considering the film is French, I was surprised by the faces that popped up amongst the supporting cast, notably John Goodman, Malcom McDowell and James Cromwell. Credit must also go to Uggie the dog, probably now the most famous on screen canine since Snowy. Academy Award Best Director Michel Hazanavicius includes some stylish shots, my favourite being the shot of George and Peppy talking on the stairway of the Bradway Building while extras busily move around them on all levels at a seemingly faster speed. The film's plot is actually a sombre, simple little romance story where very little actually happens but what does transpire does so leisurely, at an easy going pace, as befits the time."
964,bridge-of-spies-movie,EpicLadySponge,8,"Steven Spielberg's back into movie directing and this time, he made us love his Bridge of Spies movie starring the legendary Tom Hanks. He gave us what's worth to make this movie lovable."
965,north-country-movie,Dean,8," Charlize Theron gives an excellent performance in the lead rol, story captivating and excellent performances by the other cast members with many of them previous OSCar winners. I hope they make moore films like this in the future. You will not waste 2 hours of you life watching this film. I hope more female directors get to do movies like this written for women. I get sick of male directors forcing the lead actors to get their clothes off (especially women) when it has nothing relevant to do with the pricture except to get bums on seats to see the movie, in a male dominated director Hollywood industry."

969,suburbicon-movie,Proteus,0,Epic directorial fail. Good writing yes. Good acting yes. Good production yes. Really really bad directing choices yes. Clooney has one talent - making friends with talented people. He is not charming. He is below average acting. He is a bad director. And he supports guys like Roman Polanski who happens to be a child rapist. Clooney is a good example of what America hates about Hollywood. Go see a Miles Teller movie instead of this mess.
970,crazy-stupid-love-movie,TheWhiteStripes,8,"This film was one of the few movies I payed for, and actually got a great impression from it. Leaving the theater; I was still amazed at the multiple characters and multiple story lines that all came into one. Watching them crashing into each-other close to the end was genius! Put Terrence Malick and comedy together and you'll get something like this."
971,blue-valentine-movie,Onear,8,"I am absolutely baffled that Ryan Gosling didn't get a Best Actor nomination for this and Michelle Williams did.  Don't get me wrong, I thought she did a very good job too, but it didn't compare to Gosling, who I think is quite underrated.  The story is told in a non-chronological, retrospective view.  But the order and direction of the story is the most beautiful part.  It is kept a bit mysterious, but easy to follow and understand where in the story you happen to be. The middle of the film did drag out and it didn't have to be a 2 hour movie.  The most memorable scene was when they were walking and started singing and dancing.  I think it was the apex of their relationship and showed that they could be happy together.  It gave them that little bit of hope in their minds that they could hold onto their relationship and work it out. Overall it's a good story with good acting."
972,suicide-squad-movie,HTGamer,1,"Suicide Squad is pure garbage in every department.Jared Leto's The Joker is reduced to some tattooed guy with golden teeth and cadenas, at least he is a psychopath and maniac as always but is mostly absent from this movie. Will Smith's Deadshot is a decent and grounded character. Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn is better than I expected, but still not great. Everything and everyone else though is garbage.Who on their right mind, let alone a government, would recruit a band of sentenced criminals, murderers and super villains as disposable assets to conduct black ops and save the world? Yep, that's the idea, even in the comics. As for the movie's plot, don't bother. It's by far the silliest movie plot I have ever experienced."
973,pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl-movie,DrewtheDude85,8,"The first installment of the POTC Movie franchise is a very fun and very enjoyable film to watch. It has a fun and enjoyable cast of characters, a good story and some cool atmospheres. Another thing about this film is that I like all the references this film makes to the Disneyland attraction it was based off making this seem like a good ""tribute"" film in a way. One thing I will say about this film, however, is the action and fighting scenes is a little repetitive in a way, but over all it was mostly good. POTC: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a very good film that no one should miss out on. I'd recommend it."

Regardless, I can't remember what happened at the end. For me, it's equal to the the Dark Knight. A bit more talking and less laughter. But Bane doesn't need to live up to the last villain, he could care less about him. Only the Dark Knight needs to live up to his former self, and this he struggles with."

You'd think that would be easy, but I've seen a lot of movies that can't pull it off.  Anne Hathaway is such a good actress and this role gives her a lot of range.

978,guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie,DCEdmonds,8,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" 10 Scale Rating: 7.5 (Very Good) ... The Good: After several super serious Marvel films (with comedic elements), it was refreshing to see a lighter one. Guardians of the Galaxy doesn't take itself too seriously and is just flat out fun. The effects are fantastic, as expected, and the film is colorful and visually stunning. The characters are also well done and Gunn did a good job making you care about this band of outlaws as they come together to save the universe. Unlike the Avengers, which had several films to help you get to know the team before it existed, the characters are introduced and the team is formed in just two hours. I was dubious that they could pull it off and was pleasantly surprised that they did so and then some. Lee Pace's Ronan the Accuser (the main villain in the film) was among the better Marvel villains in the MCU despite not having a slew of lines. He was dark, powerful, and intimidating. Lastly, there are plenty of Easter Eggs for comic book fans as the film was designed with audiences of all kinds in mind. Despite being set in it's own niche and far from Earth, the film ties into the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe very well. The Bad: While I enjoyed the light tone, the humor becomes a little much sometimes. The slapstick and random comedic moments can be a little off-putting and forced. The one-liners almost felt constant as well. I wasn't a fan of Micheal Rooker in the film as his character just felt like a blue-skinned Merle from Walking Dead. Lastly, I would have liked to have seen more from Karen Gillan's Nebula. I felt that she was woefully under-utilized. Maybe next time? A very good Marvel film, but not quite among the best."
979,transformers-the-last-knight-movie,timao,0,"I just watched this movie last night and I cannot, for life of me, remember what exactly was going on or what the main story is.

987,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,Big_Bear,3,"Hugely disappointing, but predictably so. By far the worst Star Wars film ever made that no serious Star Wars fan could ever enjoy. Let me just say, I am a massive Star Wars fan; not so much of the movies as most are a mess but I love the lore and the world that has been created. The movies often do not tell the story that a universe as vast as Star Wars deserve and this rubbish is no different. The first thing I noticed was the acting of the two 'newcomers' - it really is awful, not helped by a terrible script. The chap who plays Finn is particularly laughable with his supremely stupid reactions to everything that happens around him - there is a noise 'what was that?', someone comes into a room 'who just came in?' it really is ridiculous. This can in part be papered over by the fact his character has been raised as a stormtrooper and knows nothing else blah, blah, blah, but really it's just awful acting and writing. These two really were unknown for a reason. The heroine Rey, is only marginally better but again, suffers from the writing,  with her character being possibly the most stereotypical ever conceived. Angry, down on her luck etc etc and then predictably 'blossoms' throughout the movie to get behind the cause, all very tired and has been done countless times before. The 'plot', if it can even be called that,  again, is laughably bad, an almost exact copy of A New Hope but not as good. It really makes you wonder where they got the guys to write this, my guess is that they must have been 'unknowns' as well. If you hadn't seen this movie you really wouldn't believe the plot was so close to the first film - Empire creates super weapon but has plans stolen by rebels who at the end of the movie manage to exploit the weakness they found in said plans, all the while a young nobody from a backwater planet becomes a large part of the rebellion unexpectedly' - it really is the EXACT same! It also cannot be saved by the side plot involving the search for Luke Skywalker, the stolen plans revealing his location the only real difference in the stories. There is also a quite frankly, disgusting amount of fan service in the movie which I'm sure has been included just as much for the service as it has to save the writers from coming up with anything remotely original. Han and Chewie, the Falcon, a planet very closely resembling Tatooine, it all becomes a bit of a bore. Finally I come to the most irritating thing about the whole movie - the duel at the end between Rey and Kylo Ren, and it's lead up. Yes, there are lore destroying, stupid moments in other Star Wars movies (Padme's age, how easy Palpatine kills 3 Jedi, the stupidness of how Anakin becomes Vader) but this one might trump them all. Unlike any other Star Wars film or any lore, both Rey and Finn become proficient in lightsaber combat the second they pick one up! Yes, apparently no training is required, contrary to absolutely everything we've read or seen in any other Star Wars material. This is ridiculous enough, but it comes to a ludicrous head when Rey, with absolutely zero training, manages to defeat Kylo Ren, a Sith Lord trained for years in lightsaber combat. If I didn't watch it on a plane I would have walked out right there. The only good points were Kylo Ren, by a country mile the most interesting character and the one with the most potential and depth. Supreme leader Snoke, although basically playing the part of the Emperor also interested me and I'm eager to see more of them both. To sum up, I really find it hard to believe any true Star Wars fan could actually say this movie is anything but awful. A huge disappointment and basically a lore destroying, ridiculous remake of a New Hope, that, despite the special effects, is nowhere near as good."
988,what-lies-beneath-movie,Erik_Imsen,1,"What lies beneath? Definitely the most impressive and comprehensive collection of cliches, nonsense absurdities and boring moments ever assembled in this pretentious couldn't-possibly-be-slower film. Nothing happens for the first 90 minutes. Pfeiffer wanders in her home trying to look troubled, has pointless encounters with neighbors, plays some ouija with a friend and from time to time exchanges with Ford some dull dialogue that sounds anything but realistic. And when filming nothing seems to have reached it's limits, well, you just get some more. The final twist doesn't come as a surprise -remember, you had 90' to try and guess it out, nothing was happening on the screen- and the final confrontation is sooooo ludicrous that it keeps me wondering if it has been stolen from the Scary Movie franchise. But surprisingly, I actually rather enjoyed the ending. It gets hysterical as every step seems to have been written under the strict rule of ""of all options my characters have, what would be the least logical or probable?"" This pure overdose of nonsense situations gets really funny, and comes as a nice and more than welcomed frustration relief after sitting through nearly two hours of pretentious pseudo hitchcokian homage. (I know I got Sir Alfred's last name spelled wrong, but it keeps being deleted by some poorly encoded ""Politically Correct"" protection stuff that doesn't seem to stand the second syllable of Hitchco)"
989,inside-out-2015-movie,tjman09,10,"Inside Out is a funny, heartwarming, and deep journey into the human mind. Pixar has a filmography that's hard to match, and things will remain that way if they keep putting out films of this caliber. As per usual the story is well crafted, and inventive, but the most impressive thing is the use of humor to help the moments of true drama. By that I mean the film has a relatable humor, that anybody can laugh at and have a good time with, so when the film decides to get serious it hits the audience even deeper. This something Pixar's always been good at, but this movie has some of the most touching moments since Up. On top of the brilliant use of humor, the visuals are stunning, the voice acting is perfect, and the characters are surprisingly well crafted. In the end Inside Out is one of Pixar's best films in the last 5 years, and is worth seeing on the big screen."

The majority of the jokes failed to make me even smile while I got insanely bored with the serious side of the film when we're supposed to be seeing Madea, given the title of the movie.

The entire cast gives exceptional performances and there is no weak link, it's as if each actor raised the other to the next level. The best example of this is with Emma Stone who gives her best performance to date. Stone goes head to head with veterans like Michael Keaton and Edward Norton and stays right there with them. The true highlight of Birdman is the cinematography by the genius that is Emmanuel Lubezki, after receiving his much deserved first Oscar for Gravity just a year ago he will surely win another this year for his superb work.

That phrase was never used until the '90s. Seems like it was written by a 30 year old who had no idea what he was doing."
1002,casino-royale-movie,AnonymousMC,0,"I can't believe the raving critiques for this film. This was not only the worst James Bond I ever saw, it was also one of the worst film I saw. Everybody over-seriousness, plotless story, gratuitous violence, incomprehensible dialogues. An utter waste of (over-long) time and money. I actually feel cheated and robbed."
1003,how-to-lose-friends-alienate-people-movie,AlexJ.,2, The amusement factor of the film seemed to be in inverse proportion to the success of Pegg's character. Are we supposed to actually be rooting for this moron? The love story with Dunst was horribly contrived as well.
1004,an-inconvenient-truth-movie,AlD,9," Undoubtedly, there is a little too much self-mythologising from Gore in the film (and I am of a liberal persuasion). Sure there's a need to have some relief from the stats and charts, but the point of the film is what it has to say, not the guy who's saying it. That aside, this is an incredibly important film that should persuade every viewer to make changes in their lives to reduce their impact on climate change - its conclusions are just too stark to ignore."
1005,the-wolf-of-wall-street-movie,Jamison12,9,"I was absolutely blown away by this film. Scorsese just executed it perfectly. I believe this is without a doubt DiCaprio's best film and one of Jonah Hill's best films. It's engaging to all audiences and it keeps you hooked for all 3 hours of it's running time. You know Belfort is a sleezeball, but you find yourself cheering for him. This can only be done by DiCaprio perfectly capturing Belfort's intended charisma."
1006,spider-movie,Eon,9," Great acting, great directing, great puzzle. ;)"
1007,cloverfield-movie,NK,2," This movie tries so hard to be cool and gritty and different but fails on all but one of those goals. Gritty is about the only compliment it gets, if you can call grainy footage and cameras that shake epileptically ""gritty"". The introduction to characters drags, the action sequences are unsatisfying and the ending is a complete dud. And be warned: if watching the ""Handycam-esque"" style of Blair Witch Project made you feel a little queasy, Cloverfield will have you reaching for, and filling, the bucket. Blurgh!"
1008,transformers-the-last-knight-movie,SirEpicPigeon,8,I honestly don't get all the hate on this movie. This was the first Transformers movie we've had in a while that did something original. The Transformers woven through our history combined with the new setting our cast will have to traverse in this movie was a joy to watch. Yes I think you have to be a fan of these movies to be able to enjoy this one. Still I think this movie gets way too much hate
1009,live-free-or-die-hard-movie,Kyle,3," Heartbreaking... I love the Die Hard movies but this is a real stinker. So much of what made the others great was the location becoming one of the characters. Here, there is no central stage for all the action. Also, Bruce seems so grumpy and depressed through the whole film that his one-liners come off as failed attempts to become his old lovable self. The stunts were not suitable for Die Hard and belonged in a Schwarzenegger flick. Finally, though there is lot's more crap to talk about, the editing was pure rubbish. How many times can we have dialog out of sync with actors mouths. There was no smooth flow to this film. It's a big stinky, burning paper bag full of doggy-do."
1010,i-robot-movie,ArshdeepB.,10, This movie was a thrilling movie with a very good twist at the end and good backstory behind Sponner's actions.

1012,the-matrix-movie,jacobshoff,10,"The Matrix is an awesome movie. I mean it's really the thinking man's action movie. What the wachowski brothers did with this film was amazing. The Kung-Fu action sequences were incredible, done to perfection. plus the bullet time sequences were  so cool, nothing else compares. I just loved this awesome  man's movie. Love it, Love it."
1013,the-wrestler-movie,MattA,9," Fantastic Performance by Rourke. This sad, and slightly predictable, story is touching and moving for those who have ever felt useless in their life. When you can step back and ask yourself, ""Why am i here? What am I worth?"" then this movie is for you."
1014,thoroughbreds-movie,tylerkellr,10,"Thoroughbreds is a fascinating movie in a number of ways.  The cinematography is slow, patient, and at all times purposeful.  Never is a shot wasted in this movie.  The soundtrack is likewise intent on imbuing the viewer with a certain uneasiness throughout.  But the real star here (and no surprise coming from an adapted play) is the character study and superb scripting from Cory Finley.  At times approaching Juno (2007) levels of quirkiness, the writing also never fails to also feel grounded and real for the two central characters.  The entire story is very much the investigation of the relationship between Lily and Amanda, and the way in which their characters grow closer as they toy with the life-changing act of murder.  ""It doesn't make me a bad person, it just means I have to try a little harder to be good"" says the sociopathic Amanda, and in every scene of the movie, this is her driving philosophy.  She feels nothing - no guilt, no pain, and, tragically, no joy - and yet she constantly endeavors to do what she sees as right.  She confesses to faking her tears after the death of Lily's father, but it wasn't done out of any malice or in any attempt to manipulate her.  She did so simply to comfort Lily in her sorrow, even if she had none of her own.  The final line of the movie is a gut-punch, and I'll admit to at first feeling cheated by what felt like a flippant, unfair conclusion.  But the real (or perhaps just my understood) meaning hit me on the drive home.  I realized that the ending, much like Annihilation (another fantastic film I would recommend), and likely much like Hereditary later this year will be, deals with an inheritance of character, or traits.  Lily has effectively grown into Amanda - not actively evil, and perhaps not even actively good like Amanda.  It's a film that begs discussion - over Lily's abandonment of Amanda, over Amanda's sacrifice for Lily.  None of the events in the movie are fully black and white, and I think it's the realness and honesty that director Cory Finley maintains even through the ambiguity and uncertainty that really elevates this to something great."
1015,the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-movie,pryingmantis,10,"THE 48FPS IS PERFECTLY FINE AND AMAZING. (I wanted to say that first because all the idiotic critic reviews of the framerate making them sick almost deterred me from going) The fps does take about twenty minutes to get adjusted to, but when you get used to it everything looks amazing. The best looking CGI I have ever seen. Regarding the story line it was a tiny bit slow during the beginning, but can anyone say all parts of every lotr movie were 100% interesting and captivating? No. Once the movie picks up its a fantastic adventure with TONS of action, great dialogue, fantastic musical score reminiscent of LOTR and stunning cinematography. Don't compare this to LOTR, because it's not meant to be. It's an epic adventure in its own right. I watched this movie in 3D 48FPS and i plan to watch it many more times in exactly the same setting. Movies are meant to be this."
1016,ong-bak-movie,AGYP,9,"If I were to rate this movie just on the action, I'd give it a 10, but looking at the whole story line, it's a bit lame. Tong Jaa has some real talent, would be nice to get him to Hollywood someday."
1017,wolf-creek-movie,MikeA.,2," A truly awful movie. The previews looked great. With its delayed release, I was thrilled to pay $10 to see it on opening day. This must be one of the absolute worst movies I'd ever seen. There goes an hour and a half of my life totally wasted!"
1018,sin-city-a-dame-to-kill-for-movie,rafafetter,3,"Some great visuals and a lot of style... and that's pretty much it... Bad dialogues, some terrible special effects and a movie that just drags on.. Not a good sequel,.. at all..."
1019,all-is-lost-movie,netflic,8,"There is only one character is this movie played by Robert Redford. He is all by himself on a boot in the Indian Ocean. The whole movie is about his fight for life.Almost no words except a few exclamations but the movie is full with dramatism. Beautiful cinematography and music. In my opinion, the movie is not a piece of entertainment. Is it piece of art? Definitely. One can easily predict Redfort will be nominated for the Oscar's best actor for this role, and rightfully so."
1020,the-little-death-movie,LeZee,9,"Enlightenment from the strange desires. I don't know where to begin, this movie was unexpected. It was a multi layered tale, somewhat all characters were connected, but all the story centers around the same theme and that is sexual fantasies. What happens when mismatch in desire get together for life. Counselling is the part of recovery nowadays, but everything lies in the effort that put on the practical side. So this movie takes such a wonderful journey with one less than half a dozen of pairs rides towards seeking solutions and answers for their wish. But the thing is, like the most of the movie's punchline say 'how far would you go for it?' is the movie that reveals to us. It was a brilliantly written for the screen and so the actors, who did their parts impeccably. The narration was so distinct in each tale and also had very good twists before the wrap up. It was a better movie than most of the sex comedies that we got fooled for its promotions. I won't surprise if Hollywood or other film industry remake it. Why do we need to read 'Kama Sutra' while this movie is out there. Definitely there won't be a better movie for adults to enjoy whole heartily, especially not recently as I'm aware. Finally, without minors around, but for ourself to have a great time. Don't think it is a build-up because it delivers a good entertainment with lots of 'laugh out lauds'. ''Also, I'm required by federal law to inform you that I am a convicted sex offender.'' Honest, brave, funny, lust, awkward, the story adds up in a variety of things except there is no true spice like really spicy. Because its want to tickle you than taking up everything seriously. That's why the movie clicked very well, even though the story leaps were very tight because of the many layers to cover. All the five tales ends in (around) three random displays of the acts. The first one for the intro, then where the problem arises and ends with the solutions and twists. I would love to have part 2, not the follow up because I want new sex related words from its dictionary with freshened pairs. The 'phone sex' part was everyone's favourite. Its the talk of the movie related blog, reviews, database, IRC and apps, and I as well loved it. That does not mean other characters and stories are weaker than this one. The 'rape', 'role play' and others are all so good too. Different viewers enjoy different type, that is according to close to their sex fantasies from one of these, I believe. So are you ready for 'the little death'?. 9/10"
1021,ted-2-movie,TheApplegnome,7,"You're probably thinking; ""well is it better than the first?"" No it's not, but it's a fine continuation of the crazy franchise. I can say this; I had a great time with this movie, and there are some hilarious moments that totally made me laugh out loud. Sure there could have been more of that and the trailers spoiled way too much, but I had a great time with it. The plot is a bit vague though, and the whole movie could have gained so much if it was even more less-serious, just as it should be. Credit really goes to Seth MacFarlane and the big star cameos. It's a classic MacFarlane movie and it might not surpass the predecessor due to lack of storytelling and long-term excitement, but it stands out on its own as a great, crazy comedy. 7/10"
1022,nine-lives-2016-movie,fearti2,1,"I had wanted to watch this movie with, besides I love cats too much and there are Kevin Spacey and Christopher Walken so I decided to watch it. But I was not yet awared that it was one of the worst decision I made by then. Don't think the whole movie will be as funny as the funny cat videos that are shown in the beginning of the movie. Probably, those videos will be the only things that you laugh at in the whole movie. The ultimate question about the movie that needs to be asked is: ""What are Spacey and Walken aiming to do by taking part in this film?"""
1023,madagascar-escape-2-africa-movie,Jollyjoe1000,3,"evan though it gets more indebted with the characters and origins and the beginning is good,the rest of the movie (except the  ending that was the only other good part) fell flat.Like a pancake."

1030,black-swan-movie,Dalem,7,"{Spoiler alert]    Very good movie in many respects.  The acting is good and, from a quite formal point of view, the film is well-structured.  One of the interesting things about the film is the many thematic references.  It references Freud in dealing with repression and the relation between a woman and her mother.  Jung is referenced in the story of how a person must come to terms with his or her ""shadow"" which is often referred to as a doppleganger.  Even French Symbolist poetry with its fondness for the swan, which in French is the ""signe""--the sign or symbol, comes into play.   If you are a person who really likes things intellectual like this, you will probably get a lot out of this film.    However, on an emotional level, the film never takes flight.  We really never connect to the character.  There is very little emotional variety in this film.  It's the same emotion throughout with just an increasing intensity.  It may be a ""tour de force"" but after a while it kind of gets monotonous.   When I saw the film, audience members laughed at a scene of a dead body being dragged.  (A ballerina dragging a dead body is funny!)  I have heard of other viewings with hoots and hollers at the sex scenes.  I think people just get bummed out at such ""very serious theater"" sort of business.  At the end of the film, the main character dies.  I have yet to hear of anyone shedding a tear for her."
1031,captain-america-the-winter-soldier-movie,tremault,8,"I really hated the first Capta film, I felt is was more Capta in Limbo than Capta in America.well to be honest it sent me to sleep. the story of some puppet idiot who wants to go off and take orders from a corrupt imperialist government, OK the USA were the heroes in WW2 but I generally get the stink of false heroism when I hear about the USA today so didn't really like the story about the super soldier. the first film sent me to sleep, SO I had no interest in this film initially, until my friend convinced me to watch it. I was quite surprised as right from the start the film was suggesting Capta's disagreement with the way the USA was going. He seemed to be at odds with what America has become and so I really started to take an interest. As the film continued I was really impressed at the themes they were exploring and grew to really like Capta and his stance. I started to understand that Capta embodies the true American spirit ; the idea of America that I admired from an early age. The character were quite interesting and although some of them were pretty predictable, there were a couple of times in this film where I was truly surprised. The movement of Capta and the other characters was really impressive, nothing at all like a Michael Bay film where you can't follow the action at all. this was all very clean movement and was very well choreographed. the action sequences were quite exciting and not dumbed down IMO. All in all, this movie turned me into a fan of Capta and now I want to read his comic book about the 'Civil War'."
1032,the-florida-project-movie,netflic,8,"This is an excellent movie by young and talented director Sean Baker.I loved his previous movie Tangerine. Similarly to Tangerine, this movie is about people who live in the underbelly of our society. Gruesome realism sprinkled with dark humor and occasional sympathy.Two of the film's protagonists, a 6-year-old Mooney and her good-for-nothing single mom Halley live in a seedy motel not far from Disneyworld, Florida.Being extremely curious and mischievous, Mooney and her friends run around and create chaos for both management and occupants. Utterly unfit parents love their kids but spoil them in so many ways. It is difficult to make a movie where kids behave naturally. Not a problem for Sean Baker.Young actress Brooklynn Prince who plays Mooney definitely deserves Oscar.I should also mention excellent casting and very impressive visuals. "
1033,where-in-the-world-is-osama-bin-laden-movie,PriscillaD.,0," A disaster of the worst kind. Lazy storytelling. Pedantic narrative. Good intentions but the pedestrian course of this movie, along with a noncoherent and fratboy mentality, make this movie tank."
1034,guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie,alejandro970,9,"An epic experience out of this galaxy with disfunctional but funny, clever heroes. The FX does not hamper the plot and the OST is memorable. One of Marvel bigger hits. Good choice with a bucket of popcorn."
1035,mamma-mia!-here-we-go-again-movie,Ratercrictic,0,"The  movie I felt was disappointing with a bad plot ruining a movie that could have had potential fails the expectations focusing on the music to make you think it was good, to experience how much the movie offers buy the soundtrack."
1036,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Quizzacious,7,"Rian Johnson successfully created a thrilling and suspense cinematic experience that are rare for huge franchise like this. The movie is filled with beautiful cinematic shots that are satisfying to watch in the theaters.However, Star Wars 8 failed to tell a complete story. With some scene completely unnecessary, it destroyed the suspense that was built up, such as the Casino scene. The entire plot of Star Wars 8 alone is pretty shallow as they are trying to reveal everything in Star Wars 9, which is the last of the trilogy. However, this not only created a boring Star Wars 8 plot-wise, but will also cause Star Wars 9 to be too rushed to reveal everything. Not to mention that Kylo Ren is the weakest, least threatening villain of all Star Wars movies. Because of this, the movie lack of tension during the fight scene of Kylo Ren. Overall, it is an enjoyable movie, but definitely not as good as critics claimed."
1037,jupiter-ascending-movie,reijiro,3,"All I can say is, after I watched the movie, I felt bad at all the money they must have spent in making this.  With all that money, they could have made a fantastic movie that could have been epic. Oh well.  One of those movies I'd probably forget.  So I'm writing a review to remind myself not to watch this again in the future."
1038,inglourious-basterds-movie,ChrisL,0," The guy sitting next to me walked out. I should have followed him. The trailers make this movie seem like it's about Brad Pitt and his gang, killing Nazis in all kinds of entertaining ways. Instead you get people sitting around, talking, drinking, and smoking in German and French for 95% of the movie. Normally, Tarantino's strength is his dialogue and acting, but when almost all of it is in a different language, it's just tedious. The plot is absurd, the scenes are uninteresting, the dialogue is pointless, the cinematography is ok. This movie was so bad, I started rooting for the Nazis."

Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Larry Flynt is so realistic and Courtney Love's portrayal of his wife is truly mesmerizing. What can't this woman do?

1042,ghost-in-the-shell-2017-movie,veganox,0,"All style and no substance. Dumbed down from the original to accommodate the masses. Random slathering of scenes taken from the original with none of the plot importance attached. It is a visually stunning movie. It's plot is better than Dragonball: Evolution. But I'd rather gouge my eyes out than watch that abortion of a movie, so that's not really praiseworthy."
1043,villa-capri-movie,GreatMartin,1,"Starring Morgan Freeman, Tommy Lee Jones with Rene Russo, Jane Seymour, Elizabeth Ashley and an appearance by Johnny Mathis with a script by and directed by Ron Shelton of “Bull Durham”, “Tin Cup” and “White Men Can’t Jump” how can a movie be this bad? The fact that it wasn’t pre-screened for critics, opening cold Friday was sort of a hint that it wasn’t good and it isn’t. There is about one minute with a limbo contest between Freeman and Jones that may give you a hint of a smile but that is it! Freeman fares the best but that is strictly due to his persona.I seldom, if ever, negative about performers looks but I have to make a few general comments here. Both Freeman and Jones are aging fine up to this point but of the women I wish Elizabeth Ashley hadn’t appeared on the screen as I once thought this woman was beautiful but, to me, that’s not true anymore. I didn’t, gratefully, recognize Jane Seymour during the movie and had to check the credits out to see what part she played.I am not just picking on the women as I am still shaking my head over my ‘idol’, for many reasons, Johnny Mathis! We are both the same age but he looks 20 years older than he should plus the two songs he sang didn’t sound like the Mathis I know.Sometimes a movie is so bad it becomes a cult film but this is so bad it should just disappear and never be shown again!"

1045,paranormal-activity-movie,ZaraC,2," I thought this was a laughably bad movie.

None of it is scary, nor tense, just irritating."
1046,rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-movie,SchroederRock,9,"After a ho-hum Episode 7 that rehashes the plot of Episode 4, I wasn't sure I had much faith left in Disney's ability to resurrect this franchise and push it forward. Rogue One has completely changed my mind on that. One can make a case that the first 30 minutes of the movie are a bit forgettable but ultimately they create the groundwork for the rest of the film, which connects phenomenally with Episode 4's first moments. Where Rogue One succeeds over Episode 7 is the visceral feel of the film. This is absolutely a space epic with futuristic technology and tons of gloss but somehow it all comes off with a little grit and loads more adventure than last year's Episode 7. Rogue One shows that there are stories worth telling in between the major events seen in each Episode film. Even if you're not an avid Star Wars fan, you can appreciate what Rogue One is, but tuned-in fans will love seeing several familiar faces of the early Rebellion. Whatever the next Star Wars film is, bring it one!"
1047,stardust-movie,PeterJ.,8, Good solid family entertainment.
1048,jiro-dreams-of-sushi-movie,Jwv,8,"A great feel-good documentary. The film succeeds in bringing forward an inspiring story of success. It's a good thing the film also focuses on Jiro's succession, but some deeper personal digging into the mystery Jiro still is after watching instead of focusing almost solely on his weighty philosophy, could justify the title some more. I had the feeling that the director didn't really have a very cohesive and logic narrative in mind throughout the whole mid part of the film, and that the reorganization of some scenes could have provided a more intricate and seamless narrative structure. What I thought was particularly great about seeing this movie from a European perspective was that it made me genuinely inquisitive and interested into this unknown Japanese culture. A film with a real, albeit cliché message."
1049,the-babadook-movie,wesleyoldaker,10,"There are the horror movies that acheive greatness by scaring you by what's on screen, jolting your conscious mind, and there are the ones that do it by sinking into your unconscious mind like a splinter, lingering and haunting you well after the show is over.  This is one of the latter, and a truly great example of it.  I've seen it a few times now and it gets better with each viewing."
1050,turbo-movie,Spikerr,2,"DreamWorks Animation’s Turbo tells the story of Theo, a garden snail with large ambitions. His role model, Guy Gagne, inspires him to become a racer, even though he is ridiculed for his unrealistic dreams. After a freak accident involving Nitrous Oxide, Theo’s DNA and life will never be the same. After meeting several friends along the way, he and his human friend Tito start on a journey to win the Indianapolis 500, despite the arguments put up by their down-to-Earth brothers. Turbo is one of the more disappointing animated movies of 2013, even more so after considering that DreamWorks produced this for $127 million. Upon first glance, Turbo appears to be a sort of Ratatouille and Cars hybrid. After watching the movie, it comes true, as it features the same themes as the former and the environment of the latter. DreamWorks effectively creates parallels between the two pairs of brothers – Theo and Chet; Tito and Angelo. However, it doesn’t do much else with them and the brotherly bond subplot, among many others, is lost in the wind due to its underdevelopment. Part of the reason for this is that the cast is made up of far too many characters. It gets to the point that the majority of the characters play too minor a part to justify development or a connection with the audience. Children might find joy and excitement in watching Turbo, thanks to its flashy visuals – highlighted by a minor race sequence and Turbo’s neon-blue trail. Its auto-tuned song, “The Snail is Fast”, might have children singing it upon leaving the theatre, but may only serve to annoy the rest of us. Turbo attempts to introduce humour a few times with the eagles, tomatoes, and snail crew, but unfortunately falls short every time. A running gag, the crows snatching up the snails, hopefully will zip past childrens’ minds, as that won’t be a particularly enjoyable conversation to have with a young one. One thing that parents may notice is the extremely blatent product placement. Brands on cars is perfectly understandable (although avoidable), but I’m sure DreamWorks could have made the same movie without a Verizon-branded phone or HP-branded laptops – no offense to either company. A few plot-holes are present in the movie, namely the over-dramatized “permission to race” sequence – Tito earlier mentions that snails can race in the Indy 500. So why make such a big deal out of it? DreamWorks also feels the need to run an extremely minor and useless romance subplot in the background of the entire movie – for no reason except to maybe entertain younger audiences. DreamWorks had a juicy premise with Turbo, but instead of fleshing out the characters and plot, fails to deliver anything substantial, instead giving quite a rotten movie."
1051,grown-ups-movie,AJackson729,2,"An extremely unfunny movie that does a terrible job of trying to give moral advice on growing up. The movie is basically devoid of any plot from what I could tell.

1052,blood-diamond-movie,AMovieCritic,8," A good old adventure movie with a strong plot and interesting characters. Plus, great setting and really cool music. Really good acting, as well. A pretty eye-opening movie. Runs a little long and can be a bit preachy at times but it's a really well-filmed and very fun movie with some amazing action scenes. Recommended."
1053,blade-runner-2049-movie,PotaeSuprakit,8,"Blade Runner 2049 returns very few of the characters from the original film but they manage to breathe life into this movie through the new ones they created. Officer K isn't the most lively protagonist but he gets an eye-opening character arc that kept me involved. Deckard doesn't appear till later in the movie but he remains interesting and what they decide to do with him makes his appearance worthwhile. I also really liked some of the smaller supporting characters. Sapper really helps kick off the movie, what Joi represents is extremely emotional and Mariette is so mysterious that her involvement brings up more and more questions. Add in that Niander Wallace and Luv make for pretty menacing villains and you have a pretty well-rounded and fascinating script.I don't think that the actors/actresses will be the focal point of the awards attention that this movie will get but that doesn't mean there aren't exemplary performances. Gosling is good as K, he's deliberately robotic and he accomplishes a lot through his subtlety. Harrison Ford isn't in the movie as much as I wanted him to be (he's still one of my all-time favourite actors) but he holds up his end. He works with Gosling well and they have a solid rapport. Surprisingly, I really liked Sylvia Hoeks. She stole a lot of her scenes and I thought she was great even acting against a stacked cast. Dave Bautista showed he has a lot more range than people give him credit for. Jared Leto is in a very Jared Leto role (deliberately weird and hard to understand) but he does it well and although he might be a little creepy, the guy is still a great actor. I also want to credit Ana de Armas, she was distinctly warm and she showed a lot more emotion than I had seen from her previously."
1054,sing-street-movie,Eilidh2,3,"If you've ever seen the excellent movie ""The Commitments"" you don't really need to see this one. It's like an awkward tween version of that far better film. Might be suitable for middle schoolers who loved Glee, but otherwise?"
1055,the-dark-knight-movie,Squilliam,0,"Overrated as Hell! I do not understand why people say this piece of trash is so good. Especially when they say ""It's a classic- right up there with The Godfather."" Uhhhhh...... NO! Some poor performances (cough, cough, Bale), an over complicated plot (just like all Nolan movies), cheesy lines, and some pretty awful action scenes all contribute to making this movie one awful pile of crap."
1056,exodus-gods-and-kings-movie,BrotherDom,0,"Exodus is a failed remake of the movie classic The Ten Commandments and seriously downplays God and faith. What is unexpected however is how miserably the movie fails to deliver on its secular assets. The story line was weak and confusing, character development nonexistent; the acting was lackluster, and nothing memorable about the dialogue. As for special effects, the movie opens with very impressive scenes of ancient Egypt in all its glory. When it comes to the two visual milestones, the burning bush and the crossing of the Red Sea, Cecil B. DeMille is still the hands down winner 58 years later. A big budget and computer graphics are not enough. This movie suffers from a lack of message, emotion, and entertainment. It assumes you know the story of Moses, but then departs so far from the Biblical narrative to leave you frustrated and dissatisfied. If you are not familiar with the story, the gaps are so plentiful that all you are left with is a war movie and a chase scene, both of which are poorly done. For example, as Pharaoh chases Moses he loses his entire army in a landslide. A few minutes later, he is leading a division of chariots across the Red Sea! If you are hoping this movie will bring a Christian message to a younger generation, this movie fails miserably. Unfortunately, it also fails to entertain the secular audience. The movie is fittingly named Exodus, which is what moviegoers should do."
1057,august-rush-movie,hyperstranger,8,I agree with other comments here in that this film must not be taken too seriously - it's a charming well presented fairytale which kept me more than entertained for it's duration.
1058,the-fantastic-four-movie,NatT96,2,"Seriously you will need to see Ant Man to wash this films terrible taste out of your mouth, it just did nothing correct at all and felt incomplete. I must say this film is worst than the first 2 original film, but at the same time while I didn't like the first 2 films, the first 2 films had better developed characters than this one. You just cannot connect to these characters at all, they just have no souls. The CGI is the only thing that is acceptable, everything else is crap, to the slim plot and to the bad development on the characters. I more so feel sorry for the actors though, all very young and wanting to be actors, ave there images put into a crappy spotlight. They even deserved better."
1059,jack-goes-boating-movie,hgquinn,10,"No glamour here. Just unparalleled acting from Hoffman, Amy Ryan, John Ortiz and Daphne Rubin-Vega and the rest of the cast. A strong, tender movie.

The final part where the three main characters and Nebbecracker are persecuted by Constance / house spent a little overboard but overall the movie is quite appealing ."

1062,transformers-age-of-extinction-movie,SimpleReviewz,2,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is Michael Bay's 4th movie in the series, and at first glance it seems like this sequel is a departure from the previous 3 movies in the franchise. Brand new actors, Transformers, stories, and so on are all packed in here. Does it sound like this movie will be a change to the series, and maybe even for the better? The true answer is this: TF4 is the same movie as the previous ones, and that's not good. Michael Bay tried to make us care about the characters in this movie, especially the main family that includes Mark Wahlberg as the one and only father, Nicola Peltz as his daughter, and Jack Reynor as the daughter's boyfriend. At first, I started giving a slight amount of care towards them. However, as the movie progressed, the dialogue with them just became completely stupid, and I didn't care about them in the end. Speaking of dialogue, it is awful. Michael Bay still puts his terrible humor and one-liners in there. In terms of story, it becomes so similar to the past films, which also means it becomes jumbled and clunky. In my eyes, most people come to see the Transformers movies to see non-stop action and explosions and amazing visual effects. I will admit that the visual effects set a new bar for the franchise. The action at its core, though? It's exactly what you would expect out of a Michael Bay film. The first few scenes of the action entertained me. Then, it just went on and on and on, and it got so tiring. As a very young child, I loved dinosaurs. TF4 has something awesome: DINOBOTS. Yeah, no. They are only in there for a few action scenes, and they brought nothing new to the table. Great. The only thing good in this movie, as I said before, were the special and visual effects. However, even that should be expected out of this franchise and this day and age. Everything else wasn't good at all, and I walked out knowing that every other movie that would come out of this franchise here on out would be the same."
1063,shoot-em-up-movie,AdamH,10," I loved this movie. If Die Hard or a Bond movie is magic, then this is a Bond movie directed by Penn & Teller. It's not serious and there in lies the beauty."

Focus really hard on the last line of the movie and you'll realize that what you thought was the twist was not it at all. If you think that what the doctor describes at the end is true then you have a very low movie I.Q. and are not deserving of the greatness that Scorcese created here."

1066,downfall-movie,AndyH.,10," Film-making doesn't get much better than this. The decision to portray the main protagonists as ordinary human beings makes the crimes perpetrated by the Third Reich even more horrific and incomprehensible than would have been the case if they had been portrayed as two dimensional monsters. The feeling of claustrophobia and impending disaster in Hitler's bunker is palpable, and the scene in which the Goebbels children are murdered by their mother is truly one of the most appallingly horrific and uncomfortable sequences you are ever likely to see, but it is used to underline just how much the Nazi philosophy had perverted the mindset of diehard fanatics, to such an extent that they were willing to kill their own children rather than have them live in a world without National Socialism. A classic of modern cinema."

1068,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,cephalo,3,"Star Wars movies always involve hundreds of creative people who churn out masterpieces for the little details. Often though, the guy at the top can't match their enthusiasm and skill. This movie really epitomizes that. Some of the things I liked about the previous movie were some of the questions it raised, so I was very disappointed to see those questions all thrown out in the sequel.I get the feeling that the main outline for the plot was thrown together in a weekend, with no serious consideration of what had come before or what might come after. I feel I learned nothing about the past and wasn't given any reason to care about the future.In politics or movies or anything else, don't step up for leadership if you don't have a vision. The director let his team down."

1070,hes-just-not-that-into-you-movie,SylviaV,7," Went to see this movie expecting some lighthearted fun and a few amusing observations on romantic relationships- and that's exactly what I got. It's a fun, bubbly piece that makes raises a few good questions about dating and relationships in the 21st century, though I think some parts were quite superfluous, like the Sex&amp;the City inspired supposedly-witty monologues from random people on the street. The characters themselves, however, are mostly well portrayed, and as there are so many, the average viewer is certain to identify with at least one of them. Gigi's clinginess manages to come off as endearing rather than irritating and her antics arouse both amusement and empathy which, in my opinion, makes her the most original and loveable character in the film. All in all, an entertaining piece in which everybody can find at least a part of their own (romantic) personality!"
1071,pans-labyrinth-movie,JonM,10,"A great fantasy adventure that despite some incredulous remarks and 0 scores still rates at 8.4. This says much for the maligned few who judge not on message but on appearance, choosing to bypass the part of the brain that processes thought and sends them straight out of the rear. To avoid this film because of such pretentious folks thinking they are above the underlying meaning of the film is nigh on criminal."
1072,the-hunger-games-mockingjay---part-1-movie,Bshop,3,"Disappointing. They should have had a long movie (only one) to finish the series.I read the book again after the second movie (wanted to find out everything about the ending!) and I must say, it was a quick read. Didn't even pay attention to the fact it was separated in 2 parts in the book, who knew?Anyway, this movie felt drawn out - probably because it was. There just wasn't enough material in the book to cover a 2 hour movie.  The one saving grace was Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) - what little scene he had, was great, gritty, and raw (won't spoil it for you!)In summary, skip the theater and wait for rental (preferably just before the last movie comes out). This was a cash grab by the studio, producers, and everyone involved. I would honestly skip the theater if I could go back in time."
1073,skyfall-movie,napstrpsx,1,"First of all, whoever is simply upvoting positive reviews and downvoting negative ones, you are not helping constructive film criticism. This movie is bad, and there are reasons for that: 1) Bond never gives us a reason to like him as a person, yet we're expected to cheer for him. He's smug and dull. (half of the jokes in the movie didn't get any reaction whatsoever from the theatre I was in) Despite the long run time there is little to no interpersonal character development.2) The movie is paced poorly, almost unbearably slow at times. Even long-time Bond fans I was with admitted that they couldn't understand why some scenes went on for as long as they did or why they were even in the film at all.3) I'm sorry, but the Bond 'death' scenes are too ridiculous! I couldn't get over it and it's why I have to mark this review as having spoilers to include this point. If you get shot w/ a sniper rifle in the chest and plummet lifelessly underwater, you won't live! How can we take the movie seriously after that? And then you have Bond wrestling w/ a guy in icy water and is completely nonchalant underwater after killing him. Does Bond have superhuman traits that would make any comic book character jealous? The only redeeming things I can think of this movie are a decent opening and Kincade, the old guy at Skyfall. He is the ONLY character in this movie with any heart that I cared about and enjoyed watching. He alone earns the one point I would be willing to award to this film. Good riddance to the featured M."
1074,iron-man-3-movie,PulpFiction25,7,"Iron Man 3, the first movie I ever walked out of a theater after seeing and didn't know whether i liked it or not. But after looking through the plot and recalling certain scenes, I realized that this movie was a solid film, not amazing, not horrible, but solid. My one major complaint about it was that Director Shane Black tried to make it too funny. its an action movie with comedy, not an action comedy movie. half of the good comedy was some of Starks clever remarks towards the young boy and Mandarin, and the other half was the great satire dealing with how America views terrorism. The action sequences were great! Especially his house being destroyed. I enjoyed the major plot twist of this movie. It was certainly something no one expected to happen, and whether you were excited or pissed about it, you were indeed shocked by it. Despite Robert Downey's great performance as Iron Man again, I must say that Guy Pearce delivered the best performance in this movie. He was sinister, seductive, hate able yet believable. I truly think this summer will be the summer of great super villains. With actors like Pearce, Michael Shannon, and Benedict Cumberbatch playing villains who can easily steal the praise of the movie from the hero themselves. Overall I liked this movie, everyone should see it at least once, Ill see it again just not in theaters. I appreciate how it brought closure to Iron Man, but I wonder how he will be used in the next Avengers movies. Plus he will probably have more of those weird anxiety attacks. And Mandarin's army reminded me too much of the robot villain from Terminator 2, I guess they were supposed to be that way."
1075,speed-racer-movie,JavierF.,0," Bad film. Bored. Bad history. Xtremely confused action. too much colors to enjoy the action. is a pity that the original comic was destroyed for Wach brothers..... I spect some better from they. I hate you, wachosky brothers!"
1076,the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-movie,eagleeyeviking,8,The first installment of the Hobbit franchise spends a lot of time laying its foundations then uses it to create an immersive experience for its audience.
1077,syriana-movie,dave,10," This movie was great. However, if you are an idiot and can't follow four separate parts to one story (that all come together) then don't bother. So, go see the movie. But be warned: it's not action packed, yoiu may have to think instead of absorbing special effects, and you may have to use reasoning skills at something like a fifth grade level. Unfortunately as I've seen several comments below, these traits are now few and far between."
1078,star-wars-episode-vi---return-of-the-jedi-movie,GrantD243,8,"Being the final film in the original trilogy, it's a bit surprising that Return of the Jedi is my least favorite of the three. It's still a fine film and plenty of fun to watch, but the plot is the weakest of the trilogy (besides the ending), and those damn Ewoks get on my nerves a bit. The ending was very fitting and provided a nice close to the story, though. In terms of the sci-fi genre, Return of the Jedi is an all-timer, but with its two predecessors in the series being classic level movies, it's hard not to think of it as the inferior one."
1079,a-good-year-movie,JonathanH,0, I saw this movie in Barcelona. The sound dropped out for ten minutes and while the audience waited ten minutes for the projectionist to notice I provided a monotone simultaneous translation of the Spanish subtitles into English. Definitely the highlight of the evening for those who had wasted money on this pathetic trash. Sometimes i wonder if making movies like this is part of some kind of tax evasion scheme.
1080,memento-movie,jmydizon,8,"This is one of Nolan's best films in his career. A film that keeps you thinking about who did what or what happened that caused this. The fact that this film is not in chronological order makes it worth its genre of being a mystery. Although some of the scenes are worth looking over to actually understand the movie much better. The story to this movie is superb though, just a lack of understanding the movie is its downfall. Otherwise great film, good acting, and terrific writing. A movie to see before you die."
1081,a-history-of-violence-movie,CherS,0," Pop some corn at home and skip the lines. Silly movie, and some things just don't add up. No crowd at this movie, the word must be out."
1082,inception-movie,PatrickS.,10," I was afraid that the commercial success of the ""Dark Night"" C. Nolan will fall (like other promising directors) into the blockbuster with lots of stars with big budget with a useless story, just to make the Studio happy to gross money on his fame alone. None of that. I believe he has delivered one of the best movie in the last ten years. I can understand some critics that say he could have gone further into the ""delirium"" of the story; or others who believe he went too far to be watchable. But if you keep an open mind, appreciate the actors play (All the cast is really good), and give credit to Nolan's details of the script, you will enjoy that movie a lot."

1084,where-the-wild-things-are-movie,theDUDE,0, In a nutshell strange movie. I was wondering what the plot to this movie was going to be and about a quarter way through the move I didn't really care. I have no idea why so called movie critics rated this movie so high. maybe they have an interest in the movie such as stock holdings. probubly the worst movie of the year. two thumbs down sucked really bad.
1085,the-happening-movie,Jefframone,2," An oh man, how many crappy movies does M. Night Shyamalan before I stop seeing his stuff? The mysterious premise sucked me. And honestly, the first like 15 minutes of the film was scary, weird, exciting, effective and roped me in immediately. And then Marky Mark opened his mouth. Let me save you the time, trouble and $10: some really angry plants are responsible for the events of The Happening. There was an opportunity to do something interesting, but instead Shyamalan wrote the point of the whole movie on a large polo mallet and continuously whacked moviegoers over the head again and again and again. The point: Mother Earth is pissed at us. Plants and trees are adapting to these foreign invaders (humans) and spreading a toxic across the Northeast presumably to purge the planet of humankind. The End. Yet another Hollywood missed opportunity. Shame on me for getting suckered into one of his films -- AGAIN!"
1086,finding-dory-movie,ReviewsByChris,8,"Finding Dory is set 1 year after the events of Finding Nemo, and our familiar fish faces Nemo (Hayden Rolence), father Marlin (Albert Brooks), and Dory (Ellen DeGeneres)- the blue tang with short-term memory loss- have settled into normal life at the reef. Dory's memory is infuriating everyone, including herself- and she's struggling to find a role in sea life. But one day, she regains some memories of her family and is determined to find them. But she knows she can't do it alone. Accompanied by Nemo and-reluctantly- Marlin, she must once again make her way across the ocean navigated only by sporadic memories of her childhood to find her parents. But it won't be easy. Along the way she encounters old friends, new creatures, and no shortage of obstacles between her and being reunited with her family. But is this journey futile, or just too impossible? 13 years. 13 years we have been waiting for this movie. And may I just applaud Pixar on such a smart way of making money. Now you've got all the people who were kids when they saw Nemo, all the parents who saw it with them, all the current kids who can see this one, and all the current parents, plus all the others who are just interested in the movie. That's a lot more of an audience than you would normally get for the average children's film. Pixar have released amazing films that are fantastic in giving you the feels and providing quality animated movies. They have received an impressive 30 nominations and 11 wins at the Academy Awards, but they haven't faired so well in two out of three sequels they've made. This combination of reputations gave me both excitement and weariness going into this movie. The trailers didn't look so good as well. The verdict?...SUCCESS!! Thank God! Pixar is back on track! This film was the definition of 'a rollercoaster of emotions'. Fear, sadness, desperation, admiration, happiness, laughter, ecstasy, hysteria, and tears (of both happiness and sadness) could be seen by the people sitting next to me in the theatre. That is what I believe composes a quality film. The plot was well-designed and crafted- even if in their journey they go around in circles a little bit- and wastes no time getting underway in the beginning. There is a bit of back and forth between flashbacks and reality, which got annoying after a while, and those emotions I was talking about before were not sustained consistently throughout the movie. They existed in small pockets, especially so nearer to the climax(es) of this movie. This could easily be a source of boredom. And then there's Dory herself. You either love her or hate her. When the movie started, Dory was doing her whole 'sorry, I forgot' routine every 5 seconds and I groaned thinking; 'is this really going to be the whole movie?' but luckily it's not, but it's definitely there. Just enough so that you accept that its a character trait, not an annoyance. And one last thing about plot conveniences, HOW DOES NOBODY SEE THIS OCTOPUS CLEARLY MOVING INFRONT OF YOU??? (more of him in a second...) The cast has a lot of familiar faces- especially if you've seen Modern Family- including old faces Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Hayden Rolence, Andrew Stanton and Bob Peterson among others meeting new faces Ed O'Neil, Ty Burrell, Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy, Sloane Murray, Idris Elba, and Dominic West. All the voicing was excellent, with DeGeneres demonstrating more of an emotional range. We got to see some solid character development from all our characters, but I would've liked to see some more depth from Hank the octopus- who was one of my favourite new additions- as cruel as he is stealthy- able to hide in plain sight and pull off some daring escapes without being seen due to his dexterity and ability to camouflage, however, I loved all the new additions!! Themes include family, belonging, uniqueness, friendship, and loyalty. As usual, there's plenty of morals here for the kids to live by. The animation was up to its great standard, and the cinematography was fantastic, along with Stanton and McLane's directing. In terms of engagement, my attention was lost sometimes, but most of the time, I was thoroughly engaged by the storyline, characters, blending of genres and spectacular animation. The ending, however, I felt was a little too long. Poignant, but tedious. No cliches here either, another unique Pixar film. The tone was simultaneously emotional yet lighthearted due to the way the proceedings occur. I expect some Oscar nominations from this movie. You should probably watch Finding Nemo to get some context of the characters, but it isn't a necessity. They make some references to the original which is good for nostalgic purposes. To improve, sustain the emotive scenes and engaging qualities over the entire film for better engagement, and the running time probably could've been cut down."
1087,silent-hill-movie,UlrichD.,10,"Slow-paces, non-scaring, but very disturbing and beautiful... the best video game movie ever."
1088,the-devil-wears-prada-movie,CameronJ.,1," This movie failed to transcend to people uninterested in fashion, and failed to satisfy the eye-candy requirements of someone interested in fashion. The movie was a bad fashion movie, rather than a good movie that happens to take place in the fashion industry. The movie relied on brandnames to interest me for the whole length of the movie. Needless to say, it didn't work."
1089,the-master-movie,MarkAngel,10,"Superbly crafted, The Master is the ultimate contemporary Avant-garde film. The complexity of the story and the lack of dramatic coherence and unity, combined with richly colored cinematography, Greenwood's brilliant score and  Anderson's nearly unprecedented artistic talent rich in philosophically adventurous and thematically exploitative spirit, makes The Master a layered statement against conventional narrative and determined resolution. Therefore, it  sustains its marvelous and enigmatic opacity and many may find it very difficult to deal with it. Nonetheless, even those who find it difficult to digest Anderson's lack of transparency and non-eventful story, should be able to find a lot to enjoy in, e.g. the masterclass performances. Besides the grand aesthetic values, the film also explores themes such as post-war American society, its psychological, emotional and moral structure, the western's world principles of freedom and the conflicting yet absorbing authority of the master, the loss, weirdness, sadness, mental illness, belief, accompanied with suggestive philosophical ideas such as the impossibility of reconstructing and ultimately, facing one' s past."
1090,all-eyez-on-me-movie,LinttaFlamingo,1,"The music's good, but this movie can take a long walk off a short dck.This film gets it immediately wrong. It starts with Tupac being interviewed in jail and it's done in a documentary kind of way with flashbacks and all, and it doesn't work. It feels so unnatural. The film basically jumps to different times constantly, and I had no idea when was when and what was happening. The first 90 minutes almost feel like going between four to five different scenes over and over again. It lacks creativity and every scene feels exactly the same with characters just delivering terrible expository dialogue. It's boring, annoying, all the dialogue sounds the exact same and the random jumping between different times and characters literally gives me no chance to even try to care about anyone else than Tupac. Sure, it's a film about Tupac but this back and forth running between random terribly acted characters gives me a fcking migraine.The film feels cheaply and negligently made. The colors are ugly, the directing is bland, the editing is ass and so many scenes are just done in the exact same spot that it feels like they just couldn't afford or bother to shoot somewhere else. So many times I was watching a scene and just thinking if anyone seriously even bothered with this wank. Tupac's audition scene to Digital Underground was probably the most slapdash made ""scene"" of the whole film. Also Snoop Dogg's portrayal was very forced in. He had little to no screen time which all of was very pointless, and his dubbing was so unnecessary and low effort. I think the guy can talk himself too.But the weirdest thing about the film is that in a movie about a musician there are barely any music scenes. Seriously, this bollocks has only like two or three of those. The ones that are there are ok. The music is of course good and the scenes have some nice camera movement between stage and the crowd and Demetrius Shipp Jr. is very believable, but why on earth are there so few of them? Was the movie so goddamn busy to get back to the terrible exposition tosh? In this 2 hour and 20 minute movie. I do not fcking know but this is bollocks.The film does succeed though in making Tupac seem like someone who simply wanted his message out to the world in his music and it's respectable. That's all!"
1091,sicario-movie,MrMovieBuff,9,"'Sicario' may not be the most entertaining film for the average moviegoer, nor is it for the faint of heart. But this is skillfully directed by Denis Villeneuve and the acting, mostly from Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and certainly Benicio Del Toro are absolutely superb. This truly felt like a director's movie, given that we are living in a day and age where a movie feels like it belongs to the studio. The cinematography is also great, and the movie knows how to add suspense without treating its audience like idiots. With a plot that focuses on an FBI agent (Emily Blunt) that is enlisted by the government to track down the leader of a Mexican drug cartel, you know you are in for over 2 hours of brilliant suspense and atmosphere. It may not be the blockbuster type movie, nor is it the kind of movie that you may watch over and over again, but it's a movie that has quality."
1092,crash-movie,TrevorC.,10," Simply one of the best films ever made. This has joined my top-five favorite films. It's deep, emotional, touching and true. It hits home in every aspect and addresses a current problem with our society."
1093,despicable-me-2-movie,Steamcausedthis,8,"Never watched the first movie until the morning before going to watch this sequel, gotta say my diabetes count that day was off the chart. This was a great family film and was very enjoyable even for a grown man myself, easily one of the better films this year."
1094,the-incredible-hulk-movie,LinttaFlamingo,3,"This movie is pretty bad. I liked Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, but it takes like 30 minutes for him to start doing any kind of hulking. And when he's not hulking, which he mostly isn't, the movie is either uninteresting exposition or a romance between Bruce and Arwen from The Lord of the Rings, who by the way sounds like she's having breathing problems every time she talks. The special effects also aren't that great and I had a hard time caring about any of the characters in the end. There are some fun dialogue scenes, but they are seriously lacking and definitely aren't enough to make me care to watch this thing again."
1095,inglourious-basterds-movie,JaredZ,1," After releasing three masterworks--the KILL BILL series and the wonderful GRINDHOUSE, Tarantino's latest is one of his greatest disappointments...easily one of his worst. A monotonous, dreary epic, where excessive use of subtitles are used as a substitute for his usually fascinating dialogue. Brad Pitt's laughable excuse of a southern accent could just as easily have been derived from watching a few episodes of ""My Name is Earl"". Devoid of style and an intriguing plot, this is a stiff."
1096,10000-bc-movie,BrandonC.,1," I would advise that you wait for this movie to come out on DVD, so you can skip it again. This movie has literally nothing going for it. The acting is poor. the plot is full of holes bigger than George Bush's presidency. Though the CG effects are good, all the action sequences are spoiled by terrible dialouge and screenplay. If this movie was a comedy, it would be great, but because it takes itself so seriously, it goes from laughably bad to annoying. You'll laugh, you'll cry. and you can kiss your money goodbye!"

1098,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,slavetothewage,1,"The Last Jedi is nothing more than badly written fan fiction with a massive budget. Only worth watching so you can make your oiwn mind up about this divisive movie.However I wouldn’t recommend paying to see it because there’s a 50:50 chance you’ll feel like you’ve been robbed of your cash, time and the fond memories you once held for a dead franchise."
1099,the-grand-budapest-hotel-movie,ziaHassan,3,"This movie and its 8+ rating perfectly shows, how holiwood has gone down. The drama never reaches climax in a weak story. Not many touching movie.

Keanu looks great, that's the only positive, I should give a one star, but I'll be nice...3 stars."
1101,harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-movie,SamX.,3," Let me start off by saying that the film in no way follows the book, and that to me this isn't really a bad thing because I hated the book as well. But, instead of adhering to the overhyped book's many followers, the director has managed to cut out half the book and fill it in with fast paced action. The atmosphere the film has has been pilfered straight out of the LotR trilogy, and the musical score was absolutely horrible. For someone who hasn't read the books it would seem confusing and shallow because there doesn't seem to be much of a story, unless a reader fills you in on all the gaps in the plot (of the book) that the film misses out."
1102,spirited-away-movie,SamS.,10," Even if you've never heard of this movie and are curious as to why it's on this top 10 list, you have reason enough to see it. You'll thank yourself later."
1103,horrible-bosses-2-movie,mijxero,2,"If you absolutely loved the first one you might like this one.  I thought the first one was okay, but everything good about that is gone.  It is just the three main characters being idiots and talking over each other as much as possible.  The whole story is painful to watch and the jokes, if there were any fell irritatingly flat for me.  The only funny performances were from Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Spacey who have a total time in the movie of about 4 minutes."
1104,rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie,blockofcheese,10,"""Amazing Reboot!!"", yes i said it, it's by far the best reboot I've ever witnessed. It's got stunning visual effects! Eye candy film... First time seeing this film, made me feel so satisfied, it almost made be believe that Apes could take over the world (although it is science fiction). This by far one of my all time favourite films, it hit every note for me. fantastic writing, captivating, and intriguing. It held my attention throughout the whole film.  100 out of 100!! an A+ Film!! Now to watch Dawn of the Planet of the Apes! :)"
1105,i-am-legend-movie,JayD.,10, Edy C...please learn the English language before writing another review.
1106,elizabeth-the-golden-age-movie,KevinC.,3," Very disappointing film. The history of this period is so interesting why not juat stick to the book? The worst is the portrayal of the Spanish, who come off like Orcs. Mary Stuart and all the the plots swirling around her were reduced to sound bites. The Raleigh thing would have been better as a movie on PBS (or Lifetime). Terrible camera work and sets. Editing, screenplay. I could go on. I guess the actors did the best they could, but GIGO. It's just not good, and that's too bad."
1107,pans-labyrinth-movie,DavidH.,10," Works on so many levels, intellectual and visceral, artistic, humanistic and historical, with gripping peformances, stunning visual effects that are seamlessly part of the narrative. The cinematography is rich and appropriate to the moment, the score unobtrusive but persuasive. What a vision this man has! To me, the most original film in a long time."
1108,what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting-movie,FabulousCity,10,These critics are nuts!!! And this is why I NEVER EVER believe what they say! The movie was hilarious!!! Love Cameron Diaz and the cast! True entertainment!!!!! Thank you!!!
1109,the-matrix-reloaded-movie,HatersWannaHate,8,"A good second installment, but this movie started the downward spiral of the Wachowskis' ability to edit/make a quality movie.  The middle portion of this movie is boring and irrelevant.  Also, Trinity was not as sexy in this movie.  Carrie-Anne Moss`had an injury and was not as fit as she was in the first film. Despite all that, I still liked the movie, but it could have been a classic."
1110,the-last-airbender-movie,Monkeylover,0," they cant create fire out of nothing, iroh isnt fat ( and now its eeroh) aang is now ong, sokka is Soekka appa is ugly momo is there but never even given a name, and just sits in thebackround, people are to serious, HORRIBLE ACTING except maybe dev pattel and ms. sparks, but thats because everyone around them sucks so much. fights are boring compared to the cartoon series, and there is no giant fish thing at the end. however it did have a nice explosion, and the end made me cry. because it was so horribly bad. oh, and no kiyosho warriors. who wouldn't want to see sokka in a dress for comedic effect?"
1111,jennifers-body-movie,TheangryOne,8,"Is it a hooror movie? Is it a horror comedy? I don't really know. What I do know is that it is pretty good. Admittedly, they could have found someone hotter than Megan Fox to play Jennifer considering the attention she drew both in and out of the movie, but I most certainly am not complaining about her looks at all. As for the movie itself, the plot is basically a hodgepodge of horror cliches, teenage stereotypes,  and  genuine WTF moments all spliced together surprisingly well. What I like most about the plot, however, is just how well the actors pull off what might be the most genuine worst case horror scenario ever played out. I won't spoil too much, but the heroine's reluctance (due to her relationship with the monster) to do what needs to be done plays out just long enough for you to empathize with her, but vanishes the very instant it starts to get annoying. The monster is also much more intelligent than most other horror predators. She carefully picks her victims (the insecure, shaken, or the egomaniacal), only attacks when she's absolutely sure she can make a clean getaway, and spaces out her killings to avoid unnecessary attention. This is what should be mainstream in horror movies; intelligence is the scariest thing you can face, and blind vengeance is the best weapon to fight it with. That being said, there are some issues I had with the movie. The first is the dialogue; some of the lines range from cheest at best to outright horrible at worst. Also, though I told you earlier that both heroine and monster are more intelligent than other horror stereotypes, there are some crazy WTF moments. The most obvious is when heroine and monster meet face to face for the first time. Again, I won't spoil much, but black vomit is involved, yet the heroine, either through denial or ignorance, pretends nothing is wrong for as long as she absolutely can, despite her best friend's life being at stake. Their next private encounter is supposed to be sexy (and you'll see why if you watch the movie), but I was on the edge of my seat just waiting for one of them to strike at the other. Nothing. When the encounter ended, I had to pause it for a second to wonder why that scene was shown at all. It just seemed like fluff since literally nothing said or done in it had any impact on the story. I know, it sounds like whining, but it's just an example; let's not even talk about the heroine and her boyfriend's relationship; I only have 2536 characters left. Long story short, this movie is definitely a step in the right direction for horror and horror comedy movies in general, and despite the actor's shortcomings, they definitely come off as human. The small town setting makes the perfect glue to hold it all together, and the simple fact that both monster and heroine actually think, feel, and react make the whole premise that much more real, and that much better."
1112,star-wars-episode-vi---return-of-the-jedi-movie,theinspector,8,"this should NOT have the same score as Attack the Clones, that was boring badly Written, and just a Big CGI-fest made to make money"
1113,rocknrolla-movie,konstantinK,8," Pretty decent considering his previous movies. still, corny premise."
1114,now-you-see-me-movie,Xandercz,3,"Visually appealing movie that is brought down by the very stupid and unbelievable twists that really stretch the suspension of disbelief. Heavy reliance on CGI when trying to show ""magic"" which breaks the illusion that the Four Horsemen are only illusionists. Add to that a pretty pointless and shoehorned romance subplot and you get Now You See Me."
1115,the-lords-of-salem-movie,lossa551,3,i found it to be boring and not very memorable it hurts me because rob zombie has not failed me before. it had some interesting elements and twists but not nearly enough to keep me interested at all.
1116,the-thin-red-line-movie,DaveC.,8," Malick might only make films once in a blue moon, but this is yet another jewel in his crown. The plot and structure might leave much to be desired but Malick demonstrates what he does best here. Capturing the awe-inspiring beauty and using it to provide context for a morality play. If you fancy an alternative to the condescending, sentimental approach of Spielberg in Saving Private Ryan as I did, I recommend this film highly."
1117,million-dollar-baby-movie,MattF.,3," I thought that this film was well-made; beautiful direction from Clint Eastwood and terrific performances from everyone in the cast. However, I had some problems with some of the material. The depiction of poor people in the film was ignorant and offensive; Haggis seems to think that all poor people are white-trash slobs who don't even care about their loved ones. Also, the film seems to think that one is better off dead than paralyzed, I suggest that Paul Haggis views ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" the best film of 2007, and a much finer picture than this one."
1118,the-5th-wave-movie,MediumUndead,0,This movie is Horrid It Has no Suspense  Half The Movie is Predictable And The action Scenes Are Horrible The concept is pretty Cool Actually But It Was Pulled Of Horribly
1119,oldboy-movie,bigbossluna,7,It's good but not as good as people make it out to be. Yeah the violence is pretty good and the twist is fascinating none the less. But at times I felt nothing for the main protagonist. It`s hard to care about him because there's really no info on the guy. And the room he stayed for 15 years is just so crazy and bizarre that it's hard to take the movie serious.
1120,sucker-punch-movie,guyweknow,3,"A horrible muddle of somewhat good intentions, let us start by rating it from good to bad.   Visual effects - 9. Nicely done, although a hiring qualification for modern visual directors should be to take them outside and make them stare up at that bright yellow orb in the sky. If they can properly name it as 'The Sun' then they're hired. I bet half or more flunk, including this film's director.   Acting - 5. Now, it's not to say they had much scripting, but their green screen talents are much in evidence, and I'd even give bonus points if they did any of their own stunts.   Costume - 4. Someone call Sailor Moon and tell her her costumes were stolen, just after you get done with the inventory of all the missing costumes for Showgirls.   Soundtrack - 3. Ok, unearthing the Airplane and White Rabbit is kitchy but ok. It was rock &amp; roll, after all, and they do just amp it up (but their cover singer is no Grace Slick, I'll tell you that, right out). But, after we hear the panoply from The Eurythmics to The Beatles and back it seems more like a transparent attempt to craft the next hipster soundtrack CD a la Pulp Fiction.    Script - ... what script? Oh, you mean the video game storyboards that passed for a script? Really, it's eye candy, but I wondered at how the test marketing worked. Was this really aimed at the 14 year old GRRRL Power crowd? If so, it misses badly with a script that is more like a recycled version of the musical Chicago meets Pan's Labyrinth. To their credit, and maybe to keep their PG rating, there is little human bloodshed. But, man do the japaname space hun nazi robot zombies get it with both barrels (and a katana).   As I told my viewing companions, once in a generation there is a movie better understood after splitting a lid of weed. This would make this film the newest 2001: A Space Odyssey. Heavy, man.â"
1121,a-cure-for-wellness-movie,MarcDoyle,8,"As a movie-lover, one of my rare delights is walking into a movie knowing virtually nothing about it.  Even after seeing the trailer a few times, I had no idea what expect.  I was blown away by this film, particularly by its visuals and its sound. The acting is also brilliant - especially that of Dane DeHaan and Mia Goth. It's clearly a movie that will keep giving on multiple viewings - I definitely plan to see it again soon.  I'd love to hear more about the making of this film."
1122,argo-movie,podunk411,7,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but Argo fell a little flat for me. Definitely an old-school spy caper with ""docudrama"" feel given the real story.  However several of the suspense/thriller moments felt contrived (though some were well done) including the ending act.  Ben Affleck was good, but probably miscast himself--which is a real career hazard when Actor turns Director. Really liked John Goodman and Alan Arkin as the Hollywood guys--overall, a pretty good film but as far as great (recent) spy capers to me: Tinker Tailor Solder Spy and the Bourne movies hold the top honors"
1123,godsend-movie,Deluge,3," Godsend is a terrible thriller. It's not worth watching in theaters, not worth renting it on DVD not even worth watching it on channel 45 if it airs on tv."
1124,the-coldest-city-movie,Bitash,1,"I have it a one cuz I like Charlize, but boy was this movie bad. I just can’t believe the characters and even Charlize is not believable, the English accent just kille dome, she can’t do it right, don’t get it and don’t believe her...and the accent .....like Angelina Jolie in Tombrader, its just bad. Just lots of scenes of Charlize kicking everyone’s ass while 80s music is playing. Have zero expectations and you may find it amusing."
1125,suicide-squad-movie,travellyn,3,This film is a different take on the super hero genres for starts its because there not super heroes whitch makes this a unique thing and the rest of the film is stole by will smith and margo Robbie and some pretty cool action and a simple enough script to keep you on board not a terible spin of from our new DC based franchise but had potential to aim higher
1126,pirates-of-the-caribbean-at-worlds-end-movie,CoryG.,10," This was one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I personally think that the critics are on a ""hate"" streak with all of the movies this summer. Whatever movie that we were expecting, they just crush it down into nothing. This movies visuals and storyline, as well as the actors, were all outstanding. This movie met and exceeded my expectations. The only thing that I would like there to be, is more. More movies to be coming. This is a movie worth watching over and over again."
1127,elysium-movie,gmnz,2,"I would like to point out that, Damon's posture was very similar with his Bourne role. Like the way he carries his backpack. That's bad. And the way the villain died, really that easy? The worst thing was the last part. The characters just do not fit."
1128,gemini-movie,AriaSalessi,7,"Gemini has two great female leads and a somewhat compelling story that makes you wonder, ""Who did it?"""
1129,the-godfather-movie,Christopher_G2,10,"This is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It's such amazingly well-acted, well-written movie with an epic story line that takes you through many themes like love, sadness, loyalty, revenge and betrayal is such an encompassing and totally believable way. I will never get tired of watching this masterpiece."
1130,this-is-the-end-movie,sbuccini,8,"This movie, while crass, is refreshing in its honesty. It's great fun to see some of the biggest names in the business poke fun at each other. Definitely worth watching, but save it for a night out with the bros rather than a date with your significant other."
1131,taken-movie,GarrettS.,10," For everybody out there reading this, Taken deserves MUCH better than a 50%. While at times, i will admit the story-line is a bit unbelievable, it is definitely not as bad as the movie critics are saying. The action is fast paced and intense, Liam Neeson playing superbly well as the loving father, that if need be, can become a complete bad ass ready to crack some heads. The story is not terrible either. Unbelievable at times? Maybe. But good none the less. I definitely recommend this movie to any Liam Neeson fans, or anyone who likes action movies."
1132,rush-movie,Domgwy,7,"Set against the decedent and dangerous backdrop of 1976’s Formula One World Championship, Ron Howard’s latest true 20th Century story focuses on the bitter rivalry between Brit James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl).Reuniting with screenwriter Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon, The Last King of Scotland) Howard’s dynamic style and keen eye for period pieces bring the proceedings that Spielbergian sense of a heightened reality. From the choice soundtrack to Hunts flamboyant wardrobe the style effortlessly evokes the 1970’s while resisting the temptation for nostalgia.The films greatest strength is the ambiguous nature with which it treats the central characters. Both Hunt and Lauda are presented as flawed, driven men, though completely different from one another in their approaches to the sport. It is never made clear who we are to root for and as the season has its ups and downs audience allegiances will turn almost from race to race.Hemsworth brings the same affable arrogance to Hunt as he did to his most famous creation but is also given an opportunity to add layers to the man and as the film progresses it becomes more and more clear that the cocksure attitude and flippant disregard for life frequently displayed by Hunt is only skin deep.Brühl’s passionate Lauda drives the film with a sheer minded focus and determination that can at times be both admirable and incomprehensible.Through strong performances, dynamic direction and a sharp and evenly weighted script, Rush transcends its Formula One backdrop to focus on the nature of rivalry, sportsmanship and risk. Like all great rivalry films (see The Prestige, Warrior) it will split your allegiances, make you sympathize with and at times detest its characters and entertain regardless of your interest in the subject matter."
1133,the-green-hornet-movie,somali2,1,"The casting for the Hornet was all wrong - the personality was all wrong - great story, that really sucked due to bad casting / persona decisions !! Kato character was great - the last 5 minutes was the movie - unfortunately"
1134,fed-up-movie,Brent_Marchant,8,"A well-researched, thoroughly documented indictment of the food industry and its practice of putting profits before public health, often with the tacit blessing of those in officialdom. Despite some occasional issues with the flow of the material and a tendency toward repetition, the film nevertheless makes its case effectively and intelligently. A must-see for anyone who cares about what they eat."
1135,inside-llewyn-davis-movie,melfotog,1,"The most idiotic, pointless, boring waste of time in a movie theater I experienced in a long time.  There was not one scene worth watching or anything about this film that is worth remembering. I have seen Lawrence of Arabia many time, all 4 hours of it ,and it seemed much shorter than this pathetic bore. I do not know how anyone could write anything positive about this film."
1136,jaws-movie,PenutButtaJelay,8,"While there are some cheesy moments, the performances and the outstanding special effects at the time make this a well put together grounded thriller."
1137,the-last-house-on-the-left-movie,jason,10," This movie is absolutely the most intense and brutal thing Ive ever seen. At the same time it is entirely believable. Its not really a horror movie but a really intense drama. The acting was prefect, every actor just displayed crazy depth of emotion. Although if you cant tolerate serious rape/death scenes then this isn't the movie for you."
1138,enron-the-smartest-guys-in-the-room-movie,Taylor,2, Interesting scandal. Horrible movie! So poorly put together.
1139,a-royal-affair-movie,nutterjr,8,"A European film which does not lack the luster of the Hollywood films, but however still intelligent and substantial.  This film takes a fascinating chapter in Danish history, little-known to general public, and presents it engagingly. The direction, acting and production are all top notch and worthy of the Oscar nod from the American Academy."
1140,che-part-two-movie,PaulS.,2," I did not pay 15 dollars to see 5 hours of a man trudging through harsh terrain. I get it; his life was hard. I learned little about the man or the history surrounding his life in five hours, which seems like an imposssibility but is true. I was angry with myself for staying in the theater for the whole film, but I kept thinking this movie might get better. This is an apic failure on Soderbergh's part."
1141,transformers-movie,davidf.,1, michael bay's transformers is the equivalent of limp bizkit covering a beatles' song.
1142,the-way-way-back-movie,waterpolodude,9,"One of the best movies i have ever seen. it was a movie which had a mixture of comedy, romance and adventure which really brought out the best of the movie. It really touches your heart and shows you how a shy boy like ""Duncan"" becomes someone who is confident about himself through the help of his friends. A MUST-WATCH MOVIE!!"
1143,the-hunger-games-catching-fire-movie,AGarcia732,9,"While the first Hunger Games movie was a bit lackluster and disappointing, the 2nd film does justice to the book and the author. Jennifer Lawrence was a bit emotionless in the first film (although maybe Katniss really would've been like that), but she improves her acting for the second film. The other victors like Beetee, Finnick, and Johanna were great. (Johanna was especially funny!) The rest of cast is good too, even though I feel like characters such as Cinna and Prim weren't in the movie enough (but unfortunately you can't fit everything from the book into the movie). Besides the victors, the addition of Presidents Snow's granddaughter was a nice touch. Things from the book were adapted well for the movie,  and to sum it all up this movie was really good. I can't wait for the next movie! The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 will be  released November 2014 and Part 2 in 2015.

1148,there-will-be-blood-movie,MarkDuffy,7,"This is quite likely the most overrated film of the year.  Overall, this film is very strongly character driven.  Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Bano create intriguing characters that save an otherwise lifeless plot.  The soundtrack is great and the characters intriguing but I simply found myself wanting more.  There is nothing to ""get"" in this movie.  The film is rather heavy handed on its critiques of society, greed, etc.  Succinctly, this film drags you through the rise and fall of an intriguing character at a slow pace with a hollow ending."
1149,indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull-movie,Bullet97,10,"What the heck is with all the negative critisism? This movie is awesome! It feels exactly like an old fashioned Indy movie! Granted, its not as good as those movies, but who would expect it to be? The acting is great, the action is intense and lots of fun, and the same adventurous atmosphere that made the others so much fun is back full throttle! Yes, it's very unrealistic, but what Indy movie is? Yes, I didn't really like the whole alien thing, but that's the only thing I didn't like about it. Overall, KOTCS is a great installment in the amazing franchise."
1150,lovely-still-movie,Lyn,3,"Ellen Burstyn is lovely, still. And Martin Landau is still an actor of great skill ... but this film doesn't do either of them justice. First you suspend your disbelief with a plot focused on late-in-life love at first sight. THEN you're asked to buy in to a disturbing twist that makes it a whole different kind of movie. You could handle the upsetting aspects of the twist if you hadn't already stretched yourself to invest in the initial premise! I actually bought this DVD thinking it would be a nice gift for a friend, but abandoned that idea because it's too damned depressing."
1151,the-muppets-movie,zizzoT,9,"A good spirited film, with a lot of heart. Perfect for the little ones. Though it's also clever and witty, and I think adults will thoroughly enjoy it as well. Adorable."
1152,catwoman-movie,Jbrizzy,2,"Imma be honest, as much as Catwoman is may favorite Superhero /Antihero of all time, this film was just B.A.D, I originally saw this when i was 12 and didn't know a bad movie from a good one. BUT, seeing it today makes me want to jump in a time machine just to get my $7.25 back. Like how do directors screw up source material? Anybody coulda went to wikipedia, look up Catwoman, and write a better script than this ""movie"". I give this a two because Halle Berry would made a believable Catwoman if the script wasnt trash, and the i absoulutly love the music in this movie."

1156,the-wolverine-movie,swamptech,3,"Hard to believe a film could make Wolverine:Origins seem like a decent film.  I have no clue how a character such as Wolverine, who's foundation was cemented in the Frank Miller mini series cannon, can be botched this badly.  The work (story, mood, sub-plots, characters, etc) had already been done.....how could you screw this up? The movie rambles pointlessly after Logan gets to Japan and never completes until it ruins Logan's experience in Japan, the Silver Samurai character, and needlessly introduces the Viper character (what was the point of her molting and taking off her outfit......only to put it back on and be in the same form?). This movie makes my head hurt"

1162,inside-man-movie,WillieG.,0," This is truly one of the worst films I've ever seen. On several occasions, this mess was nothing more than thinly veiled racial jabs masquerading as a crime thriller that goes nowhere. We see Spike's usual M.O. on display throughout the film, which basically amounts to making caucasians feel guilty about...well being caucasians. Spike Lee was in way over his head on this one. Case in point...Lee is the only dolt transparent enough to cast Jodie Foster as a manipulative power broker (who's white of course since white=manipulative in Spike Lee joints) then proceed to name the character Ms. White. Even the overt racial sarcasm falls flat as his breathless pursuit of half cocked social commentary drags this sophomoric production down to the abyss of most forgettable films of all time."

The villain ultimately extends their hand in partnership to the jedi who in turn rejects this. The jedi loses their lightsaber in this confrontation shortly after having a great truth revealed about their lineage.   Meanwhile…A young roguelike hero, following a close engagement with the enemy, seeks brief refuge and support from a fellow roguelike on a planet seemingly unaffiliated and unaffected by the galactic conquest. The hero is eventually betrayed by the roguelike and handed over to the enemy forces. Also…A great battle takes place on a planet consisting of mostly large white flat surfaces.

1165,captain-america-civil-war-movie,JurassicParkFan,10,"Every character in the film is fleshed out perfectly with each getting their moments, but focuses on captain america since this is a captain america movie. the action, visuals, and cinematography is amazing! The airport battle scene one of the best, if not, the best action scene I had seen in film history. Spider-Man and Black Panther is awesome in the movie and I cant wait to see them in their own solo movie. the villain was also good. better than most villains in the MCU only behind Loki and Winter Solider. I give it a 10/10. Go watch the movie. It is worth it!"

This movie was fun, inspiring, filled with great messages, and it is absolutely hilarious. Jason Segel did a more than amazing job writing and starring in this film. He did the classic Muppets justice in this new, hilarious entry into the Muppets excellent line of movies. You must see this movie whether your a muppet fan like me or no. You will be rolling on the floor laughing, i promise. One of my favorite movies of 2011. 10/10 without a doubt"
1168,x-men-the-last-stand-movie,VerbalKinch,3, One point for premise. A really brillant premise. Second point for the ole' Colossus Wolvie fastball special. Third point for the full Iceman transformation. Thats all folks. This is a ROTJ-go-out-with-a-bang installment that RUINs the comic book cannon. At least Jabba and the Warwick Davis in a teddy ruxpin getup looked good on a BURGER KING glass back in '84.The twist after the credits was the smartest move of the whole flick. The flashback recruitment of.
1169,duplicity-movie,JayP,0," 1. Don't waste your time and money. I am officially breaking up with Julia Roberts after this movie. I can't believe she signed on to do such a bad flick 2. If you have to see it, wait for it to hit the discount isle at the vidoe store. Then you can pause/rewind to say WTF just happened? 3. If you are a prisioner or being punished by your wife and HAVE to go see it at the theater, take a notepad and pencil. It is very, very, very confusing and twisted. It ends worse than bad sex. If there was a ""satisfaction or your money back"", I would be due some cash back. 4. Never, Never let anyone compare it to Mr and Mrs Smith. That is like comparing filet mignon to dry dog-food If I am ot making myself clear: This may be the worst movie that I have ever paid to see. I sat through the whole damn thing knowing it would get better, or at least get to see Julia Roberts in sexy outfits. My bad. I should have ask the the Theater Manager if he had something more fun that I could do, like sweep the parking lot."
1170,pride-and-glory-movie,Janschie,7,"The compelling reason to see this movie is Edward Norton.  There are other fine casting choices, including Jon Voigt, just about all of the female actors and ethnic participants, some of whom are non-actors, but very real.  The story is no better than a typical Third Watch episode, but better than a standard NYPD story.  Why it took so long to make is a reflection of the producer's lack of focus, or maybe too much focus.  Colin Ferrel looks totally out of place and makes very little contribution to his role. Some of the plot is downright ridiculous and the ending is stupid.  But, there is enough to draw an interested if limited viewer.  There is lots of f-bombs, which seem totally out of place, and just made up to be made up.  There is a very sensitive scene with the Chief's cancer ridden wife.  The relationships among the cops makes one ask, would that be allowed?  To be honest, it is not a good movie.  But, because of Norton and a few other gritty character performances, it has merit.  The DVD is a ""making of"" and is generally so self-centred on the director himself, as if there was nothing else going on in the world. Skip it."
1171,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,adasiukevich,9,Overall the film was great. There are definitely some valid criticisms but overall the good heavily outweighed the bad. It's a fantastic way to start off a new trilogy.
1172,300-movie,DougR.,3," Beautiful to look at for about 2 mins, then it gets old and even annoying. Action is bland. Acting is atrocious. Direction is completely uneven."
1173,skyline-movie,Puffinparoxysm,0,This is the worst movie in history. Other than the last airbender.  Between bad actors and even worse filming. This movie will go down in history as how to perform cinematic suicide.
1174,arrival-movie,magnusgrafex,1,"I'm sorry I don't know how this movie got such good reviews. It was dumb dumb dumb and boring. I would describe it as a chick-flick sci-fi movie. Don't bother seeing it and these high reviews are way off. Must be the ""different"" effect. Different does not = good."
1175,untitled-star-trek-sequel-movie,Trepe,8,"Star Trek into Darkness is a good addition to the Star Trek franchise which goes some way in fleshing out the world in a believable light. The character development (of Spock and Kirk in particular) is interesting to watch and the cast bring a sense of depth to their characters that goes beyond the script. Benedict Cumberbatch and Simon Pegg give standout performances and steal every scene they are in. They are a joy truly a joy to watch. The rest of my review contains minor spoilers and I wouldn't advise reading it if you haven't already seen the movie! Now I've got  the good points out of the way I would just like to point out a couple of things which let the movie down and that I was disappointed with (I still enjoyed the movie). A man blows himself up along with hundreds of others to save his daughter (who incidentally has already been saved in the previous scene, so why bother). He is willing to put his daughters life before the lives of hundreds (if not thousands) of others! I can understand wanting to save his daughter at any cost, but this is hard to swallow. Khan transports to a planet and Kirk and crew set off in pursuit to fire 72 rockets at him? Really? This just seems ludicrous to me and a little over the top. Also once they get there they alert Kahn to the fact that they plan to do this. Again, really? He transported across the galaxy what's to say he wouldn't do that again now he knows rockets are pointed at him. These awkward moments in story telling are major plot points and should have been handled much better than this. Those are just two of the awkward plot points that spoiled the movie a little for me. There are others, but I think those are two of the most glaring problems with the plot and I don't want to focus too much on what was wrong with an otherwise good movie."
1176,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,bubba5,0,"I'm not sure why the early viewers were sworn to secrecy. If anyone did leak the script, nobody would have believed this nonsensical and ridiculous ripoff of a storyline would be authentic. Good Things BB8, Chewie, Falcon Bad Things Everything Else especially Kylo Ren. A three year old girl doesn't cry as much as that whiny emo dumbo eared imitation Darth Vader. Numerous characters seemed to be added for toy sales, because they served nothing to the movie. Captain Phasma was supposedly a main character, but she only had a handful of lines in a 2.5hr movie. Better off to watch Spaceballs, because it has more in common with Star Wars than this movie."
1177,eight-crazy-nights-movie,DeanFalcon,3,"It seems to be going in a How the Grinch Stole Christmas story, where an angry jerk hates the holiday cheer and festivity, but eventually would redeem himself of his ways. Which is why a movie like this fails, it’s pretty unoriginal, which makes this really predictable. Also, this story is supposed to be a character-driven story, but the problem is that the main character is such and likeable dickhead. Not to mention, it goes out of it’s way to throw various amounts of product placement to where it becomes a part of the story. Also, they try to throw in as many gross-out jokes as possible, from fart jokes, crap jokes, or others. But at least, it had a bit of structure to follow. So, the story is definitely crappy, but in its own sense was even worse than would expect. Now regarding on the animation, this is the strongest thing about this movie by a landslide. If you think that's a great thing, it really isn't, regarding the worst parts of this are just way bad. However, this on the other hand is pretty tremendous. The animation seems to go in a more of a style like Iron Giant or Osmosis Jones, which is understandable for new and unique animated films of the late 90’s and early 2000’s. The thing with both of the other films have their strong point where they'd stand out from the crowd. Like Osmosis Jones and their use of facial expressions and character design. For Iron Giant, it's definite strong point is the Giant himself, and the wonderful character design and expressions. Here however, they have nothing special that'll make it visually stand out. I'll give credit that they have great character animation, good and subtle use of CGI. But at times, the animation can be limited, and the gross out factor really does show, and makes this sort of unwatchable. So the animation is still good, I guess that'll be something to be remembered here.With the characters, I am very surprised. That these are the most unlikeable, annoying, insufferable characters I've seen in a long time. Sure, you can say Whitey would be be a good character, but his voice is so annoying. His sister, Eleanor is an easy throwaway. Benjamin, a kid that befriends Davey, who'd seem like a good character but doesn't get much screen time and is only appearing in one whole scene which is useless filler. Jennifer, Benjamin's mother, who is just a love interest. And we got Davey himself, the most unlikeable main character I've ever seen in an animated movie, who is careless to everyone and just does the worst things from giving Whitey a Porta Potty ride to speeding through his town and destroying property. Also, a quick mention to the company mascots, who only appear during a song and is there just for product placements. Overall, the characters are definitely the worst part of this feature, and I’m just lucky the movie bombed, so I can never see these characters again.I wouldn't want to mention the very forgettable songsDon't watch this unless you love Adam Sandler and his movies"
1178,tinker-tailor-soldier-spy-movie,Visenya,7,"No one can really dispute that the acting was fantastic. It is probably some of Gary Oldman's best work, and the entire cast did a great job. The imagery is great as well, and really adds to the setting of the entire movie. There are quite a few times when the shots say more than any of the character's words do. However, the pacing seemed to hit and miss. Sometimes it rushed ahead and you were sitting on the edge of your seat, and then sometimes it would seem to get lost and you couldn't wait for the scene to be over because it was just dragging on for too long. This is a movie that most people are going to need to see twice. Its complex and deep, and most people are going to come out of the theater confused about some of the finer points in the conspiracy. I recommend this movie, but any viewer should know that they can't just sit through the movie and trust it to spoon-feed you everything. You are going to have to think. But if you pay enough attention, you will be rewarded."
1179,shopgirl-movie,BenH.,0," Horrible movie. It was slow, pointless, and boring. How many times do I need to see Claire Dane's character shave her legs in this movie? I was confused watching the movie and I am still confused how anyone in their right mind could have enjoyed it. Wow. Honestly, I can say this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life. Avoid it all costs. I still can't even believe I wasted my time on this crap."
1180,the-babadook-movie,HaithamB,10,"Essie Davis is electrifying in ""The Babadook"", and the storyline itself is profound and crawly. Jennifer Kent's debut is an exemplary tale of catastrophe and tepidity."
1181,queen-of-the-damned-movie,BerC,2,"The artistic medium of film is very subjective. Every audience member has a different set of criteria they use to measure their viewing experience. Not everyone shares the same set of criteria. If we did, what a bland and uninspired world this would be. What I Personally Liked About ""Queen of the Damned"":The very beginning of the opening credits over the stone statues set an incredible tone which, sadly, cannot be maintained through the rest of the film. It's such a shame that all hope is smashed so shortly thereafter once the narration of Lestat commences. Really, the only strong recommendation I can give that lifts this film up is the presence of the late musician Aaliyah embodying the titular role. The slinkiness she brings ensures that her character will be remembered long after the movie is over. Indeed, she carries with her an almost supernatural sensuality that few actresses possess. It is too bad there was not a better film to surround her torrid role. What I Personally Disliked About ""Queen of the Damned"":Stuart Townsend is supposed to be the centerpiece of this production. However, he is a pale imitation next to the maniacal impression left by his predecessor Tom Cruise. He is too dry and uninvolving. He simply exists as a typical vampire with none of the traits that made Lestat who he was in the first film. Almost every other major player in this movie (Marguerite Moreau, Vincent Perez, Paul McGann, etc.) is equally as terrible which is surprising consider how wonderful some of their acting has been in other features. This brings me to Lena Olin portraying Aunt Maharet. Lena, why were you involved in this motion picture? Seriously, you're better than this! (Think: ""Romeo is Bleeding"" and ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"") What happened? Did you need the money? Were you locked in an ironclad contract? Let's move beyond the quote/unquote talent for a moment and take a look at some of the other elements of the film. ""Queen"" doesn't have half of the wit or the willingness to shock its audience with its warped perversity and unbridled carnage as ""Interview With the Vampire."" It feels like it's holding back; like it's a watered down rendition playing exclusively for the Hollywood executives and not for the same crowd that adored ""Interview."" They also combined elements from two Anne Rice novels instead of letting each one stand on its own merit in the cinematic world. By cherry-picking certain elements from the pair of books, the filmmakers proved they had absolutely no understanding of the source material. The lack of any real cohesion between ""Queen"" and ""Interview"" is more fuel on that fire. Why piggyback on the shoulders of greatness if you are going to be so disrespectful to both the previous film and the novels on which this entry was based? Some of the special effects are simply atrocious as well. It's hard to believe this film was released eight years after ""Interview"" when its effects look like they were created eight years before its predecessor. A lot of the visual tricks used are amateurish at best (the ""fast motion"" of the vampires) or outright headache-inducing at worst (the ""vampire mind flashes"" Lestat has when he connects with Akasha and the slow motion walk between Lestat and Jesse). Finally, the generic hard rock music sprinkled throughout the picture. It's faceless. It's toneless. It's soulless. I didn't realize ""plastic metal""  actually existed until I saw this film. And I thought Guns N' Roses's version of ""Sympathy for the Devil"" was horrible from ""Interview."" Ha! That was not even close to the rubbish this film presents to us. My Overall Impression of ""Queen of the Damned"":Between the glossed over combination of two novels serving as one film, special effects that look like they were crafted from eighties' nerds using a Commodore 64, and a cast list that plays like the rejects from a bad romance novel, this less than thrilling follow-up to ""Interview With the Vampire"" should have been shelved in developmental hell where it belonged. It's hard to believe there are worse films in existence than this one...but there are."

1186,mission-impossible---ghost-protocol-movie,Apemonkey666,7,Pixar's Brad Bird makes his live-action debut with the second best M:I film in the series.

1187,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,RunePl,0,"TFA had almost no plot and childish enemies. It was not a true sequel to ROTJ because it had no backstory or setting whatsoever to tie the movies together, much less provide much of a setting with explanations for this movie itself. It really seemed like an implausible Marvel snoozefest with no internal consistency or logic. The camera worked sometimes but other times was very unflattering with strange soap opera angles and unbelievably awkward closeups. FWIW, I didnt mind Rey, Finn, or even Kylo Ren, but the movie can't break a ""1"". Waited 20 years for this, shouldnt be too hard to write even a generic plot with some minimal backstory. One good thing: I finally was able to appreciate and enjoy the prequels."
1188,jurassic-world-movie,MD5774,1,"Jurassic World is a copy and paste  film of Jurrasic Park. But Jurrasic Park had a original story . This train wreck takes place years after Jurassic Park and no one learned anything from the destruction or character traits from dinosaurs .Whenever anyone see a movie with dinosaurs , that are free to roam around on an island , and there are not any form of high tech military weaponry or machinery , you will witness one of the worst films ever made."
1189,elizabeth-the-golden-age-movie,ArthurC.,3," Elizabeth was a stunning, moving historical epic that got all the intimate moments right. This one fails on every level. The epic scenes are ridiculous (How can you screw up the Spanish Armada battle?) with over the top histrionics that plays better like a soap opera than anything truly meaningful. We spend small amounts of time on the history and too much time on a ridiculous triangle with Elizabeth, Bess, and Sir Walter Raleigh. I am truly disappointed with this, after looking so forward to a movie that could equal Elizabeth. The Helen Mirren TV miniseries doesn't even show the Spanish Armada battle, but did a better job of conveying the subtext that the battle had on the queen and her people. Here, it feels like more of an inconvenience. Also, there was a definite emotional connection between Elizabeth and Mary, Queen of Scots that is glossed over in the movie, so when she is upset at her death, Elizabeth appears to be unreasonable and ridiculous just because ""she killed a queen."" Oh, and let's not get into the suspect history either. See the original, but avoid this one."
1190,the-thin-red-line-movie,usmcsm,1,"A great book turned into a crappy film. This is the second screen adaptation, attempted adaptation, of James Jones classic novel, and both fail miserably.

1191,the-book-of-eli-movie,Justin,2," This movie really sucked and I felt, for the first time in my life, that I probably deserved a refund for having to sit through such a mess. The characters are shallow, things seem to happen without cause, and the plot just winds its way arbitrarily throughout the movie. Every major actor in this movie is horribly unbelievable. How is Mila Kunis living in a complete hell and still manages to have jeans that fit her and aviators? Don't go see this if you've already seen The Road because you'll be severely disappointed."
1192,the-lord-of-the-rings-the-return-of-the-king-movie,VinceRocks123,10,"Peter Jackson wields his wizardly holy direction to astounding heights in the final chapter of Tolkien's LOTR franchise with the magnificent Return of the King, which easily will be remembered as one of the greatest movies of all time. With Sauron's forces closing overshadowing almost all of middle earth, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) with the aid of Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) must fulfill his destiny as the rightful king of Gondor, as they lead a united army in a final stance against Sauron's forces on the peak of Minus Tirith (in one of the most longest expensive and visually well edited battle sequence ever caught on film). Meanwhile as Frodo closes in on the mountain of Doom, the rings' power goes out of control far than he can bear as its evil influence begin to corrupt him, with its infatuation on his eyes. Gollum once known as the treasonous hobbit Smeagol (Andy Serkis in his finest performance yet) also falls once again prey to the rings' seductive power as he plots to betray Frodo to once again reclaim the ring, and amidst the chaos Sam is framed to be against Frodo by Gollum, pitying the odds to be winning in Sauron's favor that threatens to seal the fate of Middle Earth once and for all. Spectacular in both visual direction, cinematography, as well as the action sequences, the film also improves more on the performances especially Wood, Serkis, and Billy Boyd as Samwise as it displays them giving into the rings destructive power, with a detailed flashback of Smeagol's encounter with the Ring and how it destroyed his character forever, helmed by a much more masterful directing by Jackson. Hands down the best trilogy as I conclude my triple 5 star review wrapping in the finest writing I can muster.Winner of 11 academy awards including best picture, the film is more enhanced in epic scope and powerful in being a magnificent  chapter to be seen to believe."

It engages the audience right form the beginning and never lets go. As stated before I've yet to see the original but via parodies and pop culture references, I have the basic knowledge of the original.

1199,deadpool-2-movie,RealMuthaF,9,"Finally, after all the underwhelming repetitive single-use superhero flicks Deadpool returns to save the day.Deadpool 2 is the exemplary sequel - it just takes all the original's ingredients and carefully improves upon them.The first movie felt a bit confined with just a couple of locations due to its low budget - this one feels like a proper blockbuster. The first had modest action - here the amount, scale and choreography (thanks to director Devit Leitch) of fight scenes is heightened noticeably. The situation with jokes here is on par with the original - there are a lot of them, some don't work, but many do and the overall impression is very much favorable, there are plenty of laughs to be had here. The sheer number of characters involved is also increased, which does leave some with little screen time, like Negasonic Warhead.Had it not been for the stretched-out ending and a few story hiccups, this might've even been a 10/10 contender. While WB keep wasting their comic universe's potential and Disney keeps spitting out generic junk of descending quality, Deadpool 2 manages to be as good as its predecessor and set directly set things up for sequels. And I say, keep them coming."

1201,gods-of-egypt-movie,Gyrusho,3,"Gods of Egypt: Flat, Cgi, great actors, and a story (somewhere deep hidden in the movie). When i saw the title i thought: ""Hey, another Clash of the Titans movie or a kind of sequel"". When i took a look at the cast, which was pretty flushed in comparison to the Clash of the Titans cast, i noticed it was, once again, another Egypt ""God Movie"". The movie started pretty fast with the introduction of the story and main characters but after about 10 minutes i still was like the plot has to be introduced. The characters were too briefly introduced which led to a lot of  ""Oh that one in the beginning"". and the plot was in my opinion severely lacking in depth. I did not expect the characters to contain the emotional depth as a Spielberg movie, although when certain events happened in the movie, i found them very poorly integrated into the development of the character and certainly a lack of emotional state of mind. I had a feeling the whole movie was one of another ""I want my revenge"" movie with a lot of to narrowly made up characters and a story which was rather thin and boring. Watch if:-You like Egyptian style movies with a lot of Egyptian mythology-You want to see Gerald butler a rather different role-Jamie Lanister Don't watch if:-You seek for a well crafted story line with in-depth character development-You are an archaeologist and you want the movie to contain a correct depiction of the Egyptian mythology"
1202,inside-man-movie,SteveO.,2," I agree that the best part of this movie is the trailer on TV. Unnecessary social commentary inserted into useless waste of time scenes (at one point, denzel instructs a low level patrolman not to use ethnic slurs and the bank robber owen tries to steer a child away from playing a violent video game, lame for a supposed heist movie) jodie foster's character was useless and the acting belonged in ""mean girls"". If you're looking for a plot with standard rising action/climax/falling action don't expect any from this film. Yes I understand the ending but that doesn't mean that it was clever or interesting. Over half of the theater waited throughout the entire ending credits with a desperate hope that they would eventually get there money's worth and a portion of the plot would be seen to completion. no such luck. Loose ends are everywhere from the role of clive owen's fellow bank robbers to how the robbers got all of their information to how they were at all connected to Case. Although Denzel's observation that ""this ain't no bank robbery"" is correct, I was disappointed with the ""deep"" and ""complex"" conspiracy that for some reason involved the mayor of new york, although his character seemed unaware of even his own role halfway through the movie"
1203,cirque-du-freak-the-vampires-assistant-movie,Bman2095,0,"This was a movie I was very excited for. I love The Cirque Du Freak novels and Darren Shan's books in general. The books give a mysterious mood and show a more darker side to vampires as compared to 'Twilight' or 'the Vampire diaries.' But, the movie of Cirque Du Freak is  a comedy, having almost no relation to the characters I loved in the novels. I hated this movie, even when not compared to the books the poor acting, plot  and digital effects makes it not enjoyable. Hopefully if they make a sequel (which is unlikely because of the poor critical response and box office failure) they will correct their flaws."

And also like the prequels, it´s badly execute: bad writing, bad direction, wooden acting, a romance subplot that is lousy and painful, bad action scenes with bad cgi, the most poorly executed lightsaber fight in the whole saga (yes, even worse than the one in episode IV), Yoda jumping around with a little green lightsaber, ridiculous clone subplot to justify a line of dialogue of episode IV, an attempt to ruin Bobba Fett´s character by casting a bad child actor to play his younger self, and the list goes on. The soundtrack is good, though, mainly Across the Stars, the love theme of Anakin and Padme, too bad it´s the theme of a very poorly written romance. Also, both Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee show pretty solid acting , considering that is Lucas giving them directions and writing their lines."
1212,skyfall-movie,Phorosis,2,"In a word, disappointing. Javier Bardem's character had the potential to be one of the most memorable villains in the franchise. After his introduction you really felt this was going to get good. Smart, charismatic, and the resources to take over the world. Instead we get this creepy guy's confusing witch hunt to kill M (? Why not just blow her up??). Just bizarre that we are expected to root for characters like Bond and M, when we literally have no reason to. He's a dick and she's a  The hot bond girl featured in all the commercials has like a 10 minute spot. Where is the evil Bond girl? As people here have already stated, if this wasn't a Bond movie it would be alright. I could buy the betrayal, revenge plot but as a Bond movie it was missing almost every ingredient. Finally, my ears are still bleeding from that awful intro song."
1213,gravity-movie,Ellac,2,It was almost an amazing film and I almost believed Sandra Bullock wasn't Sandra Bullock but I have never gone from being so engrossed in a movie to so uninterested and it's all because of their crappy physics. We are asked to suspend belief beyond belief. They set up the rules for the physics by overemphasizing it in the beginning and then we have to swallow that the rules don't apply later on in the film in order to accept the new plot turn. I couldn't do it.

1216,georgia-rule-movie,GeorgeB.,0," How could so much fine acting talent be lured into this very junior version of a bad Off-Off-Broadway play? Step onstage from another room, say something, turn around and return off-stage. Adding Hull Idaho added nothing - sorry but its mountain and lake beauty was overwhelmed by this bad production.

1218,the-wrestler-movie,Spangle,8,"I am not even a wrestling fan, but I loved this. It is truly more than your average sports film, thanks to the brilliant performance by Mickey Rourke as the aging wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. He truly embodies his character, possibly because his career so closely resembles it, since he used to be huge and then fell off the map for a while. However, here, he firmly cements his place in history with a phenomenal acting performance. Marisa Tomei is also great here (she makes a great stripper, as expected) and Evan Rachel Wood does a great job as Rourke's daughter. The direction from Darren Aronofsky is also characteristically strong. While I personally prefer ""The Fountain"" and ""Black Swan"", ""The Wrestler"" is a fantastic addition to his filmography. The film is touching, triumphant, and moving, in all the best ways and will have you standing up and cheering by the end. The soundtrack is also great here with all the tracks from the 80's being a clear throwback to the days when ""The Ram"" reigned supreme. The cinematography is great and whole look and feel work really well here. Overall, The Wrestler is a film that succeeds in really every way imaginable thanks to the dynamite pairing of Aronofsky and Rourke."
1219,independence-day-resurgence-movie,uniqueland,0,"candidate for worst movie ever.  A complete waste of  time.  Over the top special effects like watching fireworks on 4th of July.   Visually interesting in a bad CGI sort of way but with no plot behind it or no interesting characters, it incredibly actually becomes boring.  Zero suspense, the script looks like it was writtn by a 6 year old.  Formulmatic to the point of any rudimentary script writint software program could have written this formulmatic scrip with the press of a buton.  did anyone watching it really think we weren't going to be victorious in spite of all odds against us.  I am surprised there was not a mandate to the viewers at the end asking us to stand up and cheer while they rolled the credits with the audience giving high five's to one another.  I, for one, was at the edge of my seat with white knuckles wondering if we were going to make it or not (sarcasm intended).  And how can any serious actor allow himself to be in a movie where he has to read a line that actually says ""now you are a true warrior"". are they kidding me?  And Jeff Daniels gets to say, ""we didn't win last time because of luck, we won because of our resolve""  OMG, make it stop, please!!!!  I guess it is a good movie, if you are 5 yeasr old.  The escapr from the alien space craft as the exit was closing was very cool in the first movie.  Doing the exact same thing the second time, just was not the same thing.  Really couldn't they find anyone out ther wjo could actually write a screenplay?"
1220,the-a-team-movie,JSet,10," Saw it toiday, and it was a good movie. Although it wasn't the best movie, the critics are just idiots.

Case closed."
1221,fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-movie,Legoguy6100,10,"As a huge fan of the Harry Potter movies, I was absolutely blown away by this film. From the nostalgic opening titles and classic score to the stunning visuals, this film more then exceeded the hype and expectations surrounding it, prior to its release. Like every film, this one had it's problems, including recycled elements from the original Harry Potter movies. These factors include an overly abusive adoptive family (physically and mentally) as well as constant visits to an orphanage. These two factors were unnecessary- but didn't take too much time away from the mysterious marvel that was the rest of the film. A lot of things were cut out of the movie, as expected from a film from a series like this. The words ""I want to be a wizard"" were never said. Newt never stops in front of the police offers and says ""You have absolutely nothing to worry about."" The scene in which Newt stands on a roof top in daylight with two others next to him? Never shown. All complaints aside, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. This film was at the top of my list for most anticipated films for the year- and it didn't disappoint. This is truly a flick that will satisfy long-time fans of the Wizarding World, as well as welcome viewers to the incredible universe."
1222,central-intelligence-movie,JunelKean,8,"Calvin (Hart) was at the peak of his life in high school and Robbie (Johnson) was the fat guy who was bullied every time. 20 years later, they bumped to each other and it looks that things have switched for the both of them. Calvin, now an accountant has marriage problems and is unsatisfied with his work, and he has to team up with Robbie (now Bob Stone) who is working under the CIA in under covering a worldwide chaos.The best thing of Central Intelligence is how Hart and Johnson's chemistry work well on screen. Both of the characters are compelling and well-crafted in their story arcs, and their odd dynamic works as a magic. It’s genuinely funny and surprisingly works as a buddy-comedy. It’s written with significant themes of bullying, marriage and friendship.Where the movie falters is how it blends comedy and crime – of course, the buddy-com formula and spy antics stay, but there’s nothing anymore new on it.VERDICT: Central Intelligence heavily relies on to the dynamic chemistry of Hart and Johnson, even they couldn't imagine."

1225,tideland-movie,DTG.,8, It's a hard movie to recommend to anyone but I really liked the movie. It's difficult to watch and sometimes very disturbing but there is something very worthwhile there. In the end it is a hopeful movie and the main character gets put through a lot but is always treated tenderly.
1226,across-the-universe-movie,KayteM.,3," This looks like, and has about as much depth as, a (bad) film-school music-video. It lacks depth and heart, and tries so hard to fit Beatles lyrics in as dialogue that everything comes across as stilted and painful. Bono's cameo is almost unbearably dreadful. The three rating is given only because hey, it's the Beatles, and it does have its (very occasional) moments of being actually quite visuall arresting, and Jim Sturgess is, quite surprisingly, a pleasure to watch. Otherwise, to be avoided/to be run away from."

I never minded the narration in the original (never thought it was bad), but I did not miss it, here. This was my first time seeing it on a big screen and it is still visually inspired, and has aged well."
1228,iron-man-2-movie,DarkCritic,8,"Iron Man 2 is a very good superhero film. The action scenes are pretty awesome,the story gets very well,but for my letdown size is that it gets too much corky scenes and it has dumbest dialogues for getting over the top. Mickey Rourke was so awesome as Whiplash,that will be my favorite villain in my top. Scarlett Johansson was awesome as Black Widow and she's kind of hot in the way,but far the hottest marvel chick ever! Don Cheadle did good,but the same person like Terrence Howard does,but I prefer Howard better. Robert Downey Jr. plays very good,but not much as good since the first one. I've just seen him every scene that gets more dumber and to be so stupid in the way and like I said it's more over the top and even gets weirder. So I really like this movie,but I heart times that I love is the first Iron Man movie that I always love to watch. But enjoy,not bad but in the good way."

1230,pulse-2005-movie,KurtC.,7, It wasn't so much scary as it was chilling. It brings a fresh viewpoint to the thriller genre that certainly makes you rethink just how dependent we are getting on instant communication. The cinematography is more mood-setting than eerie. Kristin Bell did an excellent job in her first movie roll. I'm looking for to more from her.
1231,battle-of-the-year-movie,Kadeemluvmusic,0,"Chris Brown should've make a Stomp the Yard sequel with this crap. Battle of the Year is far from dead, but the movie is killing us in the dance movie genre. I love Josh Holloway from Lost, but who in the hell did they sign him up in the movie?  This is a Step Up rip-off. If anybody that could teach incredible moves like this, it would have to be Michael Jackson. Bottom Line: Save it for the Razzies because this film is a dud."

Outdated and cheap looking CGI environments, characters and battle scenes. An awful romance subplot.Lucas made some bad choices when making this film but the worst was giving Yoda and lightsaber and having him fight in a duel. The CGI fighting looked really bad and it overall ruined the wise and mystical character of Yoda from the Empire Strikes Back and turned him into some bulls action hero."
1234,madagascar-movie,Happymonk,8,"A fun movie. It's quite funny, the plot's all right and it's well voiced. It's not as good as Shrek, or anything Pixar have made but it is one of the better Dreamworks films. Falls short of greatness due to the fact that it is now starting to show it's age, which is a shame."
1235,hanna-movie,Bama72,3,"This would have been a good film if it had only lasted about 30 minutes.  Since the story could not sustain more than that, filler time was added under the guise of scenery and cultural shots.  It reminded me of the movies of the 50's where there always had to be scenes of native dances and songs, that got really old after a while.  The bad thing was, the movie was just good enough to make me stay to the end.  Also, at about mid point of the movie I knew exactly, and I mean exactly, how the movie was going to play out.  All in all, pretty bad, although Blanchett did a great job."
1236,star-trek-movie,SusanY.,10," I am a long time fan and know the original Star Trek stories by heart. I was skeptical but went in with an open mind. I do not go to the movies but once a year or less and do not have television anymore, but I have seen this movie four times and will see it once more before it leaves the theaters. I loved it that much! Although there were things that definitely bothered me, especially the first time seeing it, it was well done, consistently fast paced, with a great selection of actors to carry on the tradition, especially Jacob Kogan as the child Spock, and Karl Urban as ""Bones (fantastic performance), and Zachary Quinto as Spock (very impressive and a great Spock, except for his nose). Things that did bother me that I wish they had paid more attention to, were Kirk's eyes being blue instead of brown (especially with all the close ups couldn't they have use colored contacts?), the age of Pike at this time should have been younger (even though i liked the actor and his performance), the age of Spock's mother (which at this time of his life should have been a little younger looking, though Winona Rider did an excellent job) and the casting of Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Scotty (Simon Pegg) were very disappointing. They were too different in character than the originals. Too bad James Doohan isn't still with us to assist. His Scotty was more serious, intelligent about it all and endearing. Uhura was ok, but the original was beautiful but didn't ""know"" it; the new one (Zoe Saldana) was too aware of her looks, but the scenes with Spock were touching and well done. Sulu was a good cast. Great family film. If there are sequels, I hope they don't go overboard as the producers of Pirates of the Carribean did, but keep it pure, clean, fast action-paced keeping respect for the original intact and as Spock would say ""logical""."

Tim Burton's movie are odd ( and could give kids nightmares like Corpes Bride , The Nightmare Before Christmas ). But i have to say the way he presents his movies in a whole new World ( Charlie &amp;  Chocolate Factory , Alice In Wonderland ) But there realistic and wonderful and Beetle Juice is the example of a real horrific world with  Batman's Micheal Keaton , Alec Baldwin , Geena Davis. Grade A+"
1238,your-name-movie,keanex,8,"I've never seen a movie by this studio, to be honest in terms of Japanese animation I've not seen much, mostly Ghibli. I saw that this was getting huge praise so I had to check it out. I think that the beginning was a bit confusing, but by the end I was enamored with the unique tale between two people tied together across time. It was a great movie."
1239,frozen-2013-movie,YellowKirby,7,"Okay, I'd precisely give this about a 68/100, but since that isn't an option I'll just go 7. The movie isn't very original, and the music is overrated, but the animation is wonderful to look at, it's colourful, and there are likeable characters, especially Olaf the snowman. Although not as good as many people say, Frozen is still enjoyable and fun for kids."

1242,twilight-movie,AmyC,1," The writer obviously didn't think about the affect her writing, let alone her movie, would cause her reader/watchers. Her vampires were so obvious. They didn't try to mix, they stayed as a group. Everyone loves Bella the moment they see her. She has a vampire watching her sleep, which is considered romantic. Her vampires sparkle. The only reason I'm giving it a 1 is because James was a decent vampire."
1243,run-jump-movie,Lyn,3,"Perhaps I expected too much after seeing Will Forte in ""Nebraska"" -- amid all the tremendous acting and great characters in that movie, he was the winsome heart of it. In this one, his presence barely registers. He heard about this guy who had a stroke (we don't know how), he decides to chronicle the case for posterity (we don't know why) and he lives with the family while making his observations (we don't know what). I agree with the reviewer who said that the fascinating issue of how to love someone who's fundamentally changed by stroke goes largely unexplored. The lead actress, who looks like Julianne Moore, is appealing, if hard to believe. (Family's shattered and yet she dances while doing housework. Huh?)"
1244,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,Geahk,2,"It's exactly what I expected. Abrams is a SAFE director. He's not an auteur. He's not going to make anything bad or great, just, good. Fine. Serviceable. Adequate. I guess I have to admit I find it very disappointing on one hand and exactly what I knew would happen on the other. Abrams just isn't that talented. He's good enough to make something people don't hate but not good enough to make something special and where my disappointment comes in is that the worst kind of film for me is the forgettable one. Say what you will about the Prequels but you will never forget them. They are so terrible they are burned into most people's memory despite their best efforts to drink the pain away. Empire Strikes Back is one of the greatest movies ever made. Even Jedi is memorable whether you like killer teddy bears or not! My expectation and sadness for this film is it will be like Star Trek 2009 in a few years. Everyone will agree they enjoyed it at the time but you won't be able to get anyone to talk about specifics. Because no one actually remembers what happened in Star Trek 2009. It was fun and pretty and empty. It was low-calorie and good enough to not leave a bad after-taste but not good enough to add to any ""best films list."" I wanted Star Wars to be a GREAT film but as soon as Abrams was picked to do it I knew I wouldn't get that. Abrams was the SAFE choice and safe is forgettable.﻿ It's as if Abrams makes films like Chinese food. You forget them in an hour. They are fun and sparkly and bright while you are watching them but they are like the flashy thing in Men In Black. They make you forget. I also write. And while I don't claim to be the best storyteller in the world I have written four plays and several short films and a  of short fiction. I spend considerable thought on why a story works or doesn't. I don't want to spend forever writing about every detail that didn't work but I'll touch on basic points on why Abrams' films are forgettable. 1. All action, no breaksAbrams doesn't understand pacing. He likes to pack his films with action constantly and never have down time. The problem with this is it's the down time where the audiences processes what they just saw and it stores in long-term memory. All action, no breaks means very little gets moved from your short-term memory to your long-term memory. 2. Cartoon charactersAbrams doesn't understand characters. He understands cliché. He creates characters on templates that are only relateable because you recognize the tropes. This is particularly evident in his own (non-franchise) work. Quick, describe any character from Cloverfield! I'll bet you can't even remember anyone except Hud, and only because his name is repeated a thousand times. 3. Glitz over depthAbrams doesn't understand themes or subtext. He is incapable of making The Godfather or Apocalypse Now because everything is on the surface. He likes shiny things. He's an ADHD director. He explores nothing below the most shallow aspects of the characters and world. The reason the original Trilogy is so memorable is because it contains all these important, subtle elements to storytelling. It gives you slow moments after the action to pause and reflect. During these moments it builds subtle characterizations that expand and illuminate the characters thought process and motivations. Through this themes are built and built upon as the story progresses. Most of what you probably remember from the OT is not the space battles, explosions or even lightsaber duels. You don't remember the Death Star blowing up as much as you remember ""Use the force, Luke."" It's because everything in the script carefully crafted that moment for you. It is the arc from idiot farm-boy, to frustrated, brat, to being humbled and grieving on the threshold of manhood, losing again, falling in love, learning to seek deeper and that his own concerns are insignificant in the larger galaxy. You see that bumbling brat progress from annoying to interesting through loss and determination. He is given nothing but must earn it. We see so little development in TFA. Poe might get interesting but he barely was on screen. Finn had the largest arc, going from coward to standing up but he wasn't fleshed out beyond the cartoon. Han and Leia are both regressed. and, Rey, the worst of all never had a floor to start from and had no progress to make. Thank goodness Daisy Ridley is such a good actress because there was nothing to work with there. Any lesser actor could not have pulled that off. The fact is, I could write an entire book on why TFA didn't work. Why ""safe by committee"" is a terrible way to make art. Let's hope that Episode VIII is more original."
1245,jerry-maguire-movie,ydnar4,9,"Jerry Maquire is an essential film for everyone and is one of the most ideal date movies out there with a sports side for the males and some romance for the females. Cameron Crowe's direction is incredible as his films often are and the film boasts several good performances. Tom Cruise takes another break from the action films that made him famous to do a fun, heart warming film. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the role of his career and is the true standout in the film and then there is the beautiful Renee Zellweger who manages to deliver one of  her most notable roles as well. Jerry Maguire avoids all the romantic comedy clichés which Cameron Crowe is also great at and serves as a building block for Crowe's magnum opus Almost Famous later on in his career."
1246,the-thin-red-line-movie,TelorandF,1," Quite possibly the worst waste of three hours I have experienced. I rarely knew who I was looking at, as the soldiers all looked the same, and even more seldom was the feeling that I should care about them. The voice-over-narrators all sounded the same, all spouting a similar, formulaic monologue to the effect of, ""Who am I? Why are we fighting? Where do thoughts come from?"" When I wasn't bored with the monologue, I was engulfed in a score that lacked any power and swelled when it should have been silent or was silent when it should have swelled. In fact, the characters had no dynamics either. They all acted like scared little boys, both the experienced and those whose first war this was, and it is a wonder they weren't all killed by the Japanese. That would have been impossible, however, as the Japanese were inept at shooting just about everything, not to mention they seemed to enjoy running over the hill towards the enemy, shouting instead of taking up positions and shooting. One shining example of this is when the Americans take Hill 210 and run into the main encampment of the Japanese, much to their surprise. The clearly outnumbered Americans then slaughter nearly every Japanese they can point their gun at while the Japanese simply decide it is better to run away than pick up their guns and fight. This film is misguided and sporadic, having only a vague plot, obscure goals, little to no characterization, and a pace so slow there is time to formulate your own cliche ponderings on life."

I watched this movie opening night with the expectation of it holding the bar set by the first one. Coming out of the theatre I realised I'd experienced a much different movie from the first, a much darker and more character driven movie. Oddly enough I also find myself disagreeing with those who think this movie is funnier. I enjoyed this movie, and hold it up to par with the first: a moodier atmosphere, deeper characters, and a step away from typical romanticism and cheesy lines, all of which play to my preferences. Worth seeing if you have an open mind, dont expect every inch of novelty the first one had (it is the same series after all), and are willing to give the characters some room to grow. Final thoughts: Yes it is noticably long &amp; Davy Jones' is incredible: flawless animation and excellent acting seemlessly combined."
1259,aquarius-movie,alexdamaceno,9,"Here in Brazil we're used to separate ""movies"" from ""Brazilian movies"" - because of our ongoing struggle with low quality productions and all its cliches. In most cases, the comedies are often silly and an extension of our unfunny TV productions. And dramas usually portrays either violence at the favelas or some sad, also violent story, taking place at a very poor part of our northeast area. ""Aquarius"" throws away all these cliches and it's just a great movie, period. Not a great Brazilian movie, but a great universal movie, telling a very compelling story about our society as a whole, with all its characteristics and, mostly, its flaws. And in its core it's a story about how part of our elite usually behaves and how the other part (who doesn't care about being elite) reacts."
1260,horrible-bosses-movie,Finnatic,7,"Horrible Bosses is a sort of modern day remake of 9 to 5 by way of Superbad.  I honor this film for the several laughs that it got out of me, but by the end, I found myself ready to move on to something with more lofty comedic goals.  Easily worth your matinee admission price, but be a bit cautious if you are considering paying full evening admission price on this movie.  This is the kind of movie that Saturday night cable premieres were made for, in my opinion."
1261,speed-racer-movie,Lyell,1, Sneek preview was awful. Can they fix it before wide release. Almost comically bad. Lots to make fun of. You might want to go high.
1262,the-great-gatsby-movie,Punkmail,2,"I've read the book and absolutely hated this movie. its just some over-polished, badly paced, and poorly acted piece of trash. i couldn't  care less about the characters, they all felt so disconnected to the movie, they all felt sooo fake. and what about those party scenes where everybody just spontaneously spazzes out to some ""hip tuuunes"" that did nothing but SUCK. all this combined spiraled this movie into an unbearable 2h cfest"
1263,the-expendables-movie,seifer,0,"I can't rate this, it's pointless and i can't say good or bad cause I'll get mauled for it... So there is no chance i am going to say just how bad this movie is!"

1265,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Tehvendon,10,"Had to login to rate the movie a 10 because of all the trolls rating the movie negatively. GG Metacritic. Anyone rating this movie below a 7 shouldn't be allowed on this website, obvious trolls or people that should stop watching movies. The Last Jedi was amazing and even better than 7, it's hilarious to see all of the people that try so hard to give the movie a bad wrap when they have no idea what they are even talking about."
1266,in-the-loop-movie,JohnC.,1," If profanity is the only way to express humor then this movie has it; personally I like a movie with less profanity, more plot, and one that doesn't leave you with the desire that the movie would end soon!"
1267,elysium-movie,Raygirl,7,"Actually, I'd give this a 6.5 because it's got a few too many problems to be a solid 7 IMO.  While Damon is the best part of the movie (he was GREAT), there just wasn't enough Elysium life-style development (I was curious as to the details of how the habitat worked and what they did, but nothing was ever shown except for women lying by pools with their butler robots).  The only part of Elysium that was developed was the defense side, in which Jodi Foster was miscast, IMO.  She is a great actress but her in this role didn't feel right to me.  By the same token, not much was devoted to life on earth and how society operated in the future there either.  Lots of people running around looking poor, sick and dirty, but nothing much about how they survived.  TONS of action though, so I am guessing the guys will like this movie a lot.  But for me, it left too much out in favor of all the action."
1268,insidious-chapter-3-movie,dadoctormav,1,"The Further? Again? Yes its a prequel but can't they introduce a new environment where these demons came from, perhaps another portal? Fresh ideas please."
1269,anomalisa-movie,CriticFer,8,"One of the reasons I went to see Anomalisa is that: 1 The critics worshiped him and academies the nominating for best animated film and 2- His story is more for adults, so the saw and liked. It was not a masterpiece, it was not the best animated film but is possibly the best movie of Kaufman. The only problem is I did not understand because Michael Stone in a scene drops the part that holds the mouth of the doll. That's not realistic, that's pretty rare. The rest not much to tell. I liked the characters, the drama I liked, I loved the character design and I laughed too withthe voice of other characters. Micheal Stone is someone who really looks like human unlike others. After all, Anomalisa is not the best animated film (in my opinion Shaun the Sheep Movie is), but a good adult film and shows that animation can not only be just for kids (there are insults and long sex scene ). I would say that is the best I received this year and I think adults can enjoy. It's just not felt like a masterpiece as the critics say."
1270,the-oogieloves-in-the-big-balloon-adventure-movie,MegWhiteley,0,"Awful movie, is really terrible and stupid, don't have any good. The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure is a fail, stupid, silly and awful movie, no more."
1271,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,ablaze,0,"THE worst Star Wars movie, it felt more like Guardians of the Galaxy clashed with Harry Potter in Star Wars costumes.Critical reviewers must have been bought off by Disney, practices from the gaming industry coming to cinema.The only thing it did well was look good for the sake of looking good (Salt planet, Snoke's chambers).This will be the last Star Wars movie I will be seeing on the big screen."
1272,killers-movie,IvanO,2," Ashton kutcher fails as an action star, the movie itself is really corny and moronic, the movie had its few funny moments and thats because of Rob riggle, nothing else is funny here."
1273,cars-movie,WayzieW.,2," It's difficult to empathize with a cocky plastic red race car. The storyline is very predictible and while the twists and turns are scenic, the movie feels a bit like taking grandma for a drive -- you have to be sure to stay on the main roads so as not to jostle her. It ends up being a familiar trip and halfway through you'll wish you were on a roadtrip with a cooler and more off-beat group of people."
1274,the-mist-movie,TheWileyG.,0," Best feel-good comedy ever! Pity that because I definitely don't think that was the angle they were going for! The crazy religious nut was laughable (to see other reviews trying to get her notimated for an Oscar actually makes me feel ill). As far as special effects go, I have to say that nothing (and I mean nothing) lives up to the real thing. Why does every alien creature these days have that plasticy glaze? The casting agent obviously had one thing on their mind when they embarked upon their only task, and that was probably something like 'two expressions max guys. Ok so, eyebrows up, eyebrows down - you're hired! But maybe practice the eyebrows up for a bit before we start'. I heard rumours of a political undertone - and yeah, I suppose there was one but for crying out loud. Things just wouldn't get that out of control in the space of 3 days. The human race has come a long way...we know how to survive - it's like an in-built mechanism triggered by life threatening events. Many horror films play on this, and they can do it well, evoking our very senses, making us believe in the characters because they do the things that we'd do ourselves. That's how you build characters. Not by jamming a load of brief interpersonal meetings into 3 minute slots one after the other! Oh the amount of times I had to turn to my boyfriend and say 'cut the rope' 'leave him to die' 'get in the bloody car' which was all in good fun but you'd want to be a complete drone to enjoy this movie. The ending is not by any means harrowing - but it will have you in stitches - just wait til the desperate screaming part, you won't be disappointed! I'm mystified (potential pun here?) as to why this film is getting good reviews. If you read this and choose to ignore it, can I just say 'told ya so!'...you've been warned. Bring a laughter buddy and lots of popcorn to keep you awake. I'm scared of a lotta things, but mist isn't one of 'em...and if I had been there I would have just locked that mental religious lady in the toilet with her portable mini-bible to keep her busy. She'd shut up eventually. Also, guns don't solve everything...you'd think the Americans would know that by now. And if you're driving for ages and you think you might possibly run outta fuel, just ditch your car and get in another one. Duh! I shudder. Go see 'Wanted' instead...James McAvoy is a total hottie."
1275,godzilla-2014-movie,Gurolge,7,"For fans it might be a disappointing movie because the movie seems to enjoy showing Godzilla for a few minutes and taking him away when you expect him to fight with the other monster. I get that - also terrible acting by the lead and the guy that you get to connect with dies after 15 minutes. However if you did not have orgasms about the movie before you saw it or if you have never hear of Godzilla before, it is a good monster movie - keeps the suspense till the last minute and pretty nice effects and brutal killing. This might be a franchise starter unlike the 90s hollywood version which sucked. Also liked the ancient apex predator thing, it is a small thing but a very smart way to make the experience more relatable and realistic. This movie is like the Man of Steel of the Superman franchise; it is there to divide audience into two groups almost equal in size, it certainly has cool destruction scenes and the tone of a thriller. I generally liked it but I doubt that I would watch it again if somehow it gets streamed on television sometime later."
1276,enemy-movie,Meth-dude,8,"The cinematography was superb, the acting was amazing and the movie was interesting and unpredictable.Enemy definitely is a movie you should not miss."
1277,transformers-movie,KyleT,10," Aside from the boring first half of the movie and the human cast that we don't really care about, Transformers is shown exactly the way it should be. This is the definitive moment in Transformers history, and it is no doubt the most fun movie to watch in 2007. Hopefully, Bay makes TF 2better, though."
1278,spy-movie,BarneyOnMT,9,"WHAT I LIKED: A brilliant A-List cast sparkle in one of the best written comedies in a long time. This spy spoof excels in making a story for you to genuinely get into with some badass action to match, that somehow still manages to keep you laughing throughout. It's paced excellently, keeping the audience on a joy ride from the off; this is not only one of the best spy spoofs ever, it's one of the best comedies tooWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It doesn't necessarily shine out from it's genre, being fairly predictable, but what it does it does bestVERDICT: Hands down hilarious and laugh-out-loud funny, 'Spy' is the perfect package for a fun, thrilling, family film that you can really get into."
1279,skyfall-movie,Ali_Marashian,8,"It was the first Bond film I've seen and one of their really best. there are so positive points about this movie which we all already now. but some times it was just predictable(we all knew the bad guy was gonna be killed with the knife, old idea) but there are some drama sketches which I really liked. forget M and his bad son(!) I liked the woman character who helped James Bond to try to kill her boss ( The scene where James was guessing her past was an all-timer and her acting was just great). again, It was a very good movie. It's not a kind- hearted movie which you would smile when you think about it later ( such as Amelie,  Boyhood, ...) but still It's an astonishing achievement. By the way I don't care about the action scenes, that's why I didn't give it a 10!"
1280,the-x-files-i-want-to-believe-movie,PatC.,0," I found more pleasure in counting the little lights running up the isle of the theatre. This movie was gruesome and boring. If Molder and Skully had been killed off in this movie, I think we all would have cheered at the end. If this movie was supposed to make us ""believe"" they were romantically involved, it was more like watching a brother and sister kiss. Sickening and no chemistry between them through out the movie. Keep your money ! ! The story sucks. The most exciting scene was a foot chase for God sake with some hyped up music."
1281,the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn---part-2-movie,BrianMcCritic,3,The first half of this film maybe the worst in the franchise.  Between the CGI baby and continuing the the terrible storyline from part 1 it looked like it was headed for a 0 or 1.  Once the girl grows up and the story changes more towards the battle the 2nd half became the best of the franchise.  Overall I found the ending to be poor and hopefully we've seen the end of this franchise.
1282,hillarys-america-the-secret-history-of-the-democratic-party-movie,asssddddddfdsda,10,"really amazing, I loved it! Shows her faults and lets you decide who you want to vote for and doesnt push it on you, its a great movie I recommend its so great"

1284,mulholland-dr-movie,supa_man94,1,"This movie is just a load of complete nonsense. There are 3 or 4 plots intertwined which seem to have absolutely no relation with each other until the very underwhelming ""twist"" at the end, which ultimately left me with a a frustrated feeling because I felt that none of my questions were really truly answered. Another thing that left me frustrated was the fact that the movie barely gave the audience enough to deduce what was going on, it was as if the writers wanted us to just guess what happened in more than half the movie. On the good side, at least the acting was decent. At the end of the day, you just feel like you wasted 2 hours of your life watching a movie that just tries too hard and over-complicates everything. Thanks David Lynch, but no thanks, I'll stick with ""Memento""."
1285,american-history-x-movie,googolendtimes,9,"""American History X"" is immensely relevant to modern audiences, perhaps now more than ever. A gritty and provocative drama that puts in graphic terms the dangers of racism and hatred, propelled to greatness by Edward Norton's mesmerising and powerful performance and his interplay with Edward Furlong is one of the most affecting pairings in film. And the ending is shattering no matter how many times it's watched."
1286,the-avengers-2012-movie,darkcerb,10,"The best super hero movie I've yet seen and a damn fine action flick with some genuine humor and touches of heart, a must see. I can well understand the complaints as to the story it's not Shakespeare but does anyone expect it to be? It's story suits it perfectly however and had me at least wanting to see even if I already guessed what would happen next. A must see."
1287,when-in-rome-movie,RegOz,9,"I loved it! and I disagree with this movie's critics...in generall I will never understand most of the critics (especially the ones of Rotten Tomatoes!) . For example, critics often give many starts to comedies that are gruesome, raw and abbuse of sexual imagery (e.g There's Is Something About Mary) while they disregard romantic comedies. 'When in Rome' is engaging, sweet, yet a cool movie. It never gets tacky or overly emotional/corney. Seeing this movie was like a refreshing breeze! . If you are trying to find realism in comedies, you are not always going to find it and you may get disappointed with this. The purpose of a comedy is making you laugh, and in order to do so, the resources that producers/directors/writers use are very diverse and those may include 'fairy tale' sort of fantasy! At the end,what is important is that you enjoy it . The plot of this movie is a bit 'Disney-like' so even your children-in you have them- may enjoy it. But remember, this movie is not there to teach you anything, nor is it there to be trascendental, for is just a comedy; thus, is just about having a good time. So watch it with an open mind and an open heart...and forget about critics (their opinions are, after all, subjective) and remember, just because it is romantic it doesn't mean is bad!!! Finally, if you see it positively come and share it here! The movie needs it!"
1288,the-greatest-showman-movie,Poor_Leno,8,"Good film, zendaya is good looking, didn't know it was a musical before seeing it but I like musicals so that's cool!"
1289,logan-lucky-movie,KalebKoho,8,"Logan Lucky is a hilarious, fun-filled time with characters that are an absolute blast to be around. Daniel Craig turns in his best performance outside of the 007 franchise and Steven Soderbergh proves why he's the king of heist films."
1290,bad-boys-ii-movie,rdavies,2,"Will Smith is good. Martin Lawrence is mehh. The first one was bad enough, and this was like that but with more/worse action scenes and a frustrating story. I didn't like."
1291,old-dogs-movie,Compi24,3,"So cheap, tired, and stale that even its two likable lead actors can't save it."
1292,ghostbusters-2016-movie,ALtheKiller86,3,"Not trying to jump onto the hate bandwagon here, but this is seriously one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. Cringe worthy and nearly unwatchable. A barbaric mishandling of a franchise. And it has nothing to do with the gender of the cast, but everything to do with the director/producer/screenwriters. The reviews that say 'Oh its not the bad' or 'Give it a chance, its pretty good' are completely out of touch. It's sad really. Hopefully the reboot the franchise again, go back to doing a sequel/canon continuation and GIVE IT TO A DIFFERENT FILMMAKER!!! The only other option is to just let it die. This film is soooooo bad, I'm kinda leaning towards the ladder. PROS:-the 3D is pretty good-the music score is okay.-Chris Hemsworth is hilarious, albeit completely inappropriate and out of context for this kind of film CONS:-literally everything else!! In closing...this film is horrid and quite possibly the worst film of 2016. Avoid. If you're dying of curiosity, wait until Netflix or Redbox. Seriously. Save your money. It's not worth it."
1293,the-lord-of-the-rings-the-return-of-the-king-movie,LOTRfan,10,"Magnificent film. The best movie of 21st century so far. I call The Lord Of The Rings trilogy as The Godfather in Fantasy genre. When you see it, you will love it. You can get anything from this film. Love, epic, friendship, sadness and etc. My favorite film of all time!"
1294,district-9-movie,BillR,2, This is a dramamine movie. Anyone who gets motion sickness beware because the hand held camera technique will carry you through maybe twenty minutes of the movie before you have to head for the door. For the short length of time I could stand the show I enjoyed it but the cinematagraphy was nauseating. Beware if you get motion sickness.
1295,green-lantern-movie,ExKing,2,why would anyone think that this is a good movie idea is beyond me  even so the Execution is ridiculous  how can someone is Exposed to something that can travel him anywhere in the universe never act surprised  like it was happening to him his entire life  this movie don't make any sense in the slightest.
1296,in-bruges-movie,MorganC.,10," Absolutely brilliant filmmaking, cleverly written with beautiful cinematography. The end is a bit much to stomach, but completely appropriate and fitting."
1297,deadpool-2-movie,Hourless,9,"Fantastic and Hilarious. The start of the film was gold and set the wheels in motion for the rest of the film, was a fantastic opening sequence. My local boy Julian Dennison, who starred in perhaps the best NZ film in history 'The Hunt For The Wilderpeople' (I recommend you watch this it's great!), he's from New Zealand and he played as Russell in this film did a great job in his role and has a bright future ahead of him! Don't want to go into detail to much but overall it was much more absurd, rude, hilarious and at times was a tad emotional and serious. FYI: After the movie has finished, I recommend you stay afterwards, you will be pleasantly surprised. =)"
1298,the-frozen-ground-movie,ScottMcKone,2,"There's really no excuse for this film being as bad as it is. Despite tons of on screen talent it's destroyed by poor story telling and paper thin characters. With this subject matter and being based in reality it should be a story that grabs and never lets go. Unfortunately someone feels that shaking the camera is all it takes to hold an audience. The script is wordy to the point of dull and the concept of pacing is non existent. All in all, just a truly poorly executed film. My biggest movie let down so far this year."
1299,sucker-punch-movie,FilipeNeto,3,"When I started watching this movie I was expecting something different than it actually was. However, I don't feel disillusioned with it because I've had very low expectations. The whole story revolves around a girl (we never know her real name but only a nickname, Baby Doll) who is hospitalized in an asylum after trying to protect her younger sister from a dangerous stepfather (responsible for their mother's death and eager to lay hands on their money). Unfortunately, the shot hits the sister and not the stepfather, who bribes the director of an asylum to lobotomize her, which would make her forget everything, nullifying her personality. From here, the film is lost as it enters a parallel universe, imagined by the girl in order to escape her own reality. The asylum ceases to be a madhouse to become into a clandestine brothel for very rich clients, and where she is forced to dance seductively. With each dance, however, she more deeply imagines surreal worlds of fighting, avoiding facing real life and feeding the dream of escaping.Visually, the film is very good: high doses of good quality CGI, great cinematography with good framing and some very original camera shots, good sets, consistent and well-crafted costumes. But this isn't enough to make a good movie if we consider cinema's the art of telling a story through images, words and gestures. The script is the biggest flaw in the film: almost everything it shows is imagined inside the head of the main character, but the audience doesn't quite understand the reason that led her to such a mental escape. There is also no effort to articulate this with what happens to the character in real life. We are simply disassociated from reality, and this makes the film complicated to understand. Another problem is the lack of originality in the script, which randomly blends a huge range of influences, copied or reinvented from dozens of other films and series, such as ""Harry Potter"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Twillight Zone"", ""Charlie's Angels"", ""Kill Bill"", ""Naruto"", ""Dragon Ball"" etc. And everything gets worse when we see theatrical and stylized fighting scenes, clearly inspired by Japanese anime. The way the movie tries to be sexy without getting it is also unpleasant. Emily Browning is the best actress that the film presents, and her character is the one that is properly developed, but she's far from what I would call a sexy woman, and a blonde wig (looks like a cosplay) and a short skirt aren't enough to change that. At that point, she loses to the supporting cast, who compensate some lack of talent with more curvaceous bodies. The soundtrack is good, as it's consistent with the film's retro and punk environment, appearing at the right times and knowing how to disappear when its not needed."
1300,bad-moms-movie,mge,2,"A movie that emphasizes the terrible way people are raising their kids by pandering to their every need, doing their homework, and creating spoiled, self-centered, helpless people. In theory this should be a good movie, great cast, but uses the same ""bad"" behavior for cheap laughs that every other ""bad"" movie uses. The plot and setting are a painful reinforcement of gender stereotypes, with moms that do everything, even their kids homework. In 2016 this shouldn't even be being made and it is completely offensive that the child says she won't get into ivy league and will have to become a ""teacher"". Can see how they really value education by the clever and witty plot and multi-dimensional characters, oh wait, they don't have those."
1301,dan-in-real-life-movie,MarkM,1," I can't get over how horrible this movie was. There's a couple of scenes where Steve Carell's comic persona rises to the surface, but I spent the entire time wishing that someone would come in and arrest all these obnoxious characters. This is a painful movie to watch."
1302,hot-rod-movie,Meth-dude,8,"The movie made no sense, it was unbelievable, predictable and cliché and cheesy, but it made fun of itself, the acting was good, it was funny and it was entertaining. Hot Rod was a pleasant surprise and a good comedy."
1303,a-night-at-the-roxbury-movie,nickd,0,Annoying and unfunny. I forced myself to watch all of it to make sure I didn't miss anything. I'll never understand why this film gets so much praise.
1304,morning-glory-movie,conschobhar,3,"Though this film has its heart in the right place, it is extremely irritating at times and often simply un-funny.  Highlights: Ford's deadpan, it's message work can be pleasurable in itself. Lowpoints: Keaton not being put to better use, the romantic sub-plot's utter lack of sexiness."
1305,big-hero-6-movie,sonic4president,10,"Since I was so disappointed by Frozen, I was hoping Disney would step up their game for this film. After I saw the first 30 seconds of the film, I knew it was going to be amazing. The action never ends and the cast features a large range of loveable characters. You'll come across some sad moments but as a whole this is one of the best animated films in years!"
1306,1114-movie,Rob,8," A very clever film that blends the styles of Irreversible, Crash and Memento to tell a story that is anything but simple."
1307,antichrist-movie,LetzTalkMoveez,1,"Von Trier goes to great lengths in ""Antichrist"" to shock, frighten, and speak upon the devolution of marriage due to tragedy. Great, but give it to someone else. Pretentious, silly, vapid, and truly boring."
1308,riddick-movie,quincytheodore,7,"In a throwback to Pitch Black lore, Riddick regains some of its sci-fi tension and although is not as incredibly colossal as some action movie recently, it's a decent action thrill with proven traditional approach. Once again Riddick finds himself in a strange realm chased by hunters, both humans and beasts. The premise is set so similarly after Pitch Black, down to some of its stereotypical characters, I couldn't help the surging feel of deja vu as I watched it. The simpler theme, for most and better part, works well for dark action Riddick is known for. Vin Diesel returns to his old fugitive character after a while, it's a good direction not to portray Riddick as constantly overwhelmingly hero. He's vulnerable at some points and relies on his predatory stealth skill instead of sheer brute force. The highlights of the movie is when he tinkers with the mercenaries and outwits them with trickery. He is presentable as hazard to other human beings and built like the part as well. However, the acting might stumble a bit as Riddick barely registers emotion aside from taunting grin or low pitch grunt. As for the incoming threat of monsters, it may be hit-and-miss. These creatures don't have the presence of the old photophobia beasts from Pitch Black, and appearance-wise a bit too generic. CG for them is acceptable, especially for the space dog for Riddick's companion. Action goes smoothly even if there are segments that look awkward. The use of lightning and color dye fit the atmosphere of dry hostile planet, scenes in the dark are meticulously done as they are still coherent and focused. I personally dislike the habit it does with shining the flashlight straight into the audience though. Cast is wildly brash. Most of these characters might be offensive or irritating, as the mercenaries are supposed to, but the script doesn't really help adding personality into them. Everyone is one dimensional as they come, from the erratic merc leader, the more sophisticated merc leader, the usual henchmen merc and one sexy merc. If you have seen the trailer, these people will act as expected as that thirty second shows. For depth and characters, I'd say the original Pitch Black has more likeable ones, at the very least more tolerable. Riddick is old school sci-fi action, it doesn't use flamboyant CG and rightly so, since the appeal is the larger than live legend Riddick has. The ending might slightly underwhelming and it is placed in more niche category compared to the recent Pacific Rim or Star Trek, nevertheless it's still an enjoyable foray to the dark realm which its claims victim one at a time."
1309,beasts-of-the-southern-wild-movie,bgirl,9,"I have never written a review but after seeing Beasts of the Souther Wild, felt compelled to write something.  I am sure the cinephiles have heard the hype about the  movie but to be clear it is totally justified.  It is hard to describe as most say but the best way for me to describe it is a magical, lyrical and visually sumptuous film.  The leading actress, Quvenzhane Wallis, who was only six years old when it was shot, is simply amazing in the role of Hushpuppy.  Probably one of the best child performance I've ever seen.  Academy, please give her the Oscar because I can tell you we will not see a performance like this very often. She completely owns this movie. Dwight Henry also another non-professional actor amazes in his performance.  I understand this movie might  not be for everyone but I suggest take ride and immerse yourself in the Bathtub because it is a very special film."
1310,captain-america-the-first-avenger-movie,nop,7,"Well done action movie, with likeable characters, more or less consistent plot and conservative usage of special effects. Movie with a soul, which Transformers 3 did not have at all. In visual department this movie  borrows heavily from WW2 fantasy action games, such as Wolfenstein. Blue glowing stuff with almost magical properties, desintegrator guns, enemies, environments - definitely not new or original. But copied with taste.Don't expect masterpiece, but for a mainstream comic book film this is as good as you can get."
1311,mulholland-dr-movie,MoviegoerGeek,10," Don't you ever dream? Didn't you ever remember tiny pieces of it and try to make sense out of it all? Didn't you ever mixed people in your dreams YOU KNOW they don't know each other? Maybe you are to heavy on sleeping pills and this is numbing yourselves. This movie not only DOES have perfect sense. It has many layers beyond the dream/reality sequence. It IS a character study (to those morons saying otherwise) of a really ......up star-wannabe. DREAMS reveal more than yourself than you really are able to believe. In the dream sequence, [SPOILERS] there are hints of the guilt Dianne (Betty)experience for having Camille (Rita) killed by the mobster. I'm not doing your homework here: take a further look. DREAMS can also be PREMONITORY (hence the sense of deja-vu we sometimes feel). And Dianne (Betty) sees HER OWN death, only she doesn't know who is the rotted corpse laying in bed (but you can see she FEELS her in her own horrified face). brillant! You peel even further and you realize a ""mirror game"" depicting a symbolic Hollywood vs. Reality irony. In Hollywood (a.k.a Mulholland Dr.) bad actors rings false and are cartoonish (like Betty herself), while the industry IS the mobster, directors are puppets and the STORY is linear. In Reality, bad actors are messed up, the STORY is twisted, and the Industry and directors won't throw you a bone if you worth ..... Peel further enough, and at the core you will find a history of a rejected love who ends up in tragedy (Dianne killing herself). IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU? This is arguably the best film of the new millenium. The most complex and deep (YES, DEEP) and the most visually stunning. A Masterpiece!! Warning: Don't be a Dianne, USE YOUR BRAINS!"

1313,the-avengers-2012-movie,ant0n,8,"Very fun movie to watch. This movie takes the wittiness from Iron Man and throws is into this movie. There really aren't any serious scenes. Everything is just ride filled with action and laughs. The reason this movie won't get anything higher than an 8 from me is because the movie can be too light-hearted for my liking.  When the world is at stake and you have almost every scene ending with a funny line it get's to the point where this movie becomes more of a comedy than an action drama. It's the best Marvel film by far, but the fact that the plot is not very deep keeps it from being more than an 8. I much prefer the take Warner Bros. has taken with Batman because it is more true to life . But if you are a person that doesn't want a movie that takes itself too seriously then you'll enjoy The Avengers."

1315,2012-movie,Chris,2," Wow. It's been a long time since i've paid good money to see a film THIS bad. I'm giving it a couple of points for effects, but they are literally the only thing remotely good about 2012. It's just so... so... dumb. And not dumb in a fun way, just dumb in a dumb way. If it wasn't so loud, I could have happily fallen asleep through it, which would have been a far better use of my time. Ugh. It was so unbelievably bad it actually made me a little angry."
1316,muppets-most-wanted-movie,DukeJon,7,"Very hit and miss. Ricky Gervais is awful. Has he actually ever put in a a funny performance in a Hollywood film? However Tina Fey is excellent as the Gulag guard, as is the Clouseau-inspired French detective. To be honest it's the cameos that make this film. Ironically the muppets are the weakest part of every Muppet movie, in an age of CGI they little more than a nostalgic throwback to simpler times."
1317,anomalisa-movie,moviemitch96,7,"The film's premise was very interesting to me and I'm always interested to see what genius ideas Charlie Kaufman has to serve up to audiences. The result this time around is a thoughtful yet somewhat uneven film that didn't seem too sure of what direction it wanted to go in. What started with a promising first half quickly faded by the time the third act rolled around, which became rather muddled and rushed. On the plus side, David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh as the two lead voice talents felt perfectly cast and fit the model of their characters rather well. Overall, the whole stop-motion idea was an interesting choice and the film's story also had some fun little quirks and ideas to show, but I still can't help but feel like it came up rather short of my expectations, as well as its potential."
1318,cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-movie,[Anonymous],8," I really don't understand the hate for this movie. I rented this to watch with my family, and we were all cracking up at the use of physical comedy and the above-average jokes (especially for a kid's movie). The first 2/3 of the movie were extremely funny, while the last 1/3 changed it's tone to action/adventure. It's a shame the end wasn't more satisfying, but it is still definitely worth seeing."

To start with the beginning when the movie was starting you just stare at the earth for a good 3 minutes which isn't a big deal IF YOU DIDN'T SHOW IT AS MUCH THE REST OF THE MOVIE! I mean it s in almost every frame. Then the debris hits and kills the man that I GUESS we're suppose to feel for because Oh! he's got a picture of his family. You can not throw a sentimental moment when you don't even show the persons back story! Then lets go with the rising action and such  POINT A TO POINT B?! REALLY? Oscar worthy my ass. When you have a story that Does Not Show its just a point A To point B movie THAT'S A GOOD MOVIE. IT TAKES YOU ON AN ADVENTURE NOT DROLL FLOATING! Then the ending was the Worst ever.

Despite that, this film blew me away. Almost everything about this film was great and there are only two reasons I didn't give it a 10. One was because there were moments in the film that I couldn't really appreciate because I was never a fan. But I'm glad they put these moments in because it will be great for the people who are in to it. The second reason was the character Uhura. She's introduced early in the film but after that the only relevant thing she does is kiss Spock and it just seems like the dynamic of the film wouldn't be altered at all if she wasn't there. Other than that, this film is undeniably brilliant."

1336,hidden-movie,PeterT.,8," Thanks to all the former commenters and I don't have a lot more to add you'll be pleased to know. The film had a great atmosphere of mystery and foreboding although the guilt theme seemed a little obvious. However perhaps its about France's guilt about the little problems they've been having recently with their Maghrebian citizens. I liked the way we never quite knew whether what we were experiencing as real life would turn out simply to be part of a narrative by an omniscient author, presenting our life on video - even though it's also yet another example of a film director casting himself as God! The acting was satisfyingly understated, not Hollywood hysterics. Get it out on video - before someone leaves it on your doorstep."
1337,unbroken-movie,DirtyDave,3,"As a fan of uncensored war movies, I went into this one with a positive mindset. That quickly went away after the raft scene. Or scense. That's the problem with this movie is that it acts like it has to little material to work with and lags on for far too long. Yes, we know that they were on the raft and in the camps for a long time. But we don't have to sit with them for every minute they went through to get that across to us.This movie had heart, but was to strung out with not enough excitement for me to recommend."

Add to that the older guy is ""a Jew"" who is rather shady on several levels, and his Jewishness is made a central theme. So we have a pervy older Jew corrupting a beautiful young thing with her parents' blissful encouragement. Please - this is supposed to be charming? It's perverse. Yuch."
1340,dredd-movie,oDjento,9,"Critics totally got it wrong for Dredd. With Stallone's awful portrayal of Judge Dredd before, there was reason to be worried about another Dredd film. Luckily, it turned out one of the best action films of the year. Brutally violent in the best ways possible, with awesome action pumping all the way through the film. The slo-mo drugs adds an ace colourful effect to scenes. Karl Urban nails his role as Dredd with helmet staying on all through the film, being dry and using deadpan humour excellently. Such an underrated movie. So easy to watch with friends over and over again. Dredd 2 pleaaaaeesee soon!"

1342,fracture-movie,MichaelM.,7," Agree with what others have said, great performances, but you could see the 2 major plot twists coming from the next county. Not a big problem for me with this script though, as it was nice to see the ""most likely scenario"" play out without some campy set of extraordinary circumstances being revealed at the last second. Hopkins has the ""genius without a conscience"" character down pat, and perhaps I've just seen it one too many times, so I wasn't overly taken with that performance. However Gosling did pleasantly surprise me, and I found myself vacillating between hoping his character would succeed and wishing for him to fail. He underplayed the requisite moralistic struggle and epiphany scenes just enough to make them part of the movie flow, rather than an all too predicatable sub climax."
1343,watchmen-movie,moviemayhem,7,"n the mid-’80s, writer Alan Moore began to imagine a world in which the superheroes and costumed crime-fighters he’d grown up reading helped shape the Cold War decades that had repeatedly brought humanity to the brink of extinction. It wasn’t a better world. Behind their masks and glowing eyes, the heroes Moore conceived and created with artist Dave Gibbons were hindered, and occasionally crippled, by the same conflicting impulses, childhood traumas, and redirected neuroses that drive everyone else. Moore and Gibbons’ graphic novel Watchmen helped redefine the types of stories superheroes could be used to tell, not just by freighting them with darkness—too many subsequent creators showed how easy that could be—but by weaving their capes and gadgets into a dense, deep narrative: a detective story played out against the apocalypse in a world so thoroughly realized that Charles Dickens would be jealous. The same elements that make Watchmen a great book made a Watchmen film a difficult prospect. (Moore, on principle, removed himself and his name from the project, which probably didn’t help.) It’s remarkable that any Watchmen movie made it to the screen, after the years of false starts and litigation. And the one we got—directed by Zack Snyder, most recently responsible for the ably made, philosophically dubious Frank Miller adaptation 300—deserves credit for staying true to the characters, plot (up to a point), and look of the original material while still generating his own kind of energy. Sometimes that energy feels misapplied and overcranked, as the roar of the action drowns out the film’s human voices, but Snyder’s Watchmen keeps moving so assuredly, it’s nearly impossible not to get swept along. Keeping Moore’s alternate-universe ’80s New York setting, Watchmen opens with the murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a long-serving crime-fighter with a late-career sideline in covert ops. (The film keeps Moore’s dark joke that electing Nixon to multiple terms is one of his world’s problems.) A masked vigilante named Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley)—the only one who didn’t hang up his disguise when the government outlawed civilian crime-fighters in the mid-’70s—launches an investigation and uncovers a much larger conspiracy, one seemingly tied to mounting nuclear tensions between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., as well as a bunch of Rorschach’s old colleagues. These include the Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman), who inherited the title from her mother (Carla Gugino); Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) a bookish, wealthy master of machines; Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), who’s since turned his remarkable intellect to acquiring wealth and power; and Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a lab-accident-created glowing godlike being whose connection to humanity remains an open question. There’s sometimes too much Dr. Manhattan in Snyder’s Watchmen, which often feels like a feat of engineering first, an artistic expression second. But his source material keeps him grounded, as does solid work from Crudup, Wilson, and especially Haley, whose performance evokes pity, fear, sympathy, and revulsion as he goes about his single-minded pursuit of justice without compromise. Others bring less. Given a central role, the lightweight Akerman serves as an    Andie MacDowell-in-Four-Weddings-And-A-Funeral-level distraction, and Snyder isn’t always well-served by his tendency to start at 11 and try to turn up the volume, particularly in a bunch of over-the-top, bone-cracking action scenes. The time spent developing watchmen-fu would have been better invested in not blowing one of the book’s big Mars setpieces, or figuring out a better alternate ending than the one dropped in the original’s place. And yet in the end, the film’s ambitious drive to create a dread-soaked alternate America and people it with flawed, recognizable heroes carries it along. Snyder uses grand gestures to create a sense of world-imperiling doom rooted in another era, but equally at home in this one. But he also remains willing to slow down to capture the gravity of a funeral, or dwell on a moment between old partners patching up a friendship as doomsday approaches. Moore’s touch emphasizes how messed-up and needy comic-book people would have to be to do what they do. Missteps and all, Snyder’s film gets that right, and this as well: When we look up in the sky, we don’t see a bird or a plane, but a mirror."
1344,alien-resurrection-movie,JammyGuyStudios,3,"This movie is hugely over rated. A huge disappointment to fans like me. A just can't really think of many redeeming features about this film! Most of the characters are all stereotypes and this movie has one of the most distasteful attempts at humor ever in it: ""I say we ditch the cripple"" If you haven't guessed by that then most of the dialogue is pretty awful. At least the acting was decent."
1345,the-aviator-movie,worleyjamers,8,"Cate Blanchett is stunning and the cinematography is gorgeous. I strongly dislike Leonardo DiCaprio, though he's okay here; I think he's a highly overrated actor and so I find most of his performances incredibly annoying. With that in mind, I really liked him in The Aviator. This is his movie and he carries the film well. He works well with Scorsese and this film is proof of that."
1346,indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull-movie,SaraH,2," This is Indiana Jones scrubbed free of anything that made it remotely fun- Lucas was concerned about making it too violent, so he ""toned it down."" Translation: it is incredibly lame. Almost anything that was good in it is a rehash of the old movies, which had grit and grime. The film quality is muddy because it was digitally filmed, and the ridiculous plot- complete with aliens and crystal skulls- is laughable.

It's a little Pollyanna-ish of them - considering that we're talking about a horror movie.  If nothing else, this film should make a BIG star out of Teresa Palmer, who has done some excellent work in a lot of ""B"" movies.  She should be stealing some parts from the likes of Jennifer Lawrence in my mind.  The basic story is solid/innovative, but the 3 lead actors really put it over the top."

This one is about the Bondurant Brothers who survived World War 1, Spanish Flu....&amp; selling Moonshine. Probably the best stellar show by Tom Hardy as far his performance is considered after ""Warrior"". Even though LaBeouf was the main lead in the movie, his character was over shadowed by Tom. Never expected LaBeouf to do justice to the role, however he tried to give his best and it was average. The other character which will mesmerize you is 'Rakes'. Because Guy Pearce never disappoints as a baddie. Jason Clarke was decent as a supporting brother to Tom.If you are expecting violence, guns blazing, drama &amp; powerful performances, go for it. You will not be disappointed."

The backdrops look very very realalistic but the characters are very cartoony like they are in every Pixar movie and I like that. I thought the story was just ok. Not great but not bad just great. It is worth checking out but I don't think it stands out next to the other Pixar movies."

1358,the-matrix-movie,VinceRocks123,10,"Loving the action sequences and special effects to this very day, I had my eyes focused on the situation on who is the matrix and how to know what it is from beginning to end, and filled me with lots of questions on reality(but knowing its not true and meant for entertainment) A spectacular thrill ride in the style of a cyber update of Alice in Wonderland, Keeanu Reeves plays Neo, a computer hack who unlocks the secret of the matrix and fines himself thrown into the deep underworld of reality where the discovery that interstellar machines have exploited the human race for generations, is uncovered. Neo is found by the rebellion and their leader Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who believes Neo is the chosen one, and they both set out to survive with freedom in their hands, and the Matrix is sending enemies closing in on them. though it was kind of flawed looking, it is still a great movie that could have been the next star wars hadn't its sequels been so awful other than that one of the most action packed sic-fi fantasies ever shown on the big screen which pill would you choose?"

1363,the-mummy-2017-movie,FreddyLives99,3,"This is a poor start to a new cinematic universe, and I went with low expectations and was still disappointed. There are some well-shot action sequences, and I do like what Universal is going for here, setting up a world where many different monsters coexist, like Cabin in the Woods, but what we get with this are a bunch of tired PG-13 action cliches. Oh, and I should also mention that the film is not scary at all, so that's a fail. Let's talk about the comic relief. Why is it needed? This is the ""Dark Universe"", so the tone should be kept serious, but screenwriters seem to always think that audiences want this, so we have to endure bad joke after bad joke. Of course we get the wise-cracking sidekick who seems to be trying too hard to get a laugh, but all characters get some line that's supposed to be funny but comes off as awkward, and it ruins any suspense that a scene may have been building toward. Humor especially ruined the scene where Tom Cruise wakes up in a body bag after coming back from death. What should have been very dramatic was just supposed to be funny because he woke up naked. PG-13 humor at its finest! Now I'd like to address the flashbacks to The Mummy's origin story. The flashbacks were way overused, and they begin probably no more than ten minutes after we see them originally. This is when I felt that the director thought his audience had very short attention spans and had to be constantly reminded of plot elements throughout the film. Now, as for The Mummy herself, she looks great, has a creative design, but she's hardly menacing like she's supposed to be, and her zombified minions are not much better. She doesn't have a world domination plan like Imotep from the 1999 Mummy franchise, she just wants Ethan Hunt, and that's it. Also, ripping off the face-in-the-sandstorm scene from the '99 movie was so unnecessary, and there wasn't even a good reason for it. If Universal is going to continue with a universe based on horror films, they need to put effort into actually scaring us."
1364,guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie,louisadkins,10,"Extremely, awesomely, epic recommendation.  This is a fun movie, a romp through the universe with an unusual group of characters that find themselves needing to come together for the most unusual (for them) of quests.  A wonderful balance of witty dialogue, excellent special effects, and perfectly paced storytelling, this movie should definitely be seen in-theater.  (IMAX 3D worked out very well.)"

1366,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Riku24692,2,"WARNING: this review contains spoilers.It's  easy task to give a proper review of a Star Wars movie. I think the best way to do so is by considering the movie in 2 different ways. Hence I'll be talking about TLJ as a movie, and second I'll be talking about TLJ as part of the SW legacy. Let's begin with saying that Unfortunately the R. Johnson movie fails to deliver in both of these aspects.TLJ as a MOVIE:Sadly the movie is flowed with several and fatal mistakes.1) THE PACING. This movie is the longest in the franchise (152 min. long), despite of this it totally fails to deliver a smoth crescendo of rythm. Expecially in the first half  TLJ will put the viewer against very long and static senes such as the slow FO-Resistence chase or the Luke-Rei-on-an-island plot. Both of these start way to slow and never begin to grow, untill the last thirty minutes of the movie. The result of this is that TLJ feels way longer then it should be, and that fails to keep the viewer engaged for all its entireness.2) THE HUMOR. Star Wars movies have always been (also) about humor and comic relief characters. TLJ makes absolutely no difference on this behalf. Overall, comic moments are fine, characters like BB-8 or Porgs really manage to snach a smile out of anyone. The real problem lays in the abuse of these moments out of some pivotal scenes that end up with losing all of their charm. Moments like the ""put-something-on"" scene really manages to kill all the spirit and emotional meaning of Rei-Kilo connection. The Poe-Hux gag at the begining of the movie is by far too long and makes both characters look more stupid then they should ever have looked. Even worse, the moment when Rei hands Luke his father's longtime lost lightsaber, the same scene J.J. Abrams perfectly set up at the end of TFA, is completely ruined by Luke sudden reaction to throw it away that completely kills it.3) THE PLOT. For all these, and many other reasons, the plot really struggles to stay together. The script fails to feel meaningful in any moment, the entire 40 min long Canto Bight plot could have simply been removed entirley if only vice-admiral Holdo had bothered to communicate with the rest of the Resistence her plan all togheter. After a too-long part of the plot were Luke refuses to train Rei, he promises her 3 lessons and actually delivers just 2 of them. And the list continues. This feels even worse if you think how rushed senes like the final Luke-Kilo confrontation look.TLJ as part of SW legacy:Sadly is right here that TLJ totally falls apart.All of the old characters are severly belittled. Leia becomes a sort of Wonderwoman-like figure who feels so unconnected to her value as the leader of the Resistence (The leading role for most of the movie is actually taken by vice-admiral Holdo). They wanted to make her look strong in the Force, they just managed to make her feel unapropriate. On this note, I have no idea how they could resolve Leia's character now that Carrie left us, She will probably be even more meaningless in Episode IX.Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C3PO have been reduced to such a little screentime, to make them look just like cameos for fans, that actually important characters to the plot. I strongly got the feeling that Disney is trying to marginalize them for unkown reasons.Even new characters like Rei and Kilo fail to develop. All of Episode VII references to Ren Knights and Rei's Parents have been completely removed from this movies. Emblematic in this sense is Snoke who dies a shameful death and fails to cope with fans expectations on his true identity.By far the worst work was made with Luke. He was the brightest hope of the Galaxy, he was THE JEDI, the man who managed to bring back Vader from the dark side, the man who saw hope and light even where there was almost none. He was reduced to a coward heremit who refuses his place into the galaxy. On this behalf, Johnson looked disrespectful to the lore of SW, failing to convey a meaningful reason for this change, again the scene where he throws the lightsaber felt like a punch in the gut to all of long-time SW fans.Also the Role of the Force of Siths and Jedi have been questioned. Disney is tryin really hard to make the Brand advance into a more ""democratic"" vision of the Force where there are no heroes, just everyday guys who make the right decisions for the people they love (Rose character is emblematic in this sense). The big mistake is rappresented by the way this has been implemented. By simply throwin into the Sarlac's pit 40 years of tradition between the Dark Side and the Brightside. Also this change fails to happen in the movie couse dispite what they say, Rei and Kilo still pretty much fall into the Jedi-Sith stereotype, they just seem not to like it at all.Eventually the transition between Lightsabers to broomsticks at the end of the movie, is not something any fan wanted to see."
1367,john-wick-chapter-2-movie,badgerryan19,8,Great film. I am happy to see that the sequel is better than the original which rarely ever happens. Keanu Reeves shows again that he is devoted as ever to be John Wick and it shows. The action scenes were as good as ever. I really like that they really had a story this time and they really shows you how the assassin/mafia business really works. But I do believe it was missing just something to bring it to amazing level. With that said go see John Wick 2.
1368,eragon-movie,MichaelU.,3," To me, Eragon is one of the best books i ever read, so when i heard they were making a movie, I was extremely excited. But after i saw it, I nearly puked at how bad it was. What happened to the dwarves? Why do the urgals look like that? The Ra'zac turned from powerful hunters into mindless monsters which at one point, Eragon killed one with a tree branch. I bet the director ripped random pages out of the book, and threw them off an apartment. Whatever he found was in the movie. This movie was a terrible disapointment, especially to fans. It still gets a 3 because of the special effects, the locations, and Jeremy irons was pretty good. Its not often that the best book ever turns into the worst movie ever, but this one rises to the challenge."
1369,transformers-movie,reviewguy02,7,"Yes, this is one of my most favourite films! Even though i'm not really a fan of G1 Transformers. I love this film so much! The only problem is that it has less action than it's sequels"
1370,get-out-movie,TVJerry,7,"Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams make a cute couple: He's black and she's white. When they go to meet her parents, the extremely accommodating family and some weirdly off-kilter help cause concern..and more. Writer/director Jordan Peele has created a slowly mounting sense of fear that's more about racial tension than cinematic scares. Still, the sinister portent builds with steady apprehension that leads to a brutal outcome. While satirical observations on prejudice add humor (and some plot points strain logic), the overall effect is suitably chilling and completely entertaining."

1380,transformers-the-last-knight-movie,The_T-10,8,"It's so ridiculous to see that most people still go to cinemas watching a Transformers movie expecting a decent plot and characterizations..... I've given that up since the second movie. These movies have always been about explosions and big robots beating the  out of each others, and this movie excels at it. Since this is a Michael Bay movie, it's gonna get blasted by critics (And many people) anyway. The third act's probably the best since Dark of the Moon, and the visuals are as good as you can get (Its special effect is much much better than the overrated Fast and Furious franchise). As always, the main problems are the humans, the plot, and the dialogues. But hey, like I said, I never went to the cinema watching a Transformers movie expecting any of those points to be good. Explosions and Robot fights are satisfying enough for me. We've had (Beauty and the Beast, GotG 2, Wonder Woman) and will have many other potentially good blockbusters with good storyline and decent characters (War for the Planet of the Apes, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Despicable Me 3, Dunkirk, Star Wars, Thor 3, etc.). For now, let's enjoy the junk food Michael Bay has served us."
1381,the-purge-movie,MelancholicAlc,0,"That this movie isn't universally ridiculed is a sign of how bad things have gotten in America.The concept is ridiculous and the execution is very stupid:The two messages are:- too much violence is bad, so perhaps we should reduce violence.- The purge is already happening: The one percent is waging class warfare against the middle class and the poor, with their predatory lending schemes and with their continued sabotaging of the health care system. Many reviews fail to mention that with the Health Care System, a purge is already being waged against the very poor. Both the lousy concept and the poor execution are getting in the way of all that. Concept:The idea that a purge would work on any level is ridiculous:- revenge killing!- who's gonna prevent killing from being done after 7:01? And if I call it self-defense, who would challenge me? I can murder anyone, claiming that, which is what Zimmerman did, knowing full well no white jury would ever convict a white man.- too much pressure on EMT services the day after.- the risk that arson would destroy other homes than the targets is too great.- the enormous destruction of property. The execution:As a movie it's sooo full of plotholes, it's frankly beyond believe.1. The BIGGEST and BADDEST security expert allows his 11 year old to access the security system and open the door for a total stranger.2. The BIGGEST and BADDEST security expert, who's also very rich have no back up generator???3. The house apparently has no small battlement loopholes as in an opening or apertures in the wall, from which potential intruders can be shot. Like those bored rich kids.4. the kids keep running off, makes no sense.5. they keep splitting up.6. daughter goes with the BF after BF tries to shoot her father. Very unlikely7. Mother allows neighbor to walk after neighbor beeyatch tries to kill her kids, TWICE! Some very gentle kind soft natured mother will pump you full of lead if you even look at their kids funny.8. BF shoots the father for no real reason and expects daughter to still love him?? Very unlikely9. Won't there gigantic revenge killing the next day?10. A purge day will lead to wanton and GIGANTIC destruction of property, that's always bad. Given all these problems I think the movie should be more taken as an allegory than literal, it's like the Bible on that note."

Now now, before you go ape, I do enjoy most classic movies; but in the case of this pile, where is this ""black comedy"" everyone refers to? There is not a single funny moment in this movie.

1387,her-movie,andrjet,8,"The heavenly consistence of interrupted loves This Spike Jonze’s movie has the morbid density of an embrace, and it speaks about human beings’ substance: love and solitudes. It’s Joaquin Phoenix’s body to nicely fill up every frame as Theodore, who writes letters as a job. We can see him inside an office with that pastel atmosphere we can observe all over the film thanks to the director of cinematography Hoyte Von Hoytema. Theo is dictating to the computer a message from Loretta to his beloved Chris. His soul is at the service of the others but he is affected by a pervasive form of melancholy which the willowy Arcade Fire soundtrack shows through. Along his way to home it’s evident to us the romantic aura shuffles to sci-fi atmosphere, that shows itself in the smart phone and earpiece used by Theo (and his peers) as a pleasant integration between man and machine; and the city skyline on the background tells us where we are: In a futuristic (but not so distant) Los Angeles with some grey and calming Asian tones. Theo story moves forward between his gloomy present and the memory of a happy past with his (almost-ex) wife Catherine (Mara Rooney) till a new impulse reactivates his life: He begins to get in touch to, to know and to fall in love with an innovative Operating System generated by a DNA-sequence written and formed by millions personalities of its programmers and capable of evolving in connection with experiences. OS named itself Samantha (it has the irresistible voice of Scarlett Johansson) and he is for the fractured Theo like a hot and comforting blanket in the middle of the winter. He broke up with Catherine and now he can’t feel anything, he’s a kind of anesthetized man (also a blind date goes down in flames). His salvation will resides in a sleepless night in which he can find again an emotive handhold: This is Samantha, without body but so terribly real, the only person capable of feeling Theodore: Both in the darkness pair off in a big tremor that allows them to lose boundaries of everything. It’s the beginning of the love story involving Theodore and Samantha, who rediscover the simplest things: Lovers’ laughs, a running in the subway, a day spent at the seaside through silly phrases and an intense gaze at the waves till the sunset. While Theodore regain his balance, it’s his friend Amy’s life (Amy Adams) to break up into little pieces after she have severed with Charles (Matt Letscher) and to go in Theodore’s direction: approaching with an OS. Ink on documents declares the divorce between Theodore and Catherine. Lightness of voices is the texture of his relationship with Samantha: And we are fascinated by the creamy stream of images shooting the new life of Theodore. But also an apparently perfect relation hides a crack in it and here it has the sound of a teapot whistling on a burner; And we can hear it until Samantha confess Theo he has been talking to 8.316 others (people and OS) in the last period, and he has been fall in love to 641 also. Another breakage. Samantha e Theodore leave sweetly while some teardrops bring back him inside his loneliness. But now it’s a less bitter place, a place to share with Amy (also she was left by her OS) in a hug over the rooftop in front of L.A.: past sorrows temper in the dusk, little blisses harmonize themselves and our frailty dissolves like that one of any other being on Earth, here only for a short passage."
1388,the-hurt-locker-movie,DonC,1," If you want to watch a documentary about IED's in Baghdad in 2004 and you don't know any better, this is your movie. Quickly looses its intensity with repetitious chasing, shooting and explosions, with cardboard characters. Says nothing of any consequence other that ""war is hell but gosh is the adrenaline rush addictive!"" and tries to make us sympathetic toward a character who would rather be recklessly defusing bombs in Iraq instead of spending time with his wife and young child at home. Don't waste your time or money."
1389,indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull-movie,Rob,2," Same problems as Star Wars episodes 1-3 and all of the other shameless remakes currently being released: overcomplicated plot, excessive action, awkward dialog, miscast actors, obviously computer generated special effects - all tied together by reused quotes and plot devices from the earlier films. I loved Raiders, liked Temple, and really enjoyed the Last Crusade, but this film was painful to watch. There were a few brief moments where it had potential, but then another blue-screen generated chase sequence would start."

1393,godzilla-2014-movie,Markolius,3,Disappointing. The rare action scenes were beautiful. The rest was awful- cardboard bland characters poorly acted (I love Bryan Cranston but this was beneath him). Trying to be so serious without actually pulling off any sense of believability in plot or sympathy for the characters made for a surprisingly boring experience at the cinema.
1394,the-interview-movie,nightblade00,3,I wouldn't be surprised if Sony hacked themselves to help create some buzz for this stink-fest.  The controversy and the international issues it caused were much more entertaining than the actual movie itself.  Not a good film.
1395,the-revenant-2015-movie,speedoriginal,0,"Revenant may have been filmed well, but the overall movie is just an OK experience....... The plot of the movie is appear to a little more than cliche........its more like Lieutenant Dunbar meet Robinson Crusoe, but this time Crusoe is stuck on snow crested forest and cliffs rather than an island.........and a familiar and cliche desire of vengeance drives our main character to progress very slowly through a rather simple and shallow plot. Another thing that really bothered me about this movie is that at one point the main character was almost dead, his flesh brutally torn by a feral animal and he was on death bed but then he heals on his own and with in few days he is back on horse back and even survived a fall from a cliff and a fall through a waterfall during the period he was supposed to be recuperating........the pace at which Leonardo's character recovers from his wounds is very unrealistic even in a fantasy, this is one of the factors that blew this movie for me. Its a very slow moving movie and there isn't much that happens in this movie, for the most part Leonardo's acting is comprised of moans and groans rather than actual dialogue delivery........he did a well enough job but I wouldn't give him an Oscar for this....."

1400,bad-news-bears-movie,GrantN.,3, I never thought that Richard Linklater would stoop to these levels. School of Rock was a main-stream comedy but a great one that avoided most comedy cliches.

Occasionally the stutterer says something witty, but seemingly can't think his way out of uber-typical situations. And at the end there's nothing satisfying at all. Just like life.

1403,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,ndmattm,2,"So my guess is that people who are giving this movie a great review have only seen the Phantom Menace? By all means... it is a much better movie than that one. However, the reality is that this is just A New Hope with different characters. The film critics wouldn't dare give it a bad review because it is certainly more diverse than the old movies and so they wont do that... but its a really the same plot as A New Hope just with worse actors. The whole thing makes no sense and SPOILER ALERT: How does someone who has never used the force destroy someone who studied under Luke Skywalker? This is your Darth Vader? Your Evil Lord? This? Heck, he was more like Lord Helmet from Space Balls than anything. Wow... I am sure glad I got so excited to see that. I could have just stayed home and watched New Hope. I would have been more entertained! Say what you will about the Prequels... at least they had a new story to tell. Cant believe anyone who actually saw it (other than critics) actually giving it high praise. The fact that the critics liked it should have made everyone run away fast!  Its probably a 5 out of 10 but because of all the hype for the last few years I give it a 2."

But i see a lot of zero's up here and as I read i got the impression that most of those people didnt understand the movie so im gonna try to help some of the points the complained about. 1) Now the reason there is light in the supermarket is because if you look really closely you will find its not actually a ceiling, ok, its just one big hole. I bet u missed that. 2) They aren't zombies they are pissed off because its not really a ""virus"" its more like people are transferring periods to each other. 3) The reason they dont attack other infected is because once you get bit...well...i uhhhhh...yea...4) The army fellows didn't want to get with the little girl as a cure, but just to rebuild the entire human race with 9 guys ad 2 girls. So you see once you fully understand the movie, you'll love it that much more."
1409,the-dark-knight-rises-movie,J_Jammer,7,"TDKR was far too long. It could have been 30 mins shorter. It should have been. The fight scenes flat out sucked. Too close and not enough sound power.

Catwoman worked and so did The new character played by Joseph Gordan L. the last 15 mins were what the whole movie should have been like. Oh and what's the point in naming it Gotham when it looks just like NYC? I should give it a lower score based on poor story alone, but some parts worked well."
1410,wanted-movie,GeoffU.,2," I thought this movie was dreadful. Sort of like The Matrix meets the Punisher. The action was completely over the top and unbelievable - it was unbelievable in the Matrix, but at least they had the excuse of being inside a computer simulation and not in the real world. No plot at all - a LOOM of FATE?! Come on! Terrible acting. James Macavoy makes a terrible action hero - looks like a school kid running around, none of the months-of-training martial arts of Reeves/Fishborne in the Matrix or Matt Damon in the Bourne films. The whole thing is just an excuse for special effects, which aren't bad but what's special about that any more? Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful."

All Dinesh's hatred for what is right about America shine through in all his work. If you saw Obama's America, and all his predictions of doom and gloom, you should know better than to waste your time and money on this trash.

1413,sabans-power-rangers-movie,Bekah,9,"I liked it! In the Age of 6-10 i was a die hard Power Rangers Fan. The reboot isn't as cheese as the source material, but contains the most significant elements. The acting was quite good the fighting scene were decent. I liked they used further elements of the show as inspiration for plot devices. And I was glad to hear the iconic Phrases and the Themesong. A very good decision was to cut the quantity down to certain special moments for us Fan Boys instead of using themk all the time like in the original show. Perhabs i am over stretching this, but the Productplacments-thing in it is so hilourious quirky and brutal, that i only can interpret it as a meta joke of the commercial chrakter for toys the original series has had back in the days. But there are some minor things I this like: There was a serious Lack of Martial Arts Education in the Origin Story. Jason as Footbal Quaterback make his charakter so stereotypish, that i feel a bit pity for him in comperison to the other leads. The second thing i disliked are the uninspired Stonevillians performing as Ritas basic minions. They look simply  Overall I am satisfied with the reboot. There was enough respect for the franchise, the story featured all elements it needed and combines it with enjoyable plot. We see trainign we see the personality of the Rangers, we get a convincing bonding. There is no embaressing Moments. Rita is cheese, but still evil and hits the edge between beeing ridicoulous and creepy. It's not perfekt but way way way better then exspected and even not Power Rangers Fans can like it."
1414,wilson-movie,NightReviews,3,"Have you ever met a person that was always so negative; a complete narcissist; a complete nut case who goes about doing all the wrong things, and makes the worst life choices ever? Well, if you do know a person like that and want to compare them to someone else as neurotic, Wilson is the movie for you. Woody Harrelson plays the titular title character with as much pizzazz and life as possible while being an inherently bleak as can be.Harrelson’s Wilson can best be described as the ultimate misanthrope. Nevermind Ebenezer Scrooge, Wilson is the real deal when it comes to pessimism. Taking the world with less than a grain of salt, Wilson tackles the world with the most obvious sense of negativity, blaming people and society for all thats gone wrong in his life, including his; love life, family life and most of all, all of his own quirks and habits. Don’t believe us? Just pay close attention to one very short and emotionally draining scene where Wilson visits his father on his deathbed. Like so many cases after this scene, Wilson seeks for retribution and peace in all the wrong places and times.Clearly the oddball in his almost picturesque Minnesota community, Wilson’s world shakes and shatters upon the discovery that an old flame and frequent drug user Pippi (Laura Dern) decided to keep a child they had together, who later independently decided to put the girl up for adaption. Upon the discovery of Pippi, and some sort of hope that the once love would rekindle, Wilson takes it upon himself to find his daughter Claire (Isabella Amara) and the beautiful urban family who has taken the responsibility to raise Claire as their own. As expected, in the most distasteful and awkward way possible, Wilson, along with Pippi, make it a hobby to include themselves in Claire’s life almost forcefully.Having an almost crude and grimy way of connecting with humanity as a whole, Wilson makes good-intentioned decision to involve himself in Claire’s life, until things begins to spiral out of control, in familiar Wilson-fashion, leading Wilson to state penitentiary.Luckily for us, Harrelson, one of the most versatile and interesting actors working today, allows Wilson to be a very engaging and interesting character film, focusing on the ideas of longing and loneliness. While we were fortunate enough to have the film written by Daniel Clowes, the original author of which the graphic novel the film is based off of, and Craig Johnson, director of the totally off-beat but satisfying tragic comedy The Skeleton Twins, Clowes and Johnson are able to keep the spunkiness of the almost two hour film somewhat light, keeping its flowing characters in serious need of redemption mostly entertaining and engaging.Do not get it twisted, Wilson is a very dark and comedic film, just not dark in the sense that depression and pill popping may ensue after. While Clowes has a knack of making really funny situations and characters depressing and almost unchangeable, Wilson does progress towards a satisfying yet, in its own way, Hollywood ending. While I did long for a more in-depth look or analysis of Wilson’s relationship with his father, it never comes.While Wilson showcases the many levels and various temperaments of a very flawed and almost unlikable character, by the end of the film, one cannot help to kinda/sorta fall in love with Wilson. There is an illustrious comedic poignancy of the man who barely reaps the benefits of all of life’s wonderful yet disillusioning obstacles. Decorated with slight glimpses of retribution for our beloved inane character, the world in which Wilson longs for is one that is slightly unattainable, yet charmingly whimsical.Harrelson is an actor that can pretty well play anything and anyone. Slap on a pair of thick framed glasses, a shaggy silver-laced beard and Harrelson nails all of the nuances of a impulsive man for whom bell tolls for on a daily basis, blowing up everything and everyone in his crazy and directionless path.Luckily for Clowes and Johnson (the original author of the source material and director) were able to assembler a quite impressive cast for a Sundance and indie darling. With the likes of Harrelson, Dern, Cheryl Hines and Judy Greer, giving a well needed spunk and kick in the ass to a somewhat joyless narrative, despite some uncomfortably appealing scenes of Wilson within a school playground and pet shop parking lot.Overall, Wilson may probably not be your most beloved feature of 2017, nor will it be your most memorable. Luckily for us, art is always a reflection of the images we see on screen, and if there is anything Wilson does well, its reminding us that there is light at the end of the tunnel; and no matter how bad things may end up looking or really are, hope, happiness and redemption is always in store, just don’t squander on the opportunities once they becomes apparent."
1415,pitch-black-movie,LeventeS,1," A highly derivative action/horror/sci-fi film which completely fails to deliver on the action, the horror, or the science. Forgettable, interchangeable stock characters make up the bulk of the relatively small cast. The main characters are bland stereotypes, Riddick himself is only memorable because i've heard his name so many times before. None of the action is exciting, all the horror amounts to the occasional startling due to loud noises (but only two or three times in all), and there is no science to speak of. Ten minutes in I found myself looking for excuses to stop watching, I went to the bathroom, I got a drink, I made some food. Boring, repetitive, extremely underburdened with plot and convincing dialogue, and repetitive. Do not watch this film even once, you'll have more doing exactly what you would do while watching the movie, only with all electronics off. The ambiguity of Diesel's character gets one point, but they could have made it a bigger part of the story."
1416,schindlers-list-movie,ZachQ.,10," This movie is fair to all sides, and it portrays history accurately enough for teachers to show it in their classes. I feel as though this movie captures the essence of what makes a movie great. Criticism of this movie highlights the person's ignorance."
1417,inception-movie,Bigboy1138,10,"What Nolan accomplishes is amazing, a film where the framework is so complex, the premise can stun the idle brain. I was blown away through the whole ride, from the performances, to the breathtaking visual effects. It really boils down to the strange and wonderful plot, a plot that stays with you long after the credits roll, and implications still haunt me."
1418,exodus-gods-and-kings-movie,Mcgillacuddy,2,"Tries way to hard to be an epic remake for an epic story and falls flat with monotone acting and shallow intensity. Not to mention, Ridley Scott's portrayal of Moses was simply terrible, as his character was mostly faithless and bland."
1419,lincoln-movie,DMWill,7,"I really don't think anyone really needs any kind of lengthy review of this movie at this point.  You know what it's about, or at least you should. Exceptional acting from the entire cast; a very well written script and great directing."
1420,death-at-a-funeral-movie,MartinJ.,1," This is a horrible film, its not very often that I have to turn a film off, this was the exception to the rule, the humour is mediocre at best and the whole 50 minutes I managed to watch was horrible. Don't waste your time or any money on this film. You'd be better off spending your time painting a wall and watching that dry, it'd be a darn sight more interesting!"
1421,lights-out-movie,alexmann,8,"In truth- 7.5, but I have to use whole numbers and the movie is better than a 7. Let's be honest here- it is a horror movie, and horror movies are meant to be scary. This movie delievers the scares hands down. It is the scariest PG-13 horror movie I have ever seen even. The premise is brilliant and the scares are executed with near perfection (even though it doesn't try anything new). But if you strip away the scares, or if you strip away the premise/monster you are left with the same basic bad movie horror plot. The heavy handed artificial story, the bland cliche characters, the same stupid character arc, and not to mention the bond created between two characters. If you replaced the main monster/demon with a standard ghost or Ouiji board this movie would be a 4 out of 10, but the premise and scares are so good- that it ends with a 7.5. Give it a go I say!"
1422,i-am-legend-movie,BrandonS.,8," The running argument against this movie from many review sites holds up. It's a great movie until it's last 15 minutes or so, and then it kind of tanks. It's a shame too. For people who claim it's not acting if you're acting like yourself... you probably don't know anything about acting or movies. Will Smith gives an amazing performance that blends what he seems to have learned in Pursuit of Happyness with the characters he's been playing since Independence Day. The result is a character who is extremely capable put into a situation where he is physically battling monsters as well as psychologically battling loneliness, hopelessness, desperation, and guilt. No other actor that I can think of could pull that off, and Will Smith does so effortlessly. The CGi monsters drag the movie down substantially. They are basically cartoons. This isn't anything against the CGI process, but rather the artist who created the film. The monsters often times look at the screen and shriek, and when they do so, the artists felt the need to make their jaws hyperextend to make their mouths wider and therefore more ""frightening"". Think of the mask from Scream, for instance. This is absolute cartooning 101 and it makes the monsters ridiculous and unfrightening. Poor directing choice and poor use of artist license. I think the biggest shame is that the majority fo the cast probably had no idea this stupidity was going to be put into place until the premiere."
1423,nobody-knows-movie,MarcK.,10," An intense and sad film that left me emotionally drained at the end, and yes, in tears. Not only is this the best U.S. release of 2005 (I know it was released in Japan in 2004), this is one of the best films I've seen in the last 10 years."
1424,the-constant-gardener-movie,RamonaC,0, Boring and ridiculous premise in every way. Moronic and overhyped. Avoid.
1425,prometheus-movie,JudgeHolden,7,"Prometheus has two faces. On one hand, it offers stunning 3D visuals (quite a compliment from a person who hates 3D movies), great music, very good photography and locations, not to mention good performance of the top two actors (Fassbender and Theron). On the other hand, the return to Alien universe is marked by complicated plot with too many loose elements (even dull towards the end), treated in a hasty and pretentious, new-age-ish way, which is quite a shame for a picture with a tonn of small resemblances with the genre's classics (think of 2001: Space Odyssey, Blade Runner or, more recently, Mission to Mars etc.) and books (In the Mountain of Madness, some hints at King Lear's parental drama). It seems to me that after 30 years of absence from sci-fi universe Ridley Scott wanted to tell us everything, ending with telling us nothing in specific. 6/10 for the plot, boosted to 7/10 due to great technical elements."
1426,hail-caesar!-movie,hydrallus,3,19 years. That's how long I've been a Cohen Bros fan. I like all their movies. Even A Serious Man and their more obscure works. But this film just isn't that funny or that entertaining. It's only slightly so.
1427,justice-league-movie,deepakG47,8,"It is now loud and clear that there is a bias against DC Films. I agreethat the movie is not perfect and so are 90% of MCU. It is just thatthe film is not well polished. It could have used another 15-20 minutesof time that might have made it a better film more coherent with betterconclusions. (blame Warners for that). Even though its good now it justfeels like it skips. (hard to explain, you should see it for yourself).They should have released it in July' 18 where they got an empty slotfor a DC Film. (only in case Zack does the work as Joss would entirelychange the film given time). But here Joss really tried to make thefilm better for non-comic fans too. And it lays a path that drives DCFilms into greater places. I think that the 2 hours restriction madethe film what it is. If not it might have been perfect for those whoask for it. Anyways it is good enough and you can put it in the samespot along with AoU if you need a comparison. There it is. I go with8/10."
1428,skyfall-movie,Nazgulero,0,"Unbelievable. I have never seen a movie theatre that quiet. You could literally hear people think 'my god, WTF is this  It's like the filmmakers thought 'how can we make every dialogue and every scene as bad as possible, and every character as unlikeable as possible ?'.The nerd at MI6 tops it off."
1429,the-last-airbender-movie,JazzH,0, M. Night is best at original not putting his artistic spin on an adaption. He white-washed the whole cast not one other leading actors were Asian. Why was Dev Pevel casted let alone considered he doesn't look nothing like prince zuko and didn't attempt to what happen to the hair cut what happen to the burn over his eye. If they do still make chapter two in to a movie I hope it's re-casted w/ possibly with a new director otherwise it's already lost me as a fan!
1430,the-artist-movie,MarcDoyle,10,"What an amazing film. I knew Jean Dujardin would bring talent to the table based on his comic turns in the OSS movies - and he does a great job.  But Berenice Bejo is the real find here, though.  She lights up the screen like nobody I've seen since Elena Anaya in Sex &amp; Lucia. (Or maybe Paz Vega in Spanglish - yes, that was a good movie!) It's a classic Hollywood film that shouldn't be missed."
1431,gravity-movie,mavaje,3,"Some scenes look beautiful, but that's about all I can say that's positive. The laws of physics are broken several times, in the first collision, the guy who was exposed to the vacuum of space should have exploded due to the pressure difference, in the process of docking with the several space stations it's highly unlikely that the difference in velocities would be anything less than the speed of a bullet. For a 91 minute movie one would not expect to be bored and wishing for it's termination, but that is how I felt about this movie. The story of this movie consists solely on a series of extremely unlikely and seemingly inescapable impasses, that 'somehow' are overcome."
1432,knocked-up-movie,AdamL,9," The negative comments on this film are hilarious! ""By far the worst film I have ever seen""...well apparently you haven't seen many movies at all. ""The theme of this movie is hurtful to the realities of society""...you mean YOUR reality, maybe. ""I could have walked out after 10 minutes and saved an hour of my life""...well, yes, if the movie had been and hour-and-10-minutes long. Humans are funny creatures, eh?"
1433,you-kill-me-movie,HomeReviewer,7,"I have overlooked this movie when it was released and it's through perusal of IMDb's various lists I came across it. I use the term overlooked because I usually would read the storyline and other movie information for titles that feature the Oscar winning actor Ben Kingsley; several of them appealed to my taste in the various genres he's delivered his quality contributions, though more did not. How else could I, or anyone else, have had the pleasure to see ""House of Sand and Fog"", if it weren't for the effort of looking for his stuff to start with? Kingsley has been known to make movies which potential monetary success were tentative. This movie is quite difficult to clearly categorize; it depends on the state of mind you're in at the time. I define it as a blend of dark and witty comedy with an expected but discrete drama fusion. The dialogue, mostly, captured my attention; of course, the performance by Ben Kingsley met my expectations. TÃ©a Leoni, who's every single performance of the past twenty years I liked, again, did not fail to please and entertain me; she's a professional other actors have remarked look forward to team up with. The story is simple, straightforward, has many expected moments, not to use the term predictable which nuance I purposefully like to point out; sometimes simplicity allows good actors to shine because they make details count. Denis Farina plays an Irish gangster; he usually excels at half that role, the gangster part, and I was okay with that."
1434,green-lantern-movie,aMonkeee,7,"Definitely worth watching if you're a fan of Green Lantern, but they tried way to hard to cram as much Green Lantern fan service as possible. The whole sequence with Kilowog and Sinestro training Hal prove this. Kilowog shows up, calls him a Poozer, punches him in the face, then leaves. Sinestro calls him weak, humiliates him, then leaves. They should've either went all the way with the training, or had it in the next movie. The actual plot was pretty straight forward. Nothing fancy, but it worked."
1435,brick-movie,DanB.,8," This was really good. I didn' think it dragged anywhere. And the folks who think the dialogue stunk cos ""no one talks like that"", I think they're missing the point? No one is supposed to talk like that, it's what they call a ""conceit"", that high schoolers are going to talk like gangsters in old time noir pictures? Anyway, the twist at the end had a bit less impact than it might have and there's certainly flaws, but the originality of making a noir pic in high school totally won me over."
1436,avatar-movie,CE,1," Horribly derivative, poorly acted. Visually amazing, but if I want to be wowed by visuals I'll buy one of those Magic Eye books. I saw FernGully: The Last Rainforest, and it told the same exact story but with 100% more rapping bats and lizards. I did not enjoy this at all, but now I have a sweet pair of 3-D glasses. Great."
1437,babel-movie,Alison,1, Too hard to follow without a complete end.
1438,the-revenant-2015-movie,Hide,3,"Well, most has been said already about this movie. Most importantly it just takes forever. It begins quite nicely, it grabs you but as soon as ""the painful part"" starts the whole thing goes down the litter. You will then have to watch a mix of DiCaprio grunting in pain and some nice scenery with a not much more exciting vision here and an indeed much more exciting scene containing Tom Hardy there. Really, Tom Hardy made the movie. If it wasn't for him I probably wouldn't have watched it till the end which I still somewhat regret because it was so damn long.Now don't get me wrong, I'm not against long movies at all. Just a few days before I watched The Revenant I tried The Hateful Eight which is pretty much as long as The Revenant and in that movie the time flew by. I didn't even look at the clock for once.What I especially do not understand is how DiCaprio got an Oscar for _that_. Why for this compilation of grunting-sounds but not his role in the Wolf of Wallstreet or Django Unchained? ONLY if all the stuff he did in the movie was done without any kind of special-effects as if for example he really pushed himself into a horse cadaver of some sort I would agree and say he might get his Oscar for the effort. But the acting? You might say the role didn't give him enough room to shine as much as in the aforementioned movies but, well, that's bad luck then. If any of the actors in that movie Tom Hardy should've gotten an Oscar for that."
1439,adaptation-movie,MichaelC.,2," To be honest, the feelings on this movie seemed to be mixed among the masses. I've talked to just as many people who loved it as I have who hated it. In all fairness, it is a very original idea for a movie. But this is not enough to overcome the one major problem with this movie: BORING! BORING! BORING! ! F....ING BORING!!!!! There...I said it."
1440,igby-goes-down-movie,Tss5078,7,"I really love these weird independent comedies, that you have to be somewhat intelligent to understand. They are so much different from all the repetitive crap that we are subjected to over and over again. This is the story of a kid from a privileged family who just doesn't fit in. He sees the hypocrisy of it all and decides to run away to NYC, where he meets some unique characters that you'd only find in New York. The middle Culkin brother, Kieran, stars and was incredible. Simply put, sometimes the story is good, but the movie is made by its star, and Culkin gives one of the best performances I've seen in a film like this. Igby Goes Down has a ton of stars, it's a clever story, and you really connect to the characters. I really enjoyed this film, but be warned, it's not for everybody. I honestly believe when it comes to this type of film, you need a personality that relates to some aspect of the film. Without that connection, you might not get as much out of this film as others did."
1441,thor-ragnarok-movie,Mragusa2,8,"I consider myself a DC fanboy, but I admit that I may start watching more Marvel movies after seeing this one. Hilariously funny & action-packed, Thor: Ragnarok really feels like something out of a comic book."
1442,the-town-movie,whit,9,"After seeing Gone, Baby, Gone I had some expectations for this film and am happy to report it met or exceeded most of them. This film spends a lot of time in the gray areas where good guys aren't so nice and bad guys aren't so mean (sometimes.) That might sound like the standard anti-hero theme we've seen so much in Goodfellas, Sopranos, etc. but this film still managed to make a couple unexpected turns. Can't ask for much more than that."
1443,suicide-squad-movie,That-Comic-Guy,9,"Enjoyable from beginning to end but a few flaws hold the film back from being DC's Avengers, very little Joker (never once interacts with Squad), a few underdeveloped characters and villain, and third act begins to fall apart around the end, but still holds together with an amazing cast, spectacular visuals and action, and fixes many of the flaws that most had with DC's last two superhero outings (Man of Steel, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice)."
1444,townies-movie,OpinionatedGuy,8,"I know I am not going to see a movie that has Seth Rogen in it where it will be just funny as This is The End but I know that I would I have some good laughs in this movie. The plot was okay and a bit predictable but Seth Rogen’s signature brash, over-the-top humor makes it up for it. I liked the cast of this movie which attributes why I like the characters in this movie. I am amazed at Zac Efron’s comedic effort in this movie. He is now shying himself away from the “chick flick romantic lead guy” which is great for his career. I also liked Zac Effron and Seth Rogen’s dynamic together. It seemed like they’re old buddies exchanging jokes to each other. I also like Rose Byrne’s comedic effort in this movie especially with his chemistry with Seth Rogen, she manages to be funny without trying too hard. The length of the movie is what I have a problem with. It seemed like it should have been shorter considering its concept that could be solved much more easier and faster. Although this movie is not one of my favorites like This is The End and 22 Jump Street, Neighbors is a funny movie thanks to the cast’s great comedic effort. This movie is better watched with your friends."
1445,the-men-who-stare-at-goats-movie,KevinM,0," I love farcical comedies. Anything Cohen Brothers / Wes Anderson. This was absolutely horrible. I smirked once all movie. There is no build-up to anything, no point to anything. Aside from one 15 second goat-stare-down scene, the rest of the movie's jokes and sight-gags were flat."
1446,the-mortal-instruments-city-of-bones-movie,PaperThing,1,Well... once again a piece of derivative garbage is vomited across screens around the world. It's sad that this will be occupy theatres instead of films far more worthy. Please don't waste your time.
1447,triple-nine-movie,Stan_G,7,"Seen recently as recommendation by boxxy software as “action-packed” movie. It doesn't really bring anything new to the genre, but Triple 9 is clever and thrilling enough, plot moves too fast, and characterization suffers as a result. Action sequences are great though."
1448,the-da-vinci-code-movie,TedB.,0, Yawwwnnnn... An utter waste of my time and money. I'd like the past 2 hours of my life back. What a joke.
1449,47-ronin-movie,smartyaritra,7,though it has some dull action sequences in between..but the first 40 minutes and the ending truly kept me gripped onto the movie..And its definitely one of the most underrated films of 2013..its not that bad..

1451,source-code-movie,GavGav96,7,"Initially, the audience will be left thinking of this film as okay but wondering how it could possibly do anything to make itself stick in your mind. Rest assured, it does develop and proves itself to be an emotional piece of work and cleverly written."
1452,terminator-genisys-movie,jafifi,2,"this version is completely lazy, ill thought out and horrid, they absolutely wrote out the last three terminators to come up with a movie so convoluted on its own nonsesnse that it takes a huge dump on the entire franchise"

1455,the-wolf-of-wall-street-movie,GuillermoBM,9,"Summary: The Wolf of Wall Street is entertaining, powerful and extremely amusing. 94/100 [A-] The Wolf of Wall Street is insane, hilarious and entertaining. It boasts an amazing cast and a vibrant direction. I'm not a huge fan of DiCaprio's previous work, but after seeing this I'm very impressed with his acting. Moving on, it's a three hour flick, and it wasn't boring at all. Despite its long running time it kept me interested and entertained. I usually don't like this type of films, but this one was very funny and powerful. The characters and the story are interesting too. The cast is absolutely faultless. The main character performed by DiCaprio is completely nuts, he's riotously funny and you care for him. Although some moments in the movie were too surrealistic, I still love it because it's an extremely well executed biopic that manages to be hilariously entertaining and inspiring. It is about leadership and craziness; it's a strange flick filled with a bunch of obscene and bizarre moments. It definitely earns an R rating, it has some... explicit stuff. [A-]"
1456,the-avengers-age-of-ultron-movie,Mad_Monk,3,"The first one was alright...but I got bored after about 30 minutes and fell asleep. I woke up occasionally, but was so bored I fell asleep again. Did anything actually happen in this movie?"
1457,the-witch-movie,LamontRaymond,3,"Wow, was that a snoozer.  Some of these critics are calling it ""terrifying"" and ""a classic!"" That's a joke.  I was bored for most of this sucker, and the dialogue was completely unintelligible about half the time, which is a problem when there's very little action.  This was touted as an acclaimed wide release horror film - man, I had a much better time with the horror indie Southbound that I saw last weekend.  So yeah, the oldest daughter had presence and her acting performance is solid, but the movie sets a major trap for itself and proceeds to fall right into it.  Believe me, this is a film should AVOID.  Most of my theater burst out  with laughs and boos when it was over."
1458,penguins-of-madagascar-movie,Skidberg,9,"All adults who care not for the simpler humor in life, kindly avert your eyes from this one--it's cute and fun and playful through-and-through. At 15 years old myself (and still a huge and unabashed sucker for animated movies) I watched this with my younger sister and we thought it was hilarious; we watched it about 3 times through just to fully enjoy the octopi's names, which (no spoilers) are puns. It's a family flick and we you shouldn't expect any groundbreaking twists or riveting storylines, fans of fluff and fooling around can get behind this fun Madagscar spinoff."
1459,toy-story-3-movie,eliteco3,10,"The third installment of Disney Pixar's Toy Story 3 is absoulutely sensational. The same old characters are back. Reliable Woody, spacehero Buzz and friends steal the show from the start. The movie shines in the aspect of being suitable for all ages with funny clean storylines and character development. The plot twists and scenarios can relate to everyday life and situations. Animation movies are at times limited, but the team at Disney were suberb in providing a truly memorable third Toy Story"
1460,jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-movie,shibboreth,2,"This movie has one of the worst plots and some of the worst writing of any movie I've ever seen. Full disclosure,  I slept on and off throughout the  middle portion of it, perhaps for 10 or 20 minutes total, so it might actually be worse than I'm aware of. Every single character managed to do or say something breathtakingly stupid and the entire plot repeatedly depends on these acts of inexplicable idiocy, making it perhaps the finest example possible of an ""idiot plot"". I found myself repeatedly thinking, ""why the heck would they ever do that?"" or ""why on earth would that ever happen?"" or ""why would anyone ever possibly think that?"", and the answer was always supplied shortly thereafter by the story going in some stupid direction that it couldn't have gone in without the initial stupid thing happening. It's a shame I didn't get more sleep, but the loud noises kept waking me up."
1461,doctor-strange-movie,tjman09,8,"Doctor Strange, Marvel Studios newest entry in the marvel cinematic universe, is here and it is really good. Doctor Strange may not be as well-rounded as this year’s Civil War, or some of the other Marvel gems, but it is a really good film on it’s own merit. Doctor Strange features mind bending visuals, entertaining thrills, and a fresh look at the Marvel cinematic universe (MCU). Doctor Strange is yet another strong entry in the ever impressive MCU, which makes it harder and harder to argue, that Marvel is the premiere film studio today.	This movie described simply is like watching the avengers while on acid, and the special effects are perfect. In this film the characters dance between many different realities, and essentially within these realities everything can be manipulated by the mind. The special effects are amazing in this film, which is a true compliment, because many films this year struggled with overly digitized special effects. In this film, it’s obvious that there are special effects, but they look very realistic.	The acting in this film is very good, as Benedict Cumberbatch brings his usual intense personality into his character. The action sequences are very well shot, and the film is subtly very funny. It’s admirable that Marvel refuses to step away from humor, because it’s become their true signature. One weak point about this film was that some of the characters were very flat, the villain especially so. Unfortunately, Mads Mikkelsen gives a great performance, but his character is yet another generic evil character, consumed by a bigger evil force, with little development as to why. That being said this film wasn’t all that original, but it didn’t feel recycled either. This is most likely because this film introduced viewers to the more cosmic side of the MCU. Much like Guardians of the Galaxy took viewers off earth, this film takes viewers out of normal reality. It’s impressive that Marvel can have so many characters in so many different atmospheres. In the end this film is yet another solid Marvel film. It’s not the best marvel film ever, but it’s a very entertaining, funny, well-acted, and creative film that is perfect for viewers of all ages. The film struggled a little with a cliched villain, some marvel cliches, and the occasional overly-expository dialogue. For those with children this film is perfect for them, and for those who love action or comic book film, give this film a look."
1462,the-seventh-son-movie,cryhardhumor,1,"From pathetical acting to pathetical screen writing to pathetical plot, Seventh Son is truly the bottom of the barrel when it comes to fantasy films. However I will give it points for the unintentional comedy."

1464,avatar-movie,JonS,3," Is it good entertainment? Yes. Is it a great movie? No, not even close. I walked into the movie expecting a great visual spectacle with an average plot and character development. The plot, acting and character development was so bad, however, that it frankly ruined the technological experience. I would recommend seeing it in theaters just for the visuals. This movie is not going to translate well onto the small screen. and after 5-7 years, after the technology is dated, people will look back and think ""this is a truly awful movie."" There is nothing beyond the visuals to carry this ham-fisted outing. Once the technology is no longer new, this will definitely not stand the test of time. I would think with $250 million, James Cameron would have bought himself a script."
1465,godzilla-2014-movie,mindzoo,2,"This was one of the most disappointing films of the year. It starts off with a great introduction to who I thought would be the main character in the film, but soon afterwards it takes a nosedive as we instead follow a boring, emotionless, unmotivated and bland protagonist as he connects the dots in a contrived plot bringing the film to its predictable conclusion. Huge disappointment."
1466,the-amazing-spider-man-2-movie,jiunguyenphuc,10,"While i watch the trailer i really waiting for this movie, when this movie came out, i really love this movie, the story is so fantastic, although the action are less but awesome...I don't care about another review rate not good but with a Marvel fan, it's a movie for you"
1467,green-zone-movie,Spangle,8,"Green Zone is a terrific film that may take some creative liberties at times, but is always incredibly well paced,  edge of your seat thrilling, and a fantastic look at the Iraq War from the inside. Matt Damon is great in this role as a soldier who quickly realizes their intel is bad and Iraq has no WMDs. Tense and thrilling, there are rarely films nowadays that leave me on the edge of my seat, but Green Zone made me think I was going to have a heart attack - it was that thrilling and energizing. The film, politically, has been criticized as ""anti-American"". I am not seeing it. If anything, it is pro-understanding. Those who try to learn more instead of sticking their head in the sand are rewarded. Those who put down dissenters are villains. That said, the film's simple point of, only Iraqis should run Iraq is very well built up to and a fair point. With so many factions in Iraq, nobody is better equipped to handle running the country than them. We certainly know that now. As for Green Zone, it is a terrifically entertaining and thrilling action war film that is wonderfully directed by Paul Greengrass and his action muse Matt Damon."
1468,rough-night-movie,BUTCHYPIE,10,"I went with a big group, and everyone really enjoyed this film.  Lots of laugh out loud moments!  Yes, it does sound derivative from the trailer, but it was unique. Stellar cast really pulls it together.  Funniest comedy I've seen in a while in the theater.Perfect date night movie or girls night out."
1469,sicko-movie,WW,10," So many reviewers seem to have such disdain for Moore that he could have made Citizen Kane and they'd still try to tear down every aspect of the film. They seem to make the review so personal, instead of looking at the film and casting Moore aside. Sicko may not be perfect, it may slant to the left and simplify a VERY complex issue,, but it does magnify a very real problem facing America. And, sadly, most Americans need a simplified explanation of the healthcare issue if they are to begin to understand and care about the issue beyond a passive once-over. Regardless of whether you swing from the left, right, or middle, SICKO does force its viewers to look at America's failures in providing adequate health care. Clearly, our system is flawed, it serves the rich and pisses on the poor, and puts profit before ethics time after time. This film offers few solutions, but it does attempt to spark a fire that will hopefully spread to real debate and lead to real change. And, maybe most importantly, it forces viewers to ask themselves one critical question: ""How can the richest country in the world treat its ailing citizens so damn poorly?"""
1470,the-departed-movie,TimM.,10, wow. holy freakin crap. words do not do this film justice. this is a freakin masterpiece. one of the best films this year?... my ass. one of the best films in 10 years. this movie will blow you away. i have zero complaints whatsoever. it could not have been better. i will definitely go see it again soon.
1471,apocalypto-movie,Julien,3," It's so violent that we finish by thinking that Mel Gibson is a sick person. His last movie is not even interesting because of its bad direction, and its stupid story. Hopefully we can save some good moments of action in the jungle for example, but it's not enough to say that ""Apocalypto"" has to be seen. At least it's not worse than ""The Passion""."
1472,adventureland-movie,moviegrabbag,2,"Kristen Stewart is a horrible actress. She licks her lips or sticks her tongue out before she delivers almost every line. This movie was also boring as hell. There was nothing likable about this movie or any o characters in this film. Everybody is just a jerk or a waste of space. It makes me sad that Jesse Eisenberg an Ryan Reynolds were in this movie, they can do so much better. Don't waste your time."

1474,paper-towns-movie,joshmullerr,1,"The acting was below average with promising performances from Smith and Wolff. However, the catastrophic performance from Delevinge was completely detrimental to the already plainly-average final product. This film adaptation from the book of the same name revolves around the charming yet mysterious Margo (portrayed by Cara Delevinge) which told from the narrative of the typical invisible high school boy, Quentin (Natt Wolff). However, the adaptation changes the form of Margo, with the efforts of Delevinge, which would have been a filmmakers' dream and transforms her into a plain-Jane, hideously acted and overall boring character. If the role was based on eyebrows, it would be understandable as to why Delevinge was considered. However, its not and a promising career from the former model will not be anticipated."
1475,captain-america-civil-war-movie,yosemite,7,"Its a movie about comic book characters and as that, its pretty good. The actors performing these parts are very good especially Downey. The visuals are good and the plot is fairly good. One of the minor negatives is that the studios are introducing new characters to spin off in future projects. It can get a bit confusing as so many characters are fighting in fast moving action scenes. I thought the young naive Spider Man stood out . The Jeremy Renner character adds nothing and neither does the mighty gnat or whatever he is. Scarlet always looks great and her character did not get enough screen time. All in all , a pretty decent action film"
1476,before-sunrise-movie,seancriswell,9,"The story could not be more simplistic. An American Male meets a French Female on a train and asks her to spend the evening with him in Vienna. What is not simplistic is the wonderful characters, and exceptional dialogue in Linklater's film. It is obvious that Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) have a connection after their first conversation. As their day progresses their connection to each other deepens as does our connection with them. Before Sunrise is so special because we are not manipulated into connecting with them through tragedy, or violence, or sex. We connect with them as we do with people in everyday life, through the life experiences they share with us little by little as our relationship grows. This is true intimacy and is beautifully achieved here. The intimate, personal moments that Jesse and Celine share throughout the film are sprinkled amidst a plethora of other conversations during their night together. They discuss everything from palm reading to dancing, the conversation is never boring and never unnecessary. They don't agree on everything and through that disagreement we we are invited further into their personalities as their connection grows. Jesse and Celine do interact with other characters in the course of the film. Linklater perfectly blends these interactions as well. The supporting characters add to the film without over powering the main characters. These characters are also just odd enough to further strengthen Jesse and Celine's connection as kindred spirits, without ever becoming caricatures. Before Sunrise is a beautiful film. It made me want to rush off to Europe and spend aimless evenings wandering around foreign cities looking for romance. I suppose I will have to settle for revisiting this film and these characters in the future."
1477,murder-of-a-cat-movie,Tone01,2,"Check any screen writing manual for definitions of plot point, twist, rising action. Then the RomCom playbook: meet girl, lose girl by self, regain girl, lose girl to externals, win girl. Paint-by-numbers. The script for ""Murder of a Cat"" is a textbook example. Each move is telegraphed. Each line moves toward the big twist right on time at minute 77. It may not be enough to discount this, or any film, but sadly there's nothing else to recommend it. The chemistry between Nikki Reed and Fran Kranz is nonexistent. The former sleepwalks through a thankless, underwritten part while the latter, a sexless man-child living with Mom, was surely directed to angrily shout every line. Even the venerable J.K. Simmons phones it in, as does Greg Kinnear. Only Blythe Danner turns in a nuanced performance. Further, Fran Kranz isn't a character, he's an annoying, trite and insulting caricature that's an affront to sensibility. That leaves only plot: a Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew quest for the killer of Franz' cat. The yawn-inducing trail leading to the killer is paved with ennui and inane set pieces rolled in obvious that the filmmakers incorrectly believed was quirk. There's a slapdash, let's-get-this-over feel to the proceedings which may derive from a tight shooting schedule. That might be forgiven, but when the cast isn't invested that feeling wafts over the footlights to hapless audiences. That conceit is the worst aspect in this useless film. ""Murder of a Cat"" is an unfunny, undramatic, unwatchable insult not worthy of anyone's time. Maybe your cat will like it. (Maybe they'll wish for the same fate as the cinematic feline.)"
1478,the-karate-kid-movie,BenH.,2, Kind of disappointing.
1479,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,IDreamcasterI,0,"The worst Star Wars movie by far, and this is coming from someone who hated The Phantom Menace.  There are no redeeming qualities in this movie.  A complete waste of potential."
1480,the-producers-movie,rcunard,1, This is the only movie that I have ever walked out on. Thankfully I got my money back. Good actors - stupid characters. Some plays should stay on Broadway. The theater is for MOVIES - not plays. Hear me Rent???
1481,watchmen-movie,AnonymousMC,9,"Poster of Watchmen said: By visioneer Zack Snyder. That's why this great movie ain't going to any respect! No one understands genius' before they die...except I do. This movie had great story, effects and acting. Really, what's wrong with the movie? Maybe too much crap talk but that's it! The haters just can't stand watching superhero movie with only ONE superpowered person."
1482,headhunters-2012-movie,Compi24,8,"In attempting to be both a noir and a man-on-the-run thriller, ""Headhunters"" already has big shoes to fill, but when the pitch is to also add in a couple hints of Guy Ritchie and ""The Thomas Crown"" affair, now you're just talking crazy. Well, ""Headhunters"" is nothing short of just that -- craziness. Director Morten Tyldum, performers Aksel Hennie and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, and chief screenwriters Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryberg, take this Jo Nesbo story of excess, hubris, and danger, and elevate to the heights of cinematic confection. This is a richly over-the-top, yet still nail-bitingly thrilling caper with enough twists and caveats to keep glued to the screen for (what I hoped would end up being) a three-and-a-half hour affair. And though it sadly comes in at just under two, boy, is it a ride to remember."
1483,annihilation-movie,Manutddabest,2,"Why is an Oscar winner acting in this heap of thrash. Cheap effects and lousy storyline. For real sci fi, watch Underworld. I support Man Utd!"
1484,the-life-aquatic-with-steve-zissou-movie,PatC.,3," Interesting and original concepts keep one waiting for the story to take off. All the pieces come together, but none of them click into place. Harmless, but with chemistry between the actors prohibited during production. Not even Cate Blanchett can save this. I blame the director and editor. It should have worked."
1485,2012-movie,Sausage,3," Continents displace, super volcanoes erupt, cities vanish, tidel waves swallow the Himalayas...every distaster you could possibly imagine is in this movie...except one that shouldn't be....THE SCRIPT!!!!!"
1486,annabelle-movie,felix99gomez,1,"Annabelle is an uninspired, lazy cash grab, which relies on cheap jumpscares, following a formula you've seen a thousand times done better, in an attempt to take advantage of The Conjuring's success, a movie that, while still following some of the classic horror movie genre, showed you can deliver make a good horror movie, with a few of the typical jumpscares here and there, but never forgetting that well developed characters and atmosphere is what really makes a good horror movie work. Annabelle doesnt even try."
1487,the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-movie,citroenpers,9,"I've waited so long for this movie, and there it finally is. The special effects are even better than the LoTR. And it has an even warmer feeling then the Lord of the Rings-trilogy. But I've to admit that there are some negative sides. The prologue has for a example a bit childish feeling. The humor and the characters sometimes feeling as they are picked from a Disney-movie. And secondly (an expected argument) is that the story less epic than the first trilogy. Over all is the movie very entertaining and I would recommend it to every LoTR fan"
1488,the-blair-witch-project-movie,MEGA_CRITIC,0,"please dont bother watching this film, if you want a scare because it honestly isnt scary or creepy (well maybe a bit, but not enough) if you want a scare watch sinister, i highly recommend it, and it is genuinely scary"
1489,the-grey-movie,MullerHowth,3,"Awful!  A Hollywood studio obviously stamped Neeson's name on this one to guarantee covering it's  costs. Glad it was a red box! Unrealistic from start to finish. What a waste of money and resources. No knife edge survival of the fittest drama, just lots of very uninspiring metaphors and cliche melancholy. Come on Liam your better than this. Who are these film critics giving The Grey a 6.6 anyway???"
1490,the-spongebob-movie-sponge-out-of-water-movie,Whopping,7,"If you're a fan of Spongebob, then you'll with out a doubt enjoy this movie, the humor hasn't changed and there's lots of funny moments. I'm glad the movie sticks mostly to it's standard 2D animation, with only about 20% of the movie being 3D animation. However I don't think it holds up much against the first movie, it lacked the bang and creativity it had."

1492,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Antorin,0,I love how in the bad ratings you see people listing what's wrong with the movie.And good ratings are just a bunch of people insulting others for not gobbling this garbage up like they did.This says everything you need to know about this movie.
1493,harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-movie,DGirl,3," If you've read the book consider this a disappointment. Storylines and charectors were dropped, actors were changed, it was scary. The only thing stopping me from giving it a zero is the wonderful effects."
1494,blair-witch-2016-movie,imthenoob,0,It's funny how they call it a sequel yet it feels exactly like a remake. It does nothing to improve upon the already junk franchise and does absolutely nothing original that the other guy isn't already doing. It's garbage like every other film in the series. Now let it die please.
1495,because-i-said-so-movie,PaulF.,0," This is the first movie I have ever, and I mean ever, that I have given the score of 0 to a movie. Usually I would reserve such a rating for the blunder of leaving the lens cover on the camera before shooting. And rarely do i write a review a movie because I did not like it but this movie I hated so much I could not resist to give others warning to stay away from this poor excuse for a movie. It took me less than five minutes watching before I took this movie out of the player and back into the jacket. !!!WARNING SPOILER!!! To illustrate just how horrible this movie was I will describe the opening scenes. The movie starts out with a mother at her daughters reception along with her other daughter she is trying to fix up. She sees a handsome man in the distance and points out this among others facts to her daughter. She warns her daughter not to laugh the way she does when she gets nervous because she sounds like a pig. So far it seems super fiscal and slightly too involved which is what the movie is about so I continue watching. The next scene is the mother getting a phone call from her daughter. The daughter is in her slip upstairs still at the reception with the man she just met less than a hour ago. His bare feet are prompt up humming waiting to get it on. Her mother reminds her that this man is financially well off. When her daughter baulks her mother reminds her that one of her breasts is smaller than the other which triggers her daughters insecurity to go ahead and have sex with this man. I understand this movie is about a mother being over controlling but this just goes over the top. This is not just about simply funny dysfunctional but seriously psychologically disturbed behavior. I felt this movie made light of something that should have been portrayed as a serious offense. In my opinion not the best role model of movies."
1496,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Elbor,1,"The new trilogy excels at the level of inconsistencies, scripting facilities, in superficiality, with a deafening absence of a quality soundtrack.No captivating narration, characters little charismatic, this film brings nothing good to the universe.I have to put a bad note to alert Disney.I hope they will think about their scenario for the next longer."
1497,moonrise-kingdom-movie,jellopappa,9,"The sets, photography were all from the point of view of a 13 year old.  And it was done with a great sense of humor, and good eye for artful viewing.  The movie was as much a Sendak style adventure as it was a teen's internal quest for autonomy, intimacy, and love."
1498,iron-man-2-movie,AustinT,3," I found this film to be highly disappointing. When I saw the first Iron Man, I was blown away by it. It was an epic, action packed adventure. Which included an excellent, easy to follow script and a great, entertaining story. One of the best super hero movies I had ever seen. This movie however couldn"
1499,babel-movie,TheProphet,1," What the hell! This movie got such great reviews from everyone, though I really can't see how. This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen."

1502,500-days-of-summer-movie,Rilwin,9,Its one of the best movies I have seen in sometime. The character Tom resembled a lot like me and the character Summer resembled exactly like my Ex. I just love this movie.
1503,puss-in-boots-movie,TheQuietGamer,7,"Funny and enjoyable, also a good way to bring back Puss in Boots, some of the humor can be a little inappropriate so don't let the very young ones see, but if your looking for a good rental and like DreamWorks previous movies then this is a good choice."
1504,hitchcock-movie,JunelKean,7,"Set on the New Hollywood, Hitchcock is the story of Alfred Hitchcock and his relationship to other people during the making of one of the best movies ever made, Psycho. It does not only explore the world of the entertainment during the 60s, but also tours the fascinating mind of the Master of Suspense. This also shows the struggles of marriage between Alfred and Alma in spite of their careers and time as a couple.First of all, Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock is well-built. His chemistry with Helen Mirren is escalated to make a darkly humorous mood to the film. Also, the dialogue is supported with classy delivery from the two lead protagonists and is filled with sense of humor.Meanwhile, the film suffers from tonal inconsistency and a specific subplot involving a love triangle. Some die-hard Hitchcock fans would think of this as the distracting parts of the movie. But still, it honors and respects the material, the master himself, would enjoy.VERDICT: The master is immortalized by Hopkins, but suffers from consistency and storytelling."
1505,tiny-furniture-movie,Poppobill,1,This was without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever gone to see.  The movie had very little direction and several times I almost walked out.  I decided to stay until the end and the ending was just as bad as the film.  Why the critics rated it as high as they did is beyond me.  I feel if the movie was that good it would have been release to more than just a handful of theaters.  Save your money and stay home from this one....
1506,indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull-movie,DavidV,7," Pretty much what I was expecting from the next Indiana Jones movie. Still fun, with great stunts and a charismatic Harrison Ford. There were some ridiculous scenes, but as I said before, I went in expecting them."
1507,the-dark-knight-rises-movie,Xposure,7,"To put it shortly; it's good, but not as good as people make it out to be. The plot is great, the score is superb, the action sequences are mostly top notch, and the actors deliver solid performances. Unfortunately, the movie also contains obvious flaws. It's got a fair few cliches, Bane is not that great of a villain, and the ending doesn't leave enough to the imagination."
1508,the-naked-gun-from-the-files-of-police-squad!-movie,Katherine,10," If you watch this, and you have the same sense of humor, you'll laugh your pants off!"
1509,fast-food-nation-movie,ThaiK.,1," Any book or video that exposes corporations as totalitarian top down non-democratic highly subsidized immoral institutions must receive some merit for their input toward social responsibility. This film hints at this concept. However, there is no question that the book this film is based on deserves substantial recognition for the effectiveness of clarifying this terrible reality of corporate interference that bleeds into society like an unseen plague. Just the one fact highlighted in the book, not mentioned at all in the movie, that details how the corporate sector has gone from advertising on the sides of busses to editing and providing school books that 'compromise' topics of health when fast food is mentioned should be enough to frighten the general population into learning much more about these parasites. The film is a terrible attempt at portraying anything near the value of the book, but like I said, any hint or mention of the nasties that go on because of the highly concentrated power in the corporate sector is worth something. My main suggestion is to please read the book. After that read another and another. Any book of any lean, right-left-middle, doesn't matter since learning is the reason for reading. Television and mass media, your own newspaper, all market what they want you to become by providing highly censored content. Books are usually written by passionate people with real purpose behind their concerns for society, just like Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation - the book, not the movie."
1510,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,alissa914,2,"A subplot that served no purpose since it was all unraveled and just let them to saying, ""oh they're trying to escape to that small planet over there which we should've seen coming by looking out these large windows...""  Some bad humor, these pog things that are apparently supposed to be cute but don't actually do anything.They even try to rehash the ""Traitor"" line from Force Awakens but it was just bad.  The fight scenes were badly filmed....The only real redeeming qualities of this film involved Rey and Ben.... Adam Driver and Daisy were excellent but the direction was just so bad and it didn't help that many times there was just humor which wasn't funny and was rather pointless (like much of it in the casino).  As someone put it to me... it felt more like a Disney film than a Star Wars film and is a HUGE stepback from Force Awakens and definitely Rogue One which was the pinnacle of the Disney Star Wars universe so far.  Force Awakens had some odd moments too (like the aliens chasing them on the transport vessel when they captured the Falcon...  but that was better directed.I can see that I should've come here instead of Rotten Tomatoes for a review but even there now, the users are rating this at around 56%.  Still, I used my Movie Pass and paid nothing to see it and I'm still feeling ripped off.  :)"
1511,the-dictator-movie,DefyTheFallen,8,"Seemed to be a more cinematic approach to the dictator than his previous films, which felt a little odd at first, but the jokes are plentiful and hilarious! The film becomes instantly much more fun if you go to watch it with a group of friends, even though some of the scenes are a little 'awkward'. Sacha Baren Cohen still hasn't raised the bar above Borat yet, but after the disaster of Bruno, this is a step in the right direction."
1512,kick-ass-2-balls-to-the-wall-movie,Gamer147,10,"Not even going to pretend the pretentious so-called 'critic reviews' are worth even a small particle of my attention. They suck huge monkey balls, and that's just that. This movie is by far one of the greatest movies I've seen the entire year, comes real close to the first. Which leads me to think, if you liked the first, you'll love the second. Go for it."
1513,american-beauty-movie,RogelioG,10," I absolutely loved this movie! Very entertaining and dramatic. What ever message, if any, the director was trying to send, i don't care. The acting was great and so was the plot. A very watchable movie for mature audiences."
1514,the-babadook-movie,LeoKearse,3,"This is a weak, unpleasant film. It starts well, there are a few jolts and the film looks like it's going in an interesting direction, but then spoils it all with tricksy music video editing and showing too much of the monster, which throws the the suspense and suspension of disbelief. It trades in atmosphere and shocks for meanness and cruelty, then meanders around and ends about 5 times. By the time it did end we'd been bored for a while."
1515,transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-movie,AnonymousMC,2,absolutely junk!!! man i liked the first one and it was the first bay's movie that i actually liked but that one was too loud too long and sux!!!. If i was the editor i think the movie was about 1 hour... Too much unnecessary shots and talks that makes most of the movie to a garbage time!!!
1516,ted-2-movie,BigDegs29,8,"It's not structured like most movies; it seems to have several climaxes and tapering off periods.  But still a very enjoyable movie.  Not sure why critics were so hard on it.  It's definitely the funniest movie I've seen this year.  Better than the first one. Not once did I find the pace too slow as others have said.  Having a good pace doesn't mean that the whole movie should be a headlong rush.  You need to sprinkle in some down time.  And that's what they do. Also, for once, the cameos in this movie were spot on!"
1517,babel-movie,kublay0880,2,"What a boring movie, it might have a background message but to me it seemed a totally UNNECESSARY MOVIE, brings nothing fresh to the viewer and it's nothing that you haven't seen in the news. It's like watching the news but with actors."
1518,king-kong-movie,AlbertSchweitzer,1," Very, very, very, very, very, very, very bad. Laughable, dull, trite. Far less convincing than the original in terms of character emotions and especially the logic of its action scenes. Self-serious in the extreme. Jack Black is terrible. On the upside, three excellent action sequences (amounting to ~20 minutes) and good acting (in thankless roles) from the rest of the cast. Not quite believable but nice-looking mock-ups of Depression-era New York."
1519,my-name-is-khan-movie,LiasT.,10, Lets face it guys that we Americans are raciest. We too as a society is not perfect. If a film like Slumdog can show the dirtiest sites of India then why not a bolly movie like MNIK can show the bloody aspects of Americans. I rate this movie 10 out of 10. Even though this movie is very unAmerican but lets remember that its an Indian movie and we have a huge cultural difference.

1523,monsters-vs-aliens-movie,BillP,8, Hey! I was entertained. I enjoyed the references to the old horror movies and monster movies of the 50s. I saw it in 2D and was impressed by the details in the animation. Susan's skin texture almost had a photographic quality. Animation has come a long way in the last two decades. Go see this movie and escape for awhile. Enjoy a few chuckles. It is definitely worth your time and money.
1524,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,pump-kin,3,"Movie ratings are inherently subjective. You might agree on some points (cinematography) and disagree on others (plot, character motivation), but how those individual aspects weigh into the overall impression of a movie can be completely different from person to person.Initially, I glossed over many things I didn't like about this movie, because of the few things that I did like. But the more time passes, the more those few things fall apart upon further scrutiny. One example with a little bit of added detail: I liked the way Snoke manipulated both Rey and Kylo through their force connection, which he himself orchestrated, and how he baited Rey to go into the belly of the beast. When she realizes that she was played, it's too late. So they are in this situation, in the throne room, how can it be resolved? I don't think there are a lot of options (Rey dies, or Kylo decides to save her and fight Snoke and they try to escape, etc.). What happens instead is that Kylo kills Snoke (this seemingly omnipotent and omniscient being) in a way that simply seems cheap given Snoke's previously established strength in the force. Rey and Kylo both got played and the consequence? Nothing. Encounters like this feel scripted to a point where all that counts are aesthetics and furthering a certain plot point. It doesn't matter that Snoke is extremely powerful and his plan succeded. What matters is Rey and Kylo, so everything else needs to fall in place, whether it makes sense or not. This was a recurring theme in the movie.Liked:- Yoda scene- R2D2 playing the Leia clip to convince Luke- Force connection scenes- Cinematography- Most of the principal acting- Luke questioning the Jedi code- A few other things that slip my mindDisliked:- Entire Canto Bight subplot- The main plot which only served one purpose: adding a sense of urgency; but was devoid of logic in most parts- Rey fighting off several Elite Praetorian Guards, having gotten almost zero training by Luke (yes, I only say that because I can't handle a female Jedi protagonist /s)- Character motivations don't make sense- Gaping plot holes- Leia shoud've died or that scene never should've happened- Irrational lines that are supposed to evoke emotions (Rose to Fin: ""you win by saving who you love, not destroying what you hate""; just after you prevent him from saving what HE loves by sacrificing himself in what would've been a great arch for Fin; and btw, how? By crashing into him in high speed mere meters from the front line of the First Order, what? What?!)- Space is not a vacuum (several instances of this)- Luke, the dude who believed in the good in Vader and was willing to die for it, is going to kill a child (his only nephew) because of a premonition.... yea, either flesh that change in his character out properly with more backstory or something (I get that they tried to rationalize it by having him say that it was an instinctive moment which he immediately regretted, but at least for me, that didn't work)For most of the time in this movie, I was just not invested in the story or the characters. Not because I didn't want to be (quite the opposite actually: I like the characters established in TFW) but because so much of what was happening just wasn't making any sense to me. And you start realizing: nothing matters, there is a starting place for a few characters and they need to end up at a particular place by the end, but how that happens, everyhing in between, is of minor importance."
1525,over-the-hedge-movie,Rox22,7,"Not a bad movie. While it is nowhere near as good as it could have been, it still is a really nice family film. The plot is obvious, the story is a bit cliched and the overall tone a little bland. But, it has some really good visuals, the characters are really well done and lovingly brought to life by the voice actors. I was really surprised that even Avril Lavigne did an OK job (by comparison to others like her that is extremely high praise. Steve Carell perhaps steals the show and adds some of the best laughs in the movie. Overall: While it will never be considered a classic, it still is a fun film worth a watch if you haven't seen it."

1528,a-christmas-story-movie,lasttimeisaw,7,"Surprised to see this film listed among Top 250 films of IMDb years ago (a glory will not return considering it has been outranked by other newcomers), but still it is an unthinkable feat since family-slewed holiday season comedies has rarely been able to manage on that prestigious list, less to mention it is from a Tinseltown hack, the late director Bob Clark. Now I finally have watched it with BluRay calibre, what can I say? It is a damn good family boon, a bona-fide Christmas film outshines all its contemporary duds. Set in 1940s, an ordinary American family, Ralphie is a schoolboy lives with his parents and a younger brother Randy, all he wants for the approaching Christmas is a BB gun which every adult considers it is dangerous since it will shoot your eyes out! (An utter antithesis of what I wanted when I was that age, of course, not for Christmas, for Spring Festival instead). So the film minutely recollects what has happened during this unforgettable Yuletide by a congenial voiceover from Ralphie in his adulthood, the mischiefs at the school and at home, all from Ralphie’s viewpoint, which perfectly aligns with the whimsical nature of a kid’s chimera. Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin makes such a dynamic onscreen duo as the cool mother and the naff father (McGavin is too old to be their old man, a grandfather should be more appropriate though). What happens in the family (a piggy-imitation incentive on the dining table, the leg-shape lamp accident, the icicle misconduct, and the f-word punishment etc.) radiates great affinity towards its viewers since it is not overtly soliciting for instant laughters, rather it stays with its audiences and brings ripple effects to everyone’s own memory of their most memorable holidays in childhood. Peter Billingsley, a bespectacled precocious over-thinker, does offset the abundance of epidemic smart-alecks among recent child-performances. Tedde Moore, as Ralphie’s schoolteacher, whose deadpan sanctimoniousness satires the traumatizing condescendence on the nose, personally I have met quite a few in my school days. Other skits such as Peter and the wolf parody, the impatient Santa Claus with his fiendish elves in the mall, and the tongue-stuck-on-the-ice prank, all goes well without hyperbole. Bob Clark may not be a great filmmaker, and A CHRISTMAS STORY doesn’t possess any unique talking point among cinephiles, but with a retrospective nostalgia, it certainly occupies a snug spot among many people’s guilty-pleasure bracket."

1538,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,HarryMercer,2,"Why not a fanatic, I have always been a Star Wars fan and was really looking forward to the Last Jedi. I avoided all spoilers and went to screening just a few days after it was released.Unfortunately, despite trying to remain positive throughout the viewing, ultimately I was left hugely disappointed. For me the movie was totally superficial. A good looking movie that  lacked any real soul or depth in either the story or the characters. That was the real problem for me, Star Wars or any good movie has always been character driven for me. I feel a connection to the characteristics and become invested in their story. The Last Jedi had the opposite affect on me. Characters that I had been interested in like Rey, Finn and Poe and even long time favourites like Luke Skywalker came across as quite plastic and to be honest almost unlikeable. By halfway through the movie their story had little suspense because I no longer cared what happened to the characters.After watching the movie I was quite interested in others opinions and was quite surprised by the positive reviews that it received from critics. Especially reviews that praised it for it’s originality and for taking chances. I know it tried to shock at different stages but it came across as being cheap and gimmicky rather than anything of real substance. In fact I wished that they had followed through with some of these scenes. They could have made some of these characters more compelling maybe even making Kylo Ren a formidable villain.Overall the movie was just disappointing or as some of my friends put it a ‘lemon’. i do realise that half the viewing population loved the movie and to those people more power to you in fact I feel a bit jealous because I wished that I enjoyed it as well but I can’t recommend this movie as anything more than a B movie time filler."

Of course, this is not the world that critics would want their audiences to think about since film is about creating an artificial escape that perfectly resembles liberal/atheist ideologies.

1542,rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie,MrMovieBuff,8,"'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is a fantastic return to form for the iconic ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise, director Rupert Wyatt crafts an intelligent science-fiction action movie filled with amazing special effects, and a committed performance from Andy Serkis in motion capture as the leading ape named Cesar. As soon as Cesar is born, his mother unfortunately dies and is taken home by researcher Dr. William Rodman (James Franco), who decides to raise the little Cesar, and uses some sort of new antidote to see what kind of an effect it will have on apes, and how can it help humans. His father (played by John Lithgow) has dementia, and Dr. Rodman, after seeing how much Cesar has advanced to almost the same intelligence as a human, sees how it will change his father, and it changes everything for the better. One day, Dr. Rodman meets a primatologist named Caroline (Freida Pinto), and they fall in love, as well as take care of Cesar together. Back at the lab, where all the apes are being experimented on, eager businessman and Dr. Rodman's boss, Steven Jacobs (David Oyelowo) wants to take this antidote to the next level, and continues to experiment on the species of the apes and see what they'll do next as far as their intelligence goes. It also seems that Cesar is almost too dangerous to live in their neighborhood, so Will and Caroline decide to take him to a Primate Shelter, where the boss (Brian Cox) seems to take more dramatic measures in how they keep the apes. What makes this movie so effective is the realistic take on the characters and franchise, instead of ridiculous ape outfits worn by humans and looking noticeable, the motion capture was a clever idea, and seeing the apes develop with their intelligence and how they communicate through sign language instead of speaking fluently all the time. Rupert Wyatt beings us one of the most intelligent summer movies of 2011. This is a movie not to be missed."
1543,solo-a-star-wars-story-movie,JennyKat570,0,"LOL remember when a new Star Wars movie was a major cultural event, with people lining up and getting excited for it? This is the first time I've ever seen a Star Wars movie arrive and most of the public doesn't even seem aware of it. It's a total ""meh, I guess maybe I'll see it, though I'd rather go see Avengers again"".And well it should be, considering that this is quite possibly the worst Star Wars Disney has made yet (though Last Jedi is tough competition for that title). Han has none of the edgy cool that made people love him in 1977, he spends most of the movie being bullied by shrill women. Lando swishes and sashays through every scene, totally unlike the cool dude from Empire Strikes Back. The Kessel Run story gets wrecked too through the use of a lame ""shortcut"". No surprise this movie had a very troubled production and had to be almost entire re-shot, though it looks like it didn't help that much.Anyway, skip it and watch it on Netflix, if at all."
1544,baby-driver-movie,Raven25,3,RATINGS ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED BY SHILLS. BEWARE.The movie is not 'different' or 'unique'. It is a very poor man's version of Drive with Ryan Gosling.  Almost identical plot. The difference is that it is cartoony and constantly blaring noise (music?) throughout. The characters are effectively just unoriginal tropes. The attempts at being artistic were also a complete miss. The camera shots that attempted to be slick were poorly executed.  The red filter used throughout the film made it look like a giant advertisement for itself with no substance. Completely over-engineered in a desperate attempt to be artistic. The chase scenes were also boring.

1546,45-years-movie,BHBarry,9,"""45 Years"" was written and directed by Andrew Haigh based on a short story by David Constantine. It stars Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay who, at 69 and 78, respectively, play the parts of Geoff and Kate Mercer, a supposedly happily married couple as they, or more properly, Kate, plans their 45th Wedding Anniversary celebration at the local banquet hall. Spanning a period of less than a week in their lives, this is the story of a long lost romance Geoff had well before he ever met Kate and how this 50 year old experience suddenly impacts on their present lives and, more significantly, Kate’s reaction and response to what she now learns about it. Mr. Courtenay plays a subdued and stoic role as he attempts to move on from the past while Ms. Rampling’s character becomes more absorbed with the historic details as if this now deceased part of her husband’s life is still alive and in competition with her. Enough cannot be said of the wonderful acting of Ms. Rampling who, with little or no dialogue, is able to express more emotion and feeling than most actors might if they were shouting. Although the film is long and at times somewhat tedious, it is in effect mirroring the relationship of the couple on the screen as they, in their typical British civility, struggle through the emotional obstacles that confront them. I give the film a 0 rating and credit Mr. Haigh with successfully accomplishing the dual role of good writing and directing."
1547,insidious-movie,G_Mackzy,9,Good to see a genuinly scary movie that didn't had to revert to use gore as a shock tactic. Watching a movie a second time will also allow you to pick up subtle bits and pieces that you may have missed the first time. For instance I saw a boy standing in the corner of the camera shot as one of the protagonists walked past that I didn't see the first time round and it scared the bejesus out of me. Like most scary movies the budget doesn't seem to be out of this world and the final few scenes look a tad corny. But overall very scary movi
1548,charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-movie,AmmonL.,3," Johnny Depp's characterization of Willy Wonka looked bad to me in the previews, so I just saw this on video. Be warned: if you didn't like Depp's Wonka in the trailers, you likely won't like him anymore after seeing the movie. I've heard Depp's Wonka compared to Michael Jackson in his mannerisms, and that's an apt comparison. They both seem very odd, and like someone you wouldn't want to have your children around- even supervised. Aside from Wonka, the Oompa Loompas aren't fun, the songs are forgettable, the adults are brainless, the children are pretty decent and so are the squirrels, but not enough to make this even an average movie-going experience."
1549,left-behind-2014-movie,YorkMan,0,"There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie. NOTHING! AT ALL!! The story is simple, perhaps a little too simple for anyone who finds the religious rhetoric completely meaningless, something this film does nothing to appease. Essentially the plot revolves Nic Cage's character, Rayford Steele (No, really, that's his name! The Captain of a passenger aeroplane), and his fiesty, precocious, teenage daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomas). During the opening narrative it's made clear that Ray isn't an especially nice person, he's sleeping with one of the air hostesses and actively lying to both his wife Irene (Lea Thompson) as well as Chloe. Irene is shown to be a devout Christian during the scenes in the Steele household, replete with iconography and Bible, and it is clear the marriage is effectively over. Ray pilots his plane into the air, whilst Chloe takes her little brother Rayford jr. to the local Mall. All Hell breaks loose (pun intended) when all the children and several adults just disappear, leaving their clothes/belongings behind. The same thing happens on the plane too, leaving mothers distraught and everyone in a state of shock. What follows is an hour or semantic religious nonsense as those in the air try to rationalise the events as the Rapture, whilst those on the ground quickly resort to looting and adopt a survival of the fittest attitude. Law and order effectively break down, and Chloe has to defend herself against the marauding herds. Eventually Ray approaches the airport (having turned his plane around mid-flight to come 'home'), but air traffic control doesn't seem to be there. Instead Chloe (chatting to her father via their Mobiles) manages to McGyver up a runway using an unopened stretch of freeway and lighting it up so Ray knows where to land. The film finishes with Ray, Chloe and the other passengers lamenting on what's been lost, but also announcing their undiminished spirit by saying they'll rebuild. It's hard to define what this film is. If it's meant to be a serious drama, using Religious metaphors and the idea of the Rapture to suggest Christianity still has a place in any modern, progressive, Democratic country.... Then it fails, badly.If it's meant to be a comedy, using over the top performances and a sensibility you can't take seriously.... Then it fails, badly.It's not like the acting is good, everyone in the film is terrible. Nic Cage doesn't even give the audience one of his 'Patent-pending' freak-outs, and this is a film in which the narrative would wholeheartedly support one (or two, or ten!!).The sets are pathetic, the outdoor sequences are badly lit, the score is forgettable...But it's the Direction which is worst of all. Whoever directed this film should never be allowed behind the camera again.Nothing looks right, no set-ups are done well, even the action scenes (which the Director could have just lifted the camerawork from better films to try and replicate them) are devoid of both scope and any sense of belief on the audiences part.There's no sense of fear for the characters, no suggestion their 'danger' will lead to their deaths etc.... It's just bad in every single way imaginable. Anyone who defends this film will fail, unless they are religious zealots for whom the idea of 'faith' transcends logic or any other defined faculty of the mind."
1550,chappie-movie,xolve,2,"Oh COME ON;this film has a heart but it's obscured by:The Constant product placement for Die Antwoord,the terrible acting by Yolandi (less-so by Ninja but still flat)bad script,implausible plot points on every conceivable level.Literally the only thing this film has going for it is a killer musical score and great special effects.But even that can't save it from mediocrity.This feels like a student film trapped in a AAA-movie's body, and the blame rests with Blomkamp."
1551,pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales-movie,chess123mate,3,"Note: I really like the first four movies.This movie is missing what made the previous ones great: somewhat complex plots where different characters interact, each with a different motivation. Jack usually interweaves between these motivations with cleverness, negotiation, and some planning. However, In this movie there was no complex plot, the plot didn't make much sense (and contradicted some of the things implied or stated in previous movies), and everyone except the evil antagonist ended up wanting the same object (and to use that object in exactly the same way, making them all allies against the antagonist). Jack has always had scenes where he cleverly plans an escape or series of actions (often surprising bystanders with his ingenuity), but there were no such scenes in this one. Jack sometimes did things that were inexplicable, but these actions were never proven to be particularly intelligent. (Possibly it was meant to be humourous?) Jack spent almost the entire movie imprisoned, tied up, or being chased - unlike other movies, Jack spent almost no time leading anyone anywhere (whether directly as Captain or indirectly as adviser/selective informer).I found the antagonist to be distasteful. He seemed to be on a murderous rampage, not caring who got in his way. The story suggests he got a really powerful ship (before being cursed), but it didn't make sense to me. Several ships attacking his all at once should have left a dent, but didn't. The antagonist and his ship, crew, and animals that just happened to be in the area are all cursed for entering an area - but whenever anyone else enters that same area, no curse is applied. After the curse, his ship had strange abilities that make you wonder why these ""curses"" are always such blessings if you want to be the perfect murdering machines (their abilities were more powerful and varied even than Davy Jones's!) Whereas Blackbeard valued little life other than his own, this captain seems to be thrilled at the idea of killing anyone he deems his enemy (with what I perceive to be inconsistent morals).There were no significant twists in the plot - it told you almost everything that was going to happen near the beginning; the rest just followed through. The plot revisited William Turner, and showed a number of things about his condition that don't add up with what the previous movies implied. What happened to Will's father? Didn't William have a job to do, that - if he fulfilled it - he wouldn't have any fish-corrosion on him (as Davy Jones did)? In the beginning, isn't William in command of the Dutchman - so why did he act like the crew was going to do some evil thing to William's son (who was visiting)?Minor notes:-I saw it in 3D, but found that the 3D didn't add anything to it.-The music was fine; they managed to keep the same type of music while varying it enough from previous movies to be pleasant to listen to.-A lot of the characters from the previous movies didn't show up in this one (and Angelica was implied to be involved in future movies based on the ending of the 4th, but wasn't).-I didn't care for most of the ending (too much death for my liking).Overall, the scenes didn't make much sense and very little of it was enjoyable. The beginning few scenes were fun, but they failed to introduce the elements needed to make it a good movie. As one who very much enjoyed the previous four films, I do not recommend watching this one."
1552,this-film-is-not-yet-rated-movie,Riren,8," This movie raises some great questions about our movie rating system and the needlessly shadowy MPAA organization. However, it has some problems of its own. George Carlin discusses our societal problem with enjoying fictional violence and prohibiting fictional sex in his stand-up comedy with greater depth and maturity than a dozen of these directors and producers do in actually discussing it for the film. Almost the entire first half of the movie is devoted to a parade of writers, directors and producers complaining about getting a gratuitous rating for showing a sexual act or semi-erotic behavior - This Film Is Not Yet Rated gets redundant quickly for far too long on this matter. They save the really compelling problems for use in small doses, such as Gunner Palace's R-rating; it was a documentary about what real soldiers are doing in Iraq, that got an R for drug use and profane language. It is much easier to sympathize with a director who is just trying to show the American public how their soldiers work and relax than it is with a director who complains that she wasn't able to show a graphic threeway in her comedy, or that he was chastised for having a girl pick up a bottle with her labia. Several of the things the documentary defends are juvenile, and it's kind of funny to see the film makers be so defensive about it. The Pentagon's possible censorship of war movies gets perhaps 60 seconds in this 95-minute movie. Movie ""piracy"" gets maybe 90 seconds. The cliche of violence against women gets a semi-humorous musical montage. Yet there's plenty of time to watch the lesbian private investigator talk about her life, sit in the car on camera on stakeouts and play phone tag - this is time that should have been invested in a meaningful discussion of issues raised in the film. The film's biggest problem is the MPAA, the organization that creates and gives ratings. The MPAA is too secretive to have contributed much in the way of interviews, and so it is blasted and jabbed at Michael Moore style. Certainly after the movie they seem to have deserved this treatment, but a thinking viewer can't help but be disappointed that most of what we hear about the MPAA is speculation as to their activities and motives. The most clever part of the movie documents its own submission to the MPAA for a rating, though much like the rest of the film, this part is more entertaining than informative - voices are ""re-enacted"" to give antagonistic tones, cartoon faces are used to characterize board members, conversations are cut making the director look sympathetic, and so on. Still, for the information the film provides and all the questions it raises, it's absolutely worth seeing. You may even want to make a checklist of all the topics you'll have to discuss afterwards. It definitely provides more of those than your average movie, or even your average documentary."

Music was super dramatic while what was happening on screen was nothing worth mentioning. Music alone is not enough to make a scene dramatic or deep, it has to be a combination of both.

1555,ghostbusters-2016-movie,ClockworkSlave,0,"First things first, I've watched it and its mediocre at best, but knowing that they didn't even attempt to respect fans of the originals is what makes me dislike it more. They have basically taken the Paul Feig formula that he has established with the heat/spy and copy pasted Ghostbusters on top.So instead of making a ghostbusters for fans, they made a ghostbusters for fans of  Feig movies.Imagine if they made a Spy sequel and instead of using PF/MM they got new actors/director and made it with a totally different tone and humor? tell me then if you would be upset as a fan wanting more of the same.I have no problem with him making his films (i will never watch them) but ppl are entitled to enjoy what they like.I wished they would have thought about what GB is first, then tried to make a good movie that fans would enjoy.If it was good enough it would have found an audience, as well as pleasing existing fans. The whole racial/misogynist angle Feig and co have been using as a deflection is a joke. maybe 1% are real trolls and misogynist, but they cant honestly believe the other 99% are all  with no real concerns.It annoys me the amount of disdain they had for real fans, why they felt they needed to stomp all over its legacy.Look at SWFA, while it had some problems Abrams really had respect for the fans. They looked closely at the originals and cast the original actors while writing 'NEW' characters. The lead being a women was great and she fit the part, was no misogyny fan blow back.  Its was a SW movie first and foremost.Fans could see a genuine effort was made, and while there was gripes, it was nothing to do with Daisy Ridley being cast. Bottom line, there is a PC SJW agenda in the media/hollywood at the moment (and gaming too)And they will claim its because they're progressive, but being this heavy handed, smacks of twisting the knife and  stirring.If they genuinely had the best interests of female actors (all women in general) they would look to find the right people for each job, instead of shoehorning copy pasting. Overall, they only have themselves to blame for the way the Internet has hit out at the clumsy way they handled everything.Misogyny didn't make the GB trailer the most DV ever..........Colombia/Feig did."
1556,tell-no-one-movie,EricL.,3," Watching or reading a Good Mystery should be like watching a Good Magician: you know you are being cleverly misled and relish the challenge of seeing through various feints and slight of hand to put the puzzle together. But mysteries only delight us when we know that we were given a fair chance--i.e. that the clues were there all along, but we were fooled despite our best efforts. Tell No One never gives the audience a chance: its like hearing a 7 yr old tell a story and realizing midway through she's been making it up off the top of her head (and has now lost the pt entirely). While the film's opening is terrific, once Canet force feeds Jeff Buckley's otherwise gorgeous ""Lilac Tree"" (at twice the film's normal volume), any discerning viewer will began to suspect a fraud. It goes downhill from there. I'm honestly shocked at how easily duped most critics (and apparently some viewers) are: the script isn't complex; it is incoherent. And with the exception of a few chases, the editing is merely confusing; not beguiling. A last pt: the film shows how easy it is to get good reviews simply by flattering the political and aesthetic sensibilities of film critics. Perhaps the most annoying thing about Tell No One is its smug and lazy liberalism (I say this as a life-long liberal). No wait: even more annoying is its preening, self indulgent and entirely uninspired musical score. You get the feeling Canet spent more time figuring out which songs from his 1990's mix tape to use than figuring out how to convey a fairly complex mystery novel in the space of two hours."

However, that's the only good thing about the film. Baumbach struck out for me again. I hated Margo at the Wedding, and while this was slightly better than that film. It was still bogged down with so much complaining about getting old (which seems to be a predominant theme in Baumbach's movies), that I couldn't enjoy it. I actually think most of the actors did a fantastic job, but in the end, it is the screenwriting and the directing that is a monumental fail for me. Nothing redeemable about this movie."

The dazzling visuals and epic battle scenes are the things to watch Gladiator for, and not for its simple premise. I will admit though that the dialogue was sharp and well-written, and the acting was pretty good (except Phoenix: is performance was wooden and clichéd). The movie could've been better, but director Ridley Scott is laughing at anyone who bashes it, Oscar in hand."
1560,shutter-island-movie,GusM.,10," Great thriller. Unexpected ending. Some people leaving the theater said the movie sucked, but the majority of the people left asking questions. What I took from people asking so many questions, was a great movie. When you leave a movie and can't stop thinking about what just happened. You must have liked the film. Leo gives another solid performance and the rest of the cast was good acting. Sir Kingsley made you want him to fail so badly, being the bad guy."
1561,lars-and-the-real-girl-movie,beingryanjude,10,"By its end, one of the most satisfying films ever made. Lars and the Real Girl is certainly a modern oddity - with feelings we all possess and share. Ryan Gosling vividly portrays a character which we grow to love and care for deeply, despite any peculiarity. It's blasphemy to not have given Gosling that Oscar nomination."
1562,crimson-peak-movie,DConroy,2,"As with all Del Toro films its fantastic visually.  Everything else fails.  Pacing is incredibly slow, the plot is incredibly weak, and its twists are telegraphed from the start.  Whats worse is character development, I never really care for the girl enough to hope she survives, nor do I fear or loath the antagonists enough to be frightened of them."
1563,the-bourne-ultimatum-movie,JaredC.,10, The Bourne Ultimatum never quits. It's paced with extremely high ranked action sequences and intense drama moments. This episode of Jason Bourne totally rocks and owns the first two.

1565,kiss-kiss-bang-bang-movie,Lambo442,0,"Couldn't get pass the first five minutes of this gimmicky nonsense. It jumps from scene to scene, from plot thread to plot thread so rapidly, you completely lose any sense of continuum. The narrator addresses the viewer directly, which is jarring and takes you out of the fictional world, reminding you you're watching a film. It's also very unbelievable and hohoho Val Kilmer plays a gay man - how novel and funny. The first scene he's in involves another man discussing his gayness with him, just a hint of the hijinks to come. The Nice Guys looks like it will be much better than this pretentious crap."
1566,twilight-movie,JakeJ.,1," Well, it sucked. The only thing good about the movie was that it managed to be better than the book. Except, even this triumph was unintentional: the script is so awkward at points I ended up laughing out loud at the most random, inopportune times. If you are a teenaged girl, however, you will love the movie. Shame on you."
1567,waltz-with-bashir-movie,DroogD.,3, Wonderful animation ... and incredibly boring.
1568,monsters-movie,mattsmash,8,A superb film. Beautifully shot and completely absorbing.  Be warned though this is not District 9 or Cloverfield.  The 'Monsters' are not in fact the aliens that lurk in the background of this movie but the humans who relentlessly try to blow them out of existence.

1579,we-bought-a-zoo-movie,MajorBob,8,"""We Bought a Zoo"" is the feel good movie of the holiday season. Before you go to see it be aware that it is rated PG; Matt Damon is not the Jason Bourne Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson is not the Nola Rice (Match Point) Scarlett Johansson or the Christina from Scarlett Johansson from ""Vicky Christina Barcelona.""The real stars of this movie are the animals at the run down zoo that Damon's character buys and Maggie Elizabeth Jones as his 7 year old daughter, Rosie. Ms. Jones will break your heart and make you want to take her home with you. The story is uncomplicated and predictable but it still works. Ms. Johansson works her usual magic on the male protagonist but in this movie its rumored that he spent more time in the hair and make up chair than she did. The supporting cast is just fine and the pace of the movie is much better than I expected. The moping teenage son shattered by his mother's death slowly comes around with the help of a teenage crush, the zoo gets opened and everyone has a smile on their face as the credits roll. This movie was made for movie lovers and not for the critics and award shows. Enjoy it for what it is; 2 hours and 15 minutes of light-hearted, feel good entertainment."

1581,room-2015-movie,FilmPhonic,8,"“Jack”, a five year-old boy, discovers the majesty of the world as he escapes the confines of a small room where he’s spent his entire life isolated from the world with his “Ma”, only to deal with reality and the emotional consequences of their extraordinary ordeal in this moving adaptation of Emma Donoghue’s award-winning novel. ‘Room’ is one of those films that’s difficult to review without spoiling some of the plot, but we’ll try to limit any narrative giveaways to what you can glean from the trailer. An Indie gem that’s already making splashes on the awards circuit, ‘Room’ is a faithful adaptation of a book that’s inspired by the notorious Josef Fritzl case in Austria, where a man imprisoned his own daughter for decades in the family home basement and with whom he forcefully fostered several children in captivity. Narrated and told from the point of view of young Jack, ‘Room’ retains a remarkable innocence and sense of wonderment in the face of darkness as Jack discovers the everyday things we take for granted and which he believed were an imaginary construct of “TV Land”, all brought to life brilliantly by an extraordinary performance from young actor Jacob Tremblay. The heart of the film is made whole through Brie Larson’s superbly nuanced performance as Jack’s “Ma”, a young lady who manages to somehow create a nurturing environment within a seemingly endless nightmare, only to be confronted the emotional battle that comes with adapting to a world of independence while being anchored by a boy who both depends on and nurtures her. Made all the more poignant by the fact that she has in Jack, both a reason to live, and a constant reminder of her harrowing ordeal. With evocative source material and a steady hand, director Lenny Abrahamson has crafted a simple but incredibly effective little movie that’s a perfect example of the best of what independent filmmaking has to offer. The Bottom Line…‘Room’ is a small but perfectly formed little flick in a big wide world, a multilayered indie gem that’s remarkably touching and life-affirming but never over sentimental, from a director that’s fast becoming a worthy representative of the independent movie industry."
1582,buffy-the-vampire-slayer-movie,Necromus,3,"So I was a huge fan of the TV show which was awesome and has basically nothing in common with the original movie, except having a teenage girl named Buffy whose destiny is to slay vampires as a Vampire Slayer. This movie was so boring, I literally, fell asleep 15 minutes into it. I woke up 15 minutes from the end and surprisingly it didn't seem like I missed any of the plot to me. I asked the group of friends I saw it with what I missed during my hour or so nap, they informed me that I hadn't really missed anything lol. My advice is just stick to the awesome TV show, which was cheesy but great because it didn't take itself seriously (it poked fun at itself and its characters from time to time) but had great character development, drama, and brilliant writing in the later episodes (The Musical episode was great!). As for the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie well I am giving it a 3/10 since that is the highest red review I can give it, since I slept through most of it I will give it the benefit of a doubt that there was something worth watching that I missed during my snooze."
1583,transcendence-movie,francisrgo,2,"Such a terrible movie. The film had no concrete story development and lacked character depth. It was borderline preaching. I understand that in modern society we are consumed by technology and we loose interactions with everyone around us, however, the movie clearly also shows how humans are like machines. They operate in one direct order and no clear understanding of one another. It also doesn't value how some technologies can actually help."
1584,son-of-the-mask-movie,sonicphoto,2, Son of the mask just doesn't quite cut it with the absense of Jim Carrey and the fact that is more based on the kid's crazy stuff then the actual mask. Is not a bad thing but some jokes feel old and overall the plot and story are too bland. Kids could find good things here and there but teenagers and adults won't find that much enjoyment on this one.
1585,moonrise-kingdom-movie,FilmEqualsJoy,8,"The Royal Tenenbaums is one of my all time favorite films. I love Rushmore as well. Those films are both 10's in my book. Moonrise Kingdom is not a 10. It does not live up to Rushmore or Tenenbaums, but it certainly comes close. The beginning of the film was my problem. I wasn't bored, but I was starting to get to that point. The middle of the movie then came and from that point on it was flawless. I enjoyed it very much. The performances from the cast were hilarious. Especially by Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, and Edward Norton. They are the funniest and saddest characters of this story. This is a story about young love and family and it is definitely one of Anderson's best. This is one of my favorite films of the year,  and I encourage any one to go and see it. One of the most interesting movie going experiences of the year."
1586,district-9-movie,PeterT.,0," I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would bother to watch more than 20 minutes of this unmitigated mind raping dross. What sheer fun it is to watch a video game, normally interactively played, unfold lazily before your very eyes with the same absence of storyline, acting or logical resolution to its various silly plot points. An allegory to the the human drama know as apartheid? If it was an allegory to that, you surely wouldn't want to set it in Johannesburg would you? that's like making an allegory to Nazi Germany while filming a tale set in Nazi Germany.... This kind of stupidity doesn't bother anyone anymore? Aliens who eat cat food as an allegory to drug use? Do all you ten-voters also still watch Sesame Street or something? D9 is nothing less than a completely farcical and generic action fodder hailed as the second coming of Christ featuring the most nauseating and lazy style of filming known as mockumentary with actors bereft of any professional acting skills and a script which is roughly made up on the spot with an f-bombs galore to hide the fact that the screenwriter signed off when he was told to quit being such a pain in the butt. ""It's only a movie man!"", or so he was told. No, no one is bothered by this. We turn off our brains as we laud the FX puppeteer for serving us yet another upgrade in CGI rendering as we cry ourselves to sleep from the joy that is living in these blissful times where real emotion is thankfully replaced by bandwagon hype and comfortable contrivances that won't occur in real life anyway. How terribly complacent it is to not have to worry about an actual sensical three act structure when you've got all this marketing budget to throw around allowing you to already cash in on the prefabricated acclaim and Pavlov conditioning of the crowds way before the movie is even actually screened. Seriously, why bother making the movie at all? Oh wait, I almost forgot, they never actually did..."

However, A Clockwork Orange is a portrait of modern day rebellion and the reality of life."
1593,anger-management-movie,theNILE,0,"Heard a lot about the film when it came out. The thing is much of the script is great, the acting is great, the general plot is great... This movie was ruined by the slapstick comedy, since it was so serious at some points, I would of just rather had a more serious movie. I genuinely felt sad for the main character. I'm sure a lot of homophobes are scared of trans women, but really, the old ""oh hey, I'm a girl... NOT"" thing isn't funny, if anything it's disturbing and downright tasteless. A few scenes were incredibly rushed and its glaringly obvious."

I thought movie would have an actual ending to the series without anything else but it ended up controversely opposite. A lot of useless dialogues we don't actually need to hear. A little humor scenes which actually don't suit the movie. And then all those ""AGENT SMITHS REFERENCES"" breache in and make it just funny and silly. I don't like those parts a lot. Keanu looks like he does need to get retired or smth. Now to the pros. Good angles, good camera work, it's actually nearly perfect except for mirror room scene. Keanu seems to push it to the limit. This movie is OK but it's not something like OH HELL YEAH. It's become more stupid-friendly. Leaves much more to desire."

1598,green-zone-movie,J.R.H,10," Gotta give it a ten because it's political. Some critics compare it unfavorably to Hurt Locker for that reason Hurt Locker let us know that there is still room for the Good Cowboy -- out there in the wilds of Iraq -- inscrutable, deep, superior competence with things that hurt and kill, solitary like Shane and Hondo, misunderstood by lesser men, killer of faceless, bad by definition, Natives, moved to affection, compassion and honor by young boys, seems in some deep way to know why the Wild West and the Desert Sands are ours. If we have a man like that there, how can it be Bad? So clearly, Hurt Locker was not political. Green Zone's politics are its MacGuffin. That we were lied to is unfortunately old news, but the action is fast, the lines are not bad -- Damon's a very good soldier."

The characters aren't even in a maze despite it being called ""Maze Runner"" and being a continuation from the follow on. The start of the film drags too much compared to the first start of the film which was a fantastic start and kept you guessing."
1605,do-the-right-thing-movie,AndrewBurge,10,"I'm pretty sure I forgot to breathe during some parts of Spike Lee's 'Do The Right Thing'. Not only because the way it penetrates the mind and soul of any sensible viewer, but also because I felt ashamed by the approach I took to this movie. With a stunning Public Enemy soundtrack, I expected this film to be a Black Power Movement propaganda. Was I wrong!It is 1989, a 32 year-old black man decides to make a film about race and discrimination. His approach, though, is as impersonal as it gets. He fills a Brooklyn Street during a single steaming hot summer day with every single racial representation of American immigrants. There is a Korean grocery store and an American-Italian Pizzeria, ran by the father Sal (Danny Aiello) and his two reluctant sons Vito (Richard Edson) and Pino (John Turturro) all set in a neighborhood dominated by African-Americans and even Latinos. There are no heroes and no villains among them.The plot is far from your average structure. It manages to deconstruct and implode upon itself in a slow and procedural manner like few films achieve. By keeping the location small, Lee succeeds in presenting us all the characters in a great, great level of detail, unraveling the hatred and subconscious cultural manners and views that are in every one of us through slow and wise writing and directing. Lee often lets these characters express themselves in a unique approach which I have never seen in any other film. Often they would be filmed from the front, and in a brilliantly executed subtle transition they would talk about themselves and their beliefs as if the entire film would decompose and it was just you and them. It is this technique alone, which allow the very essence of their personality to be revealed.There is a scene, in which Lee lets nearly every character spew racial slurs, almost signaling that through this hot day something waits to happen! And it does. It all builds up after Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) claims that among the Italian heroes there should be pictures of some 'black folks' on Sal's Pizzeria, to which Sal disagrees. From this rather banal issue, Spike Lee created a sprawl of hatred which ends in tragedy. But, it is not the issue which fuels the hatred, but it is the self-loathed delivery of their characters, each of them believing their truth to be the truth. The only exception is Da Mayor (Ossie Davis); an old man filled with regrets, wondering around the streets like a preacher of sorts. But, in the end, he is the only man which transcends race and eludes true love to all the characters, even though most of them despise him.In the end, Spike Lee's 'Do The Right Thing' is more than just the racial infighting that has been present since the dawn of man. It is also about the real and harsh acceptance of the fact that given the smallest catalyst, man will engage in chaos and violence, and also how important leaders are, from Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X to the humble so-called Mayor."
1606,mary-shelley-movie,GinaK,10,"I really enjoyed this film, partly because it does a very good job of re-creating one of my favorite periods in British Literature – that of the Romantic poets (Byron and Shelley in particular) – without being too serious and scholarly (and dull). It also provides an interesting take on how the novel “Frankenstein” came to be written. As an extra added treat, it also brings some insight into the origins of Bram Stoker’s Dracula via the publication of “Der Vampyr.” The film is reasonably accurate, is extremely well-made (acted, directed, etc.), and is just a lot of fun. Ella Fanning is particularly impressive since she gives a lively performance of a difficult role – she makes Mary Shelley a believable human being in the middle of a period movie and creates someone today’s audience can understand and sympathize with."

Seemed like everyone was reading their lines...for the first time!  The story was hard to follow, maybe because their wasn't much of one? Full on blows to the face without a drop of blood made the fighting seem fake, despite the grunting.  Maybe fans of martial arts will enjoy it but it seemed monotonous after a while.  And what is with that murky yellow cast to everything in the beginning? Didn't help.   I am a fan of the MI-5 series on Netfilx and thought this would be like it.  I was sooo wrong."

1613,big-bear-movie,colehrogers,8,"What defines a “good” comedy, is a films ability to create and maintain a plot that viewers can relate to or even “get behind.”  This unique quality is used brilliantly in Joey Kern’s new comedy, Big Bear, staring Pablo Schreiber (Orange is The New Black), Adam Brody (The O.C.), Tyler Labine, and Archery Knighton. The film, perfectly depicting a bachelor party gone wrong, throws you never ending one liners and witty comebacks that are guaranteed to make you laugh and maintain an interest. The most admirable attribute of the comedy was its ability to be outrageous and comical and still lead to a realistic resolution of self-discovery and forgiveness that conclude the movie. The dry and sarcastic humor that keeps the film inexplicably unpredictable is more than satisfactory. I thoroughly enjoyed Big Bear and highly recommend watching with friends!"

Like the stereotypes he guns down deserve a second thought. Duvall &amp; Bening tried, but Costner's Dances-With-Dorks character is increasingly more than I can stand.

The kids in the audience who'd gone for a bathroom-filling bear had clearly had an absolute blast, the elderly members who'd gone for nostalgia purposes were left with big smiles on their faces, and those in between were chattering away about their favourite bit. It's a really nice film with much slapstick humour (as seen in the trailer) but has the heart one would expect from a producer of the Harry Potter movies. There were moments when tears were shed (particularly on a windswept rooftop) and eruptions of laughter with Paddington's escapades and Julie Walters particularly stealing their scenes. There are a handful of moments that don't quite fit: Nicole Kidman's villain is a bit one note (although she's clearly having a ball playing the part) and Peter Capaldi (side note: fantastic Twelfth Doctor in Doctor Who) as a slimy neighbour doesn't fit seamlessly into the plot, but otherwise it's a joyous film and well worth seeing."
1622,only-god-forgives-movie,oliver1h,2,"Vithaya Pansringarm is the batman of Thailand in this insipid, ""art-movie"" wannabe, from Nicolas Winding Refn. Objectively this movie is laughable with unrealistic characters, and violence (Refn wanted it to look realistic, but it is exactly the opposite). The plot is not much to talk about, basically a boring revenge scenario. The visuals are nice, dream-esque, but nothing new or nothing that would add to the content of the movie. I think most good reviews are very pretentious, but go see it, and decide it yourselves."
1623,carrie-movie,GOTG_2014,3,"Carrie (2013) is one of the worst remakes with, A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) i don't know why this got remade, and this remake of Carrie doesn't add anything new , the biggest flaw in this remake has to do with the ethereal beauty of its leading ladys, Chloë Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore."
1624,superbad-movie,KoryN.,2," Not very funny. Not very good. By the way, Kevin R, b e's grammar in that sentence is correct (I opted to see the movie and my friends opted to see the movie = I and my friends opted to see the movie)."
1625,gi-joe-the-rise-of-cobra-movie,DanM,10," Smart and sophisticated. This is a deep layered work, much like Joyce's Ulysses, and as i have only seen it twice i have yet to fully digest it, that said I know two things for sure 1) this movie is a water shed moment in the history film 2) this is the most culturally significant film since Birth of a Nation. 1) this film takes a bold new steep in genrabending and has carried it out flawlessly creating a new way to invision film making. The Coens brothers have made stumbling steps toward the dream that Sommers has realised, notably their adaptation of McCarthy's No Country, but where other directors have only fumbled at what might be, Sommers has created it as Wells did before him. This is film at its best as it speaks to the human condition through multiple perspectives to better understand man and his place in the world. With Joe Sommers has done the seemingly imposable task of genrabending Syriana and Team America into the next citizen kane. The layers of these two gernas intersect in so many ways that a life time could not uncover all the conections, no one man could ever complettly understand this film and it is therefore criticproof. There is no doubt that this film has raised the bar for what a movie can be, film studence every where should burn their colections and focus on the future. GO JOE! 2) not since a birth of a nation have a people been forced to reconsile their future with their history by cinema. that is until now. Joe mutli perspectival aprouch raises so many questions what it means to be American every one who sees this film will be forced to examin there fundamental preconceptions. This film has held up a mirior that we as a people can not look away from. what has been seen cannot be unseen, and we must now move forward as we did after the decoration of independents and the civil war and redefine ourselfs as a nation. We must know once again who we are, and knowing is half the battle."
1626,the-danish-girl-movie,ednacaldeira,10,The Danish Girl portrays beautifully the struggles of the very first trans-gender person. It's an absolute masterpiece. Eddie Redmayne managed to touch my soul and come to understand fully any trans-gender out there. Although i'm not keen on the way Alicia handled Gerda i'm still blown away by her performance. From costumes to scenery everything is marvellous an the aesthetics are on point. Amazing movie.
1627,the-twilight-saga-eclipse-movie,NatalieS.,10," I happen to like it. Isn't the point of watching most movies is to be in another place &amp; to try experiencing something different? Alot of people don't have perfect lives, so to crash down on something that gives some hope is not very nice!!"
1628,marie-antoinette-movie,SteveK.,0," I go to movies to be entertained and I can find artful movies entertaining, BUT this is an excruciatingly boring movie. The pacing is so terrible, it pains me to even think about it. Sophia Coppola went for art and instead we got this self-indulgent piece of trash. I feel like there could have been some greatness here, but there is only so long a camera can linger and re-visit inanimate objects -- dresses, food, pets, jewelry, before causing everyone to slip into a deep coma. We get it! She lived a life of excess... We get it! They wasted lots and lots of money! And she still wasn't happy... WE GET IT! I don't mind the modern music... but there is no proper way to say that this movie is bad without using the word ""trash"" multiple times. Trash."
1629,act-of-valor-movie,BAT,10,"Someone once asked Chuck Norris what he thought of David Carradine as martial artist.  Chuck replied that David was as good a martial artist as he was an actor.  So true but for those of us who rightfully respect the skill set that these men posses, we would rather see Seals acting as Seals than Tom Cruise acting as a Seal."
1630,tideland-movie,JayK,9," I can't believe how underrated this movie is. The lack of respect this movie gets is really a crime. This film is extremely brave, interesting, well-written, well-acted, well-shot, and well-directed. I was captivated the whole way through. If the back of the case appeals to you, please do give this film a shot."
1631,disturbia-movie,SteveP.,8, Great thriller! Had me on the edge of my seat. Absolutely unexpected shot at the start. Builds tension superbly and there is enough character development to make us actually care about the characters.
1632,king-kong-movie,Sidiot,0," A movie only an idiot can love? What was to like? The unoriginal story; the terrible acting, a lame script with more holes than swiss cheese; or the editing that never took place? Peter Jackson is in love with himself as that's obvious. Boring and ludicrous."
1633,the-devil-inside-movie,smijatov,3,"Well, there is no way around it: this is yet another really bad horror flick. And, to an extent, as any horror, it has some interesting concepts that can induce fear. Or if not fear, at least thoughts of it. But that's about it. The cinematography is poor, as is the directing, and the acting is even worse. Screenplay has been written rather clumsily and it just does not work. Why give it even a 3/10 then, you say? Well, I am not sure myself. I guess it's my personal weakness for exorcism films. Or it's just trying to be generous, for some inexplicable reason. Maybe the devil has possessed me, and is making me do it. That would be more scary than this film... Go figure."
1634,despicable-me-2-movie,Rox22,9,"Despicable Me 2 loses a bit of the elements that gave the first movie its charm. But, it also adds a whole lot new. This movie works perfectly as a sequel. It shows how Gru has moved on and is adapting to fatherhood, while still retaining his zany lifestyle (sorta.) DM2, seemed less funny than the first movie, but also had much more heart and depth. In other words improving on the formula. Overall:Despicable Me 2 is a fantastic sequel and allot of fun to watch."
1635,the-lego-movie-movie,Yusuke,0,"Everything is awful! The Lego Movie is one of the most terrible movies released ever and makes me physically angry. Society (both young and old) have been praising this appalling movie for the humour, the story and the amazing CGI animation, however this was a huge let down in the end. The animation was similar to that of the stop motion from the past. This animation style just felt awful to watch and fell short of expectations that were given from the praise it had been receiving. Objects were added and removed from each frame obviously for effect but it just felt very clunky and was an eyesore. The action scenes were a headache to watch because of this as they were too fast and erratic. There weren't many action scenes either, and for good reason too, as most of them were un-entertaining. The story was completely atrocious in the way it was portrayed. The film opened surprisingly as it begins very abruptly. The audience and I try to catch up with the plot although already being tossed straight into the story. The humour and wit in this film is dreadful and was dissatisfying to say the least. The jokes were presented to the audience horribly as they were constantly repeated. This caused the audience to become disengaged in the humour after approximately twenty minutes into the film. No one in the theater even laughed at any one point in the film either, instead there were just smiles or small giggles and these were gone by halfway through the movie. The references to aspects in modern society were also short-coming as they were overused just like the jokes. There were many references to characters and icons of pop culture in the twentieth century from many superheroes, to Shaquille O'Neal, and to many others. Most of these references must have been used as a joke because there were very few that were even used to advance the story or even be included in the story. Instead they had their short moments or one liners, or even just their single appearance. The appearance of Will Ferrell added some saving grace to the film for many but for others that might not be enough! There were far too many scenes in the film where the main protagonist and his blocky friends would just be escaping the place they currently were. The evil police man known as the ""Bad Cop"", would constantly chase Emmet Brickowski from one place to the other which just left people wondering, when it would end. Watching this film was physically exhausting as not only would they be dashing from place to place on the run, but there would be crazy story advancements and even flashy colours being thrown into the mix. Is this movie even well made? A love story beyond the ages, action that transcends all, and most importantly an intricate story-line? I don't think a single aspect of those were used in this movie and this left me wanting to leave the theater before the film was even finished. This movie was unoriginal and was a complete disappointment. I'm now going to go cry myself to sleep after watching this horrid film."

It seems that about 42 % of the site's active user population are actual fascists too stupid and/or dishonest to even realize it. That number is way larger than it has any right to be, but we live in a world where Donald Trump is the president of the USA.

Why would someone as talented and beautiful as Katherine Heigl want to be associated with something so low-class??? That, I could not understand.

1641,piranha-3-d-movie,WriteFilmLive21,0,"""Piranha 3D"" is sick. Just plain, straight-up sick. Instead of a simple, undercooked B-horror flick like I was expecting (I did not see any marketing for this movie), I was instead subjected to the most over-the-top and exaggerated ninety minutes of perverted adolescent pandering I've seen in my life. For the love of God, Michael Bay would be ashamed to have his name on this thing, and he dumped fat dead people down city streets in ""Bad Boys II"". When it's not insulting your genitals with shamelessly objectified nudity, or piranhas chowing down on penises and breast implants, it's bleeding your eyes with the most overdone gorefests ever manufactured on film. Am I really supposed to find humor in a bunch of spring break teenagers getting chewed, bitten, torn, ripped and shredded to the bone? Am I supposed to laugh when a girl breaks in half while being carried to safety, or when the camera looks over all the half-eaten cadavers? Am I supposed to be entertained when a half-assed villain devoid of any and all character or human relatability comes crawling onto a deck with meaty twigs for legs? No. Absolutely not. This is not entertainment, and it's disturbing to think that enough people were convinced otherwise to throw together this twisted piece of "

1644,underworld-blood-wars-movie,TrevorsView,2,"Good grief, more of this vampire and werewolf nonsense? When will this cultural obsession just die already?Oh, that’s right, never. Because apparently vampires are immortal…Well, after watching Underworld: Blood Wars, you will finally realize how unappealing immortality is. When a war between two mythological species has been going on for five films, don’t you think the two sides would have realized by now that neither one will win? After all, if the whole point of the mythology is that nobody can die, what’s with all the gun and swordplay?Those scenes of wolves getting mutilated and decapitated may just as well been the most entertaining scenes in this entire series, if you enjoy watching Kill Bill levels of gore without the artistry of the screen. I’m betting you two cents that the existence of this movie comes just for the strange world where guns and swords somehow coexist where vampires rule a democracy.The story makes just as much sense as the 2016 presidential election: Kate Beckinsale (The Aviator, Love &amp; Friendship) plays the highly motivated feminist lead who is out to find her daughter whose blood can end the war… and apparently she has this same type of blood too, which she’s trying to keep away from the vampire council who want to use it for abusive means… well, that was at least the plot I got out of it. There was not enough sense of mythology or coherent history for me to care about anything in this snooze fest.Which is sad, because the potential for a great story is there, if less time was spent sexualizing every woman on screen and more time showing us why we should care about any of the strangely attractive members of this futuristic (yet somehow historical) society.Well, maybe we should be giving this atrocity more credit, seeing how this is director Anna Foerster’s first attempt at a feature-length? …Nah. If I were to tell the world that this was my first achievement after directing a series of shorts, I’d hide my head in embarrassment. Seriously, Foerster has no idea how to stage actors, especially the teen heartthrob Theo James (Divergent). I’m serious- that guy needs to just quit acting. He has no future in this field.Foerster does have her moments of proving to be potentially good at this directing thing; as she includes a gorgeous view of a snowy landscape blanketed by northern lights, but it’s not enough to outweigh the incomprehensible fight choreography that takes the place of character development.There is nothing that Underworld: Blood Wars has to offer besides feelings of dark coldness, kind of like the unfortunate winter season we’re living through now. I have no idea who’s giving these producers enough money to keep putting on these wastes of talent, but whoever you are: STOP!"
1645,riddick-movie,StriderKiwi,1,"My God this movie was awful. Where to start? The plot is a ripoff version of the original, the pacing is horrendous and the movie is overly long. The dialogue and writing are atrocious. The acting isn't memorable. The action is bad and so is the directing (canted angles constantly for no reason). Riddick as a character is weakling who gets beaten up constantly and has a puppy, A FREAKING PUPPY for no reason at all. It's like the people behind this movie had no idea what a Riddick movie even was!? Save your cash and time."

Unless you saw the first Anchorman, you just won’t get it.” Well, I saw the first Anchorman, and I saw Anchorman 2—well, not quite. I walked out of the theater because the film was so offensive. Using racism, sexism, discrimination and low-caliber humor to try to make jokes was the film’s biggest flaw. The acting, set design and production are all fine, but whoever wrote this film made an enormous error in judgment. Almost everyone other than a white male will be horrified by the dialogue in this movie."
1649,by-the-sea-movie,allisonjane65,2,"Some movies simply don't deserve the scathing reviews they receive and others clearly do. By The Sea justly deserves the bad reviews it's been getting.

1655,the-neon-demon-movie,Jewels-PiXie,9,"Deliciously darkly decadent with any initial sweetness existing in the characters drawn away like a hungry needle giving blood.This visually striking masterpiece glitters it's way onto the screen with shimmering chimerical glimmers of sound and vision that transports the viewer to a place of elation and euphoria seemingly effortlessly ,in the blink of an eye.Elle Fanning's character is 16 and embarking on a modelling career.This is the height of visual  aesthetic lusciousness and psychological yumminess and it has a soundtrack that gets so far under your veins,that it will become your life support. Never has Heidi Klum's well known Project Runway phrase been more apt 'In fashion, one day youre in ,and the next, you're out.' And it is only the male gaze that decides whether someone is 'special'. Exploring the impossible man-made, mysognynistic ideas of  what femininity should be and how women and girls have become so obsessed with achieving this utopian ever-shifting image, an idea. In the flutter of Elle Fanning's fittingly doll-like eyes ,we see women talking in fairly high-pitched little girl voices,infantalised , glossed over girls ,all morphing into one gigantic combination of doll parts.Pricked and prodded surgically enhanced ,with the duality of natural beauty and cosmetic beauty ....? but somewhere along the line ,blink ,blink.blink and the lines become blurred. What length will we ,as women ,allow ourselves to go to, to achieve beauty.....This is sisterhood in a toxic ,ruthless ,enthralling stance.With a largely female cast (satisfying the Bechdel test) ,each as equally arresting in their performance as the next,and all are entrancing, in a superhuman powerful kind of way. A huge nod of respect to Elle Fanning, by Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote, Abbey Lee, the core of the cast.The collaborative writing genius of directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, co-written by Mary Laws, Polly Stenham, and genius director Refn, the threesome that have created what in the duration of the movie becomes akin to Frankenstein's monster. It's a Freudian ,Lacanian's dream. Woman representing the phallus ,that fallacy dreamt up by the whole Oedipal Scenario, where in attempts to attain the high stakes of this paradox it's every girl for herself and beauty and ugliness spar like you have never seen before. Lustrre and radiance dance together before us in a way that has the sort of addictive imagery of Kubrick and then some. Majestic riches and sparse scenes are reminiscent of a Miles Aldridge post-modern photoshoot. Lies become the truth and the truth becomes a lie, pop will eat itself and heartbreak shatters a cavernous headspace that will leave you bereft.A thought provoking , compelling, statuesque monster of a psychological thriller.Cinematic excellence."
1656,rise-of-the-guardians-movie,TheQuietGamer,8,"DreamWorks once again proves it knows how to make an excellent looking animated movie while still maintaining the clever writing that brings the laughs. Surprisingly enough this is not only a movie that your kids will enjoy, but you will as well. Once again DreamWorks assembles some big names to create another astounding voice cast. The writing is excellent providing an great plot and tons of humor. It manages to harness that childish energy that reminds us why these fictional characters are so loved, and how much fun and joy it brought to believe in them. Animated kid movies rarely get much better than this outside of Pixar, but DreamWorks proves that it has what it takes to stand along side them."
1657,munich-movie,WillieG.,8," This film was executed rather well. This is precisely the sort of serious subject matter Spielberg should stick with at this point in his career.

1671,scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-movie,skaiser,7,"In short, a 2+ hour movie often with a fast forward Schizophrenic like pacing because of the amount of material they had to get through, with a bunch of what the general public will see as ""obscure"" references. I salute Edgar Wright's attempt to cram 6 books into one movie as if he knew a sequel was highly unlikely for such a bold Indie project, however choosing such a fast pace does effect the movie in bad ways, the main reason being it limits the appeal of an already unique movie even more then if the story had the time of a sequel to develop. Scott and Ramona as characters suffer the most from the pacing as the movie almost completely removes the book story aspects of addressing their pasts, coming to terms with their mistakes and the new responsibilities of adulthood, reducing Scott to little more then a Jerk Jock and Ramona to little more then an indecisive whore. It's the biggest flaw of this movie, what we get instead is characters typical Hollywood style, the main characters magically becoming better people by the end of the movie with little explination and it's I think one of the main reasons for so much hate towards the movie because they have basically watered down the entire point of the story. True the movie is still crammed to the brim with bold in your face visuals, Anime/manga and videogame references at every turn, when it's not overdone like the pointless peeing scene it's an impressive sight to behold, but it's assumbing you can actually recognise the references to appreciate them. For casual movie watchers who have no idea what hadoken, frag, kawaii or other similar lingo means, the movie will leave them scratching their head in frustration around barely even 10 minutes in as they try to follow the fast paced story. The only way they could possibly connect is reading the books first, which I consider a failure, as the film should be able to draw audiences in on it's own merits. No matter how you feel about this movie, it's doomed to a 'cult classic' fate at best, in some ways similar to twilight, but with a fraction of the movie goer profits, which is a shame because the Scott Pilgrim universe has more depth then those glorified vampire romance fanfictions. If Scott pilgrim vs the World is 'self absorbed', then by that logic the Twilight Saga thinks it's the greatest love story ever told."

From the very beginning it was going so fast it wanting to start the movie but it just got boring from then on. I might not be on the right here or where are my facts, well the fact is, the movie is boring, bad, bland and it's just a terrible. ""The last knight"" it's like five seconds of telling who it is but doesn't explain it after that. They probably do, but I wasn't listening because it was so freaking boring. The writers are terrible, who asked seven writers to tell this story. Each will have their own say and just give it to Bay like,"" Hey we just got a new scene to put in the movie can you put it in?"" He do, and then theres all these other writers wanting what they want. It just a mixture of everything that goes nowhere. Megatron is horrible, this part is hilarious though, they tried to make a suicide squad movie in it and it could've been more interesting then the movie that I was watching. Please watch something else if you can, if you like these other kinds of movie, then go ahead this is only my opinion. You might ask, ""Why go watch it if you know it's going to be bad?"" Well  I try to open my eyes and see how things can improve if it doesn't then here I am. Bad movie! Bad directing! Bad acting! Bad editing! Writing and Film in total. Nothing has improve, it's all the same."

1679,foxcatcher-movie,ydnar4,8,Foxcatcher is all  about the performance. The main cast are all incredible. Steve Carell pulls off what is certainly a performance of a lifetime for a man who has been known for comedy roles. Carell may not win an Oscar for  this film but it did earn him his first nomination and its hard not to cheer for him as the Oscars approach. Mark Ruffalo also received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Dave Schultz but its Channing Tatum who surprises me out of the whole cast. Tatum shows that he is certainly capable to of a serious role and he doesn't always have to be a big box office draw. I read Mark Schultz (who makes a cameo in the film if you know his story see if you can point him out) biography prior to watching the Foxcatcher movie and sure it does not necessarily follow the most true story but the film is still effective. The film was a lot darker and more thriller like than I had expected as I figured it would be more of an intense sport film. The ending of course is a pivotal part of the film and I will not give it away but if you are unaware of the Foxcatcher story it will likely shock you and I think that is why this film has gotten such critical acclaim because its a true story that many people are completely unaware of. If you're a fan of sports movie I would maybe sit this film out because it certainly not full of action but if you want to see some amazing acting Foxcatcher is a film for you.
1680,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,tigs77uk,0,"Not only an awful movie in it’s own right, but an absolutely Terrible Star Wars film. If you are a true Star Wars aficionado you will hate this movie with a passion that can only be matched by the Phantom Menace. Established canon is ignored and Luke Skywalker's character is butchered beyond recognition by Johnson. I spent the entire movie waiting to see ""Jedi Master"" Luke kick dark side butt and although Hamill gives a great performance even he can't lift the absolutely terrible story Johnson has written for him. I very much agree with Hamill that I fundamentally disagree with every choice he made for Luke's character. For gods sake Rian, didn't you think it might be a good idea to listen to a man who pretty much IS Star Wars? For a movie with so much potential you are left feeling that Rian Johnson made a list of the top 100 ways to infuriate the fans and included every single one into this absolute pile of dross. Sure its funny in parts and the Porgs are cute as a button, but despite a good performance by Ridley, Rey's character is yawn worthy and appears to suddenly be gifted the powers of a Jedi Master without any kind of training. Given that the Skywalker family are more or less born of the force and none of them could magically attain their powers this seems like utter crap and will leave you frustrated and despondent. I was so looking forward to Luke ""passing on what he has learned"" but Johnson somehow didn't seem to think that this was necessary either! The casino scene is utterly pointless and reeks of the over the top CGI nonsense of the Prequels. Rose is also an irritating and unnecessary character who does as much to ruin the film as Young Anakin did in Episode I. I actually wanted to slap her after the line ""Now it’s worth it"" As if those creatures are actually going to go free. The bad guys have speeders and starships you stupid girl! Johnson didn't seem to know what to do with Finn's character and seems to have written in a totally arbitrary side story just to give him a part, which is a shame as I loved the chemistry between him and Rey in Force Awakens and there was so much opportunity to develop it further in this movie. In fact on reflection I agree with many other fans that this movie is as bad a Star Wars movie, if not worse, than the prequels (maybe not episode I) and really sticks its fingers up to the established canon of the original trilogy and the expanded universe as a whole, which in my view is absolutely unforgivable. Since when could blue glowies interact with normal matter! And are you really suggesting that a Jedi Master as powerful as Luke Skywalker supposedly is could magically die just because he was projecting himself using the force... Utter utter  No expanded universe author would get away with doing this so how has Rian Johnson been allowed. When are Disney going to learn not to fix what ain't broke! Snoke is killed off far too easily and its frustrating beyond belief that we don't learn his identity (I think all the fans were hoping for Darth Plagus which would have tied in beautifully with the prequels and explained how there was suddenly this ultra powerful Sith Lord floating about) The chase between the First Order and the rebel fleet is ridiculous beyond belief, ignores the laws of Physics and leaves so many plot holes that you will find yourself bored and frustrated, since when were Mon Calamari cruisers supposed to be so fast? and why is it that Medical Frigates and other support ships seem to also be magically gifted this power just by virtue of being associated with them? Whilst its truly great to have more strong female characters and I would have loved to have seen more of ""Jedi"" Leia, Vice Admiral Holdo is arrogant and incompetent and you are left feeling that she is a ""stupid woman"" rather than the strong female leader they should have given us. Mon Mothma would never have been so arrogant or idiotic! The whole escape could have gone much more simply had she just revealed her plan from the get-go instead of pointlessly frustrating Poe. How dare Rian Johnson call himself a Fan! Please Disney don't let him anywhere near the Star Wars universe ever again. The critic that claimed that this movie was just as good as Empire should be taken outside and shot for getting our hopes up. Comparing Irvin Kershner's masterpiece to this utter nonsense is nothing short of blasphemy."

1682,mission-impossible---ghost-protocol-movie,Blofeldploy234,3,"This is one of the most overrated movies ever made. The fourth Mission Impossible continues the trend of the film series showing disrespect and drifting away from its source material both totally and thematically in favour of meaningless action sequences which make more sense. Speaking of action, let me start off by saying that I found these ""amazing"" action scenes pretty underwhelming. After every car chase, fist fight or gun fight it all left me thinking ""that's it?"". The gadgets thus time were more ridiculous than ever, it made Die Another Day look real. As for the story its the same old meaningless generic nuclear war  turning USA and Russia on each other, only this time it's poorly done. it starts off with a Kremlin bombing which has no sort of impact on the world. The world is on the brink of World War 3 and nbdy anywhere gives a damn. There's no sort of political crisis going on following the bombing. In Dubai nobody cared, in India they were partying all the way. The Sum Of All Fears played its WW3 story much better and that movie was a dud. The characters, including Jeremy Renner were very boring and wooden. Ethan Hunt continues to be the most overrated spy in the world, he's got nothing on James Bond or Jason Bourne. The villain was idiotically generic, his motives are incoherent and dumb, and he was underdeveloped. Like I previously said, this is generic  The movie felt more like a commercial for the new BMW than it did an actual movie. Overall rating 3/10."
1683,little-miss-sunshine-movie,TimW.,9, A movie about six nutty people caged within a dysfunctional family and a clapped-out van. I loved it. And if you liked Sideways then you might love it too.
1684,suicide-squad-movie,gameguardian21,8,"Im going to be honest here, I really liked this movie, and do I hate critics for disagreeing, no because it is just an opinion. Lets start off with the characters, deadshot was pretty awesome, not just in action, but in character development. He was also really funny and probually one of the most relatable characters in the movie. Harly quinn was fantastic in this film. Not only does she have the feel and humour of the character from the comics, but she was had moments that really surprised me. The joker has serious potential for the little screen time he had if he's in the new batman solo film. Side characters are good, but some just don't get enough development. The story has it's flaws. Somtimes, it doesn't explain why the characters are here, and its plot is just a simple this person wants to take over the world plot, but at least they explained the plot in a pretty funny way. Speaking of funny this movies jokes are pretty funny, with it adding more fun to the dc cinematic universe. The action sequences are also entertaining to watch. And when it comes to character motivation, it's much better than batman vs superman. I feel as if why the characters are doing what there doing makes sense. Overall you may like it, you may not, but think you should definitely check it out to see what you think."
1685,x-men-movie,MrMovieBuff,10,"It's one thing adapting a single superhero onto the big screen, Richard Donner achieved this very well with his ""Superman"" films, and Tim Burton also did a respectable job with 'Batman' (1989). But to adapt a superhero ensemble film can be tricky as there are so many characters, and so many powers to focus on. How can this be done seamlessly? The answer can be found in Bryan Singer's 'X-Men', a movie that is carefully paced, has a strong, coherent narrative focus, and utilizes every different character to their best. The movie starts in Poland in 1944 during the intense age of the Holocaust, we see a young boy separated by his parents, and he tries to reach out for them in both sadness and anger. He discovers that he is able to bend the metal gate that was separating him from his parents, we know he is Magneto. A mutant that can control anything made of metal, or anything with metal inside it. We cut to present day and meet a young teenage girl named Marie (Anna Paquin) who is hanging out with her boyfriend and when they share their first kiss, he begins to feel weak. We know that she is to become Rogue. Telepathic mutant, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) is presenting a keynote about how mutants should not be the victims of discrimination, and we also meet Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is trying to reason with an old friend, Erik aka ""Magneto"" (Ian McKellen). Erik believes that there is a war raging between mutants and humans, and wants the humans to fail as they have mistreated him in the past due to his mutant abilities. Rogue runs far away from home and meets an animal-like mutant with the ability to heal fast, and has sharp blades that extend from his knuckles...his name is Logan aka ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman). After getting into an accident, mutants Storm (Halle Berry) and Cyclops (James Marsden) take them to Professor X's school where Rogue will be educated and safe from discrimination, and Wolverine can learn about his past origins that he has no memory of. Meanwhile, Magneto has planned to kidnap Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) and teach him a lesson about discriminating mutants. Magneto, and his apprentices which include; Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), Toad (Ray Park) and Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) have developed a machine that, with the right mutant and their power, will have the ability to wipe out the population of the city. The movie moves at a fast-paced, and at roughly 90 minutes, it seems too short. But, there is enough to see here, we understand the story very well, and director Bryan Singer, along with a talent cast, are able to craft an energetic, fun, thrill-ride of an adventure. The characters all blend together quite well, and It feels very grounded from time to time, almost realistic, as it does tie into history which we see from the beginning. Also, the way it has this social commentary on how it deals with discrimination and out-casts, mutants are more than just harmful beings, or straight-up spandex superheroes, they're people too. Singer has made them as sympathetic as possible, and this is an example of a comic book movie done right."
1686,dallas-buyers-club-movie,seadaawg,10,"I loved everything about this movie. It is well-acted, the script and direction are great. Continuity is flawless, to my eye, but I was so taken with the acting and the story that I wasn't really looking for flaws of that nature. I like that McConaughey was not really presented as a hero, but at the same time he has tremendous strength and impressive personal resources. Leto was amazingly good in his role. I also felt that I learned a lot about the history of medications for AIDS, as well as homophobia, without the movie being tiresome or boring in the process. All in all, a very impressive piece of film-making."
1687,under-the-skin-movie,Robertchuckman,10,"I took mom to see Under The Skin yesterday.  Aside from the explicit sexual themes, disturbing imagery and nearly wordless plot progression, bringing mom was a good idea. After all, she’s into a good sci fi flic, likes Scarlet Johansson, and she enjoys wrestling the kind of difficult, challenging ideas put forth in this film. Plus the promise of gorgeous views of the Scottish countryside really paid off, which was perhaps what mom liked most.What mom didn’t like were actually the things I did. This film allegorically describes and criticizes male and female relations, focusing on how women are driven to treat men brutally. The film is a visual metaphor, criticizing ruthless femininity, oppressive institutional forces, sex and beauty as power, as well as the restoration of femininity and our humanity.This film’s ideas and plot are moved along almost entirely without dialogue. It might be tough for some viewers to follow this story told through images, but I’m sure it’s even more challenging to tell a tale in this way. This film, however, does this almost flawlessly and one feels led by capable hands in this regard. Many of the scenes not only move the overt story forward efficiently, but also engage the audience to consider the films sub -text, which revolves around issues of gender relations in our society. The story and characters are therefore a means by which to discuss these difficult matters, things which people rarely talk about. Its lack of dialogue might almost be viewed as saying, “social discourse rarely touches on such things…” This film, then is the best kind of sci- fi, because its ideas are relevant for our use today, and is commenting on important human themes.The film opens with an unknown man stopping his motorcycle in night, walking down to beach and retrieving a lifeless female body. He deposits it into a van, and in the following scene, Scarlett’s character is seen assuming the identity of this lifeless woman by removing the body’s clothes. This turns out to be symbolic of removal of the body’s skin as well, because we find out that Scarlett’s character is an Extra Terrestrial, who uses the guise- and skin- of a beautiful young woman to do her job. Her object on earth? Seduce single, young men from the open window of her van, in the night , bring them back to her abode, coax them to follow her across the magical, mirror-like, watery floor of her bedroom until these men are submerged and disappear. Once the victim is submerged, she puts her clothes back on and goes back to work.. Three men into this ritual, we see the awful fate of the victims: their insides are sucked out from them, leaving only the skin, with their innards shipped off to somewhere….This horror, we come to discover, are guided at least in part by the crotch- rocket man. His influence is not fully understood until the beautiful female ET accidently picks up an ugly man to bring to his doom.  Upon receiving the ugly man, however, the spell of ruthlessness and murder is broken, because she feels the humanity of this character. She has compassion for him. Unlike the others she seduced, who were out partying and having fun, this man is walking at night to buy groceries, simply hoping to avoid the hateful judgment of others. Though he is grossly deformed, she comments on how nice his hands are and the man begins to weep. Ruthless devotion to her intent is destroyed by this man’s innocence, ugliness and humanity. Coaxed to the watery pit, she frees him suddenly. Thus begins her journey to restoration.Because she spares this man from her deadly pursuit, the crotch rocket man now chases her. She cannot be allowed to stop being ruthless, let alone pity someone who is ugly and outcast from the brutal game of beauty and power. She must not find her own, and others’ humanity. She escapes into the beautiful Scottish country, and the wild interior of her own nature. She is taken in by a kind man who makes her dinner and invites her into his home. They go for a walk, and one beautiful image is of this man carrying the ET across a large puddle, evoking the haunted, watery mirror which she used to destroy the men she met in the past. They go back to his house and they eat. Upstairs, he kisses her and they begin to have sex. When her hymen breaks, she recoils, unprepared for the pain and vulnerability of her humanity. Fleeing, she takes refuge in a cabin in the forest.  After being lulled to sleep by the endless span of nature, like a baby in a womb, she awakens suddenly, remembering the peril she is in because of the crotch -rocket man. Running, she finds an empty logging truck, tries to steal it but is seen by its driver, who chases and then attempts to rape her. Through this assault, her shell is ripped and the man staggers back, horrified by the sight of her true inside. He runs off and as she walks away, the rest of her false skin falls off. Now the ET is fully revealed: Dark, feminine, beautiful, strange…unspeakable. As she looks down and comes to see this part of herself, the trucker has returned and murders her. Her wild, interior nature is certainly not allowed to live…only devotion to the brutal game of falseness and exteriority can survive. She is left a smoking char in the snow after being burnt alive.This last sequence of events demonstrates the power of the allegorical nature of this film. The idea that women are driven- through male-dominated, institutional forces- to carelessly seduce and even to destroy men is difficult and nearly unspeakable. Scarletts’ ET is initiated into a state of compassion, humanity and the interiority of her being, the one thing that cannot survive."

This was a childhood favorite of mine so take my score with a great grain of salty nostalgia. I still want a blue heeler because of this movie. Instead, I have a puggle. He's pretty cool though. I might have come to love the post-apocalyptic setting because of this movie, now that I think about it."
1694,guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-movie,RoyGolan,10,"Positive+ Interesting plot but a bit simplistic.+ Very funny, even more than actual comedies.+ Great character development. We learn more about all the characters, their past and their motivations.+ Amazing visuals.+ Good action sequences.+ Baby Groot is very cute.Negative- The main villain looses his recognizable face, making it harder for the viewer to feel him as the bad guy.- Yondu's arrow is much too powerful, a way to solve any difficult situation. Feels almost like cheating.Great movie. Might not be as big as the first but still very entertaining.5 Stars"
1695,immortals-movie,Rewo,3,"Not a bad movie, but not good either. Full of cliche scenes and hillarious costumes, also the 3D effect wasn't the best (even commercials before the actual movie were way better).

1696,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,sL360,1,"Perhaps the biggest tragedy of a Star Wars film to ever grace the cinema, and that's really saying something considering Attack of the Clones is a thing. Where to even begin..I'm not about to launch into a scene by scene tirade, as many fans before me have done the same in a much more eloquent fashion, but I will say this: The Last Jedi fails in EVERY aspect of good film-making. It is a beautiful looking, million dollar turd. The plot zig-zags back and forth meaninglessly, the characters, shallow, unrelatable or insane. The  they do MAKES. NO. SENSE. NOTHING in-universe makes any sense any more. Logic is completely thrown out of the picture. TLJ embraces pure, stupid emotion resulting in:- A laughing stock of the First Order, completely unintimidating and generally useless villains. Hux somehow hasn't been executed or at the very least relieved for his incompetence and Phasma has zero presence. She has no reason to exist other than to give Finn a shiny glorified punching bag.- A purple haired lesbian (yes this is part of her character because reasons) admiral who spouts drivel about faith while apparently having no faith in any of her crew to tell them the plan to escape the bad guys, dooming literally all but a small handful of them to a merciless death. She utterly fails as a leader and yet the movie pretends she's the good guy all along by turning her into a kamikaze pilot in perhaps the prettiest yet dumbest scene in all of Star Wars.- A deranged psychopath that claims fighting what you hate isn't how you win, despite earlier on her own sister doing the EXACT OPPOSITE AND WINNING, while simultaneously watching her hated enemy preparing to kill all her friends. Her enemies can do this as a DIRECT RESULT of her own actions. (How have the rebels not keeled over already with people like her and purple hair in it?! Oh, right. Incompetent villains unless when it's convenient.)- A menacing, all-powerful antagonist who is actually neither powerful or menacing and dies in the most pathetic way possible while monologuing about how unbeatable he is- The most uninteresting, aimless and actually all-powerful protagonist who by the word of Yoda has no need for training, trials or tribulations to succeed, she need only exist and her problems will solve themselves- A broken, dejected cast of old, respected characters who are shown to have lost all hope and just want to die sad and alone after having turned into a complete joke of their former selves. Luke Skywalker, legendary sci-fi hero turned suicidal hermit is probably the worst offender of the bunch. Not even Mark Hamill has any interest in returning for his role after this crap.The Last Jedi gets one point from me because there is only one thing I liked; Kylo Ren's throne room fight. Yes, the guy who has callously killed untold numbers and his own father is the only one I can root for..incredible. Unfortunately he's the only one who seems to have a pulse in this film. There is nothing else salvageable out of the nuclear crater TLJ left in its wake. In one movie Rian Johnson killed what made Star Wars. How is this possible? From the get-go, this is someone who has been quoted to say he would ""be worried if everyone [thought]"" the movie he made ""was a good movie."" He would prefer half the audience hate the movie and the other half love it and he finds this prospect ""much more exciting."" Despite this, Rian has deflected every piece of negative criticism on his creative 'vision' like he's the Van Gogh of Hollywood. He seriously believes The Last Jedi is excused from any critique...NONE of it is valid according to him. Is his egg-shaped head filled to the brim with that much hubris? He also apparently believes that if Empire Strikes Back came out when social media existed, it would've been roasted to hell and back because Luke Skywalker ""..gets his ass handed to him."" by Vader. (Only if you made it, Rian..Only if you made it.) Someone with this mindset was given ""complete creative control"" over the cultural juggernaut sensation that used to be Star Wars. I simply do not understand how Disney could screw up so hard. We fans are not impossible to please; Tickle our fancy right and we'd have dropped hundreds of thousands on you just like we did with George. Instead, Disney and its peons have opted to directly insult their own consumer-base for their failures, pushing for some 'toxic masculinity' or 'anti-feminist' nonsense. REAAAAALLY SMAAAART.I no longer have hope or an interest for the future of this series. This is the last SW film I'll ever pay to see as long as Kathleen Kennedy is head of Lucasfilm. A colossal waste of talent and potential on all sides. The dream is dead, and it seems like Kylo was right all along. Time to let old things die, isn't it? Kill the past if you have to. (Ridiculous line..) I'll miss what Star Wars used to be but I've no regret over ditching this sad, soulless continuation."

1699,redbelt-movie,SteveR.,1," I cannot believe how badly this film misses the mark. Mamet brings high expectations. This film has chasm wide holes. People who betray at the last moment. People who disengage for no reason, people who slap and love with no investment. If not for Ejiofor and Alllen, this film was atrociously written and poorly acted. Mamet's worst effort by a wide margin and inexcusable given his knowledge of the subject. Randy Couture stutters every first line. What a fiasco, and I cannot believe the Metacritic score, i have never been so far off. 20 years from now, some films rise and gain cult status, mark my words, this will gain Showgirls status."
1700,the-wave-movie,Brent_Marchant,7,"A rather formulaic disaster movie but one that's redeemed by outstanding special effects (and not an overreliance on them to carry the story, either). The film could have benefited from some judicious editing during the setup to the big event and in its aftermath, as well as a few less preposterous sequences during the tragedy itself. Nevertheless, this is generally entertaining fare from an unlikely source, filmed in a beautiful setting with gorgeous cinematography and stunning catastrophe visuals."

1702,godzilla-2014-movie,thisseatofmars,2,"The title, ""Godzilla,"" is misleading because it implies this is a movie about Godzilla, or that he's--somehow-- the lead. Godzilla, the King of Monsters himself, ladies and gentlemen, shows up for about 20 minutes of screen time in this 123 minute clunker. Much of the film is padded out by boring, BORING, super-one-dimensional characters and their boring friends and family: specifically Ford Brody (can't act), Joe Brody (can't act) and Elle Brody (for God's sake, woman, eat a hamburger!) This movie shouldn’t have been called “Godzilla.” It should’ve been called “The Brody’s” or “Ford Looks Up Stupidly with his Mouth Half-Hung Open for Ninety Minutes While the Audience Texts and Moans Audibly with Boredom.” This film is a serious disappointment, as I love the Godzilla series, King Kong, and Kaiju movies. Do you know who else loves all these wondrous repositories of imagination? The great Guillermo de Toro. Please, please do yourself a favour and go see the much superior and joyous ""Pacific Rim"" instead. Seriously, go and watch it. There is a movie that honours Godzilla, and handles the material properly: with love."
1703,sorry-haters-movie,KenM.,8," To think this movie tries to say something profound about 9/11 is to profoundly miss the point.

At a time when most movies are based on existing IP or fail to explore any theme, here is one that is an original story idea and that is about interesting thematic ideas. It deserves to be a new Christmas Classic.If you like This is Us on NBC or It's A Wonderful Life, check this movie out. If you like movies and shows about positive emotional growth and relatable human emotions and experiences, you will enjoy this. I wouldn't be surprised if audiences discover this movie on video or television and realize how great it is, much the way both Shawshank and It's A Wonderful Life were discovered after theatrical release. Why critics celebrate bleak films like The Revenant and Hell or High Water (both of which are not about relatable experiences) and yet dismiss movies like this as sentimental and manipulative is baffling to me. All art is by design manipulative; it is meant to elicit emotion in a very structured, calculated way. And this movie is not overly emotional or sentimental. It is just like Shawshank and It's A Wonderful Life in terms of emotions; that is, the emotions are earned and not melodramatic.The screenwriter came up with a brilliant script, and the director and actors realized his vision beautifully. Go see this movie in the theater, so that Hollywood will make more like it. Critics who have dismissed this movie know nothing about the screenwriting craft and how difficult it is to come up with an idea and story of this caliber."
1710,tracers-movie,WooxyWan,0,"Awful movie which damages the Parkour community in so many ways. Police/security will be hot on us more now, it doesn't show the true spirit of Parkour too.

1711,minority-report-movie,FilmQueen,9,"Extremely good! Very interesting sci-fi ideas with lots of action. The story is well-written and well paced. Also apart from the ""seeing into the future thing"" it's not a ridiculously non-realistic vision of the 2050s."
1712,bee-season-movie,DruQ.,1, The acting is excellent but wasted on this aimless waste of film. Whatever message is trying to be given is lost in the four separate actions of the actors.
1713,total-recall-movie,MonsieurEames,8,"Intelligent and action-packed, Total Recall is one wild ride. The whole project holds an air of mystery and the plot is packed with twists.

1715,the-hateful-eight-movie,Jacob,8,"The Hateful Eight is another example of Tarintino being a master filmmaker. Tarintino creates a distinct western that while to some extent is Reservoir Dogs in the west is so fine tuned that you won’t mind. With emphasis on his great dialogue, a verbal battle between various well defined characters, and well shot with the trademark Tarintino violence it is hard not to be engaged. The film is long but it is mostly justified. The only slow part is the first act, which while necessary could’ve been trimmed. Otherwise the film remains intense as you try and figure what will happen and who is lying and who is telling the truth. The revelation at the end provides rewatch value as you will see the film in a whole new light knowing what is going to come. If you can get past the intimidating three hour length you will find another master work from Tarintino. Hopefully, this isn’t his last film."

Did no one tell them that Star Wars was popular because people liked it as it was, that people liked the story, characters, and even the serious tone? Is it necessary to turn everything into a superhero movie full of bad jokes? Well, I'm sad for two reasons, first and foremost, I no longer look forward to see any future Star Wars movies, what made them special is not there anymore, and secondly, why all blockbusters have to be carbon copies nowadays? Where did imagination and originality go?? I can't believe that with all the money they have, they cannot do better. Clearly they aim for children and teenagers that will fangirl at the possible love lines. But even the children get tired at some point when you only offer cheap copy-paste."

I can definitely recomend to watch it for s heart, character, and a great lesson. Final verdict: 8.1"
1725,priest-movie,xGreyWardeNx,2,Priest was not a good movie. The plot was weak. The battles sequences were subpar at best. The special effects were nothing to write home about either. The movie also seemed to be quite short. I was disappointed because the previews looked promising....but it did not deliver at all. Should you see it? In my opinion.....no. But I am not you.
1726,kick-ass-movie,George-roots,7,"Having myself, dad &amp; sister read the book, It was one of those rare instances where we ""all"" couldn't wait to go see a comic book movie, For what probably is one of comics most strongest indie projects to come along in quite some time, and the fact the principle storyline only tends to sway apart in each different form of media, Kick-Ass magically works well on film, to an extent where this comic needed to be made into a film. The choice of actor's were fantastic, Aaron Johnson has slowly built up a solid career and actually delivers my favourite interpretation of Dave Lizewski, where Nicholas Cage and Chloe Grace Moretz deliver a truly cartoonish, macabre performance of serious vigilante's ""Big Daddy &amp; Hit Girl"". Christopher ""McLovin"" Plasse is awkwardly charming and funny and Mark Strong delivers a superb Crime Mogul. Overall, it's a fantastic looking movie, it's vibrant, colourful and extremely well choreographed, Without doubt you can see why the controversy is there, and true if I thought this movie was incredible I would have a lot more to say, But ultimately it really is a pop corn flick, the film is very self-aware and thank god because if this kind of stuff takes itself to seriously I feel it would surely fail. Final Verdict: Have an open mind and try to see the funny side, in a time where the internet exists and more and more we become desensitized to violence in pretty much every form of media. Kick-Ass has a welcome place among it bigger budget counterparts. 7.5"
1727,black-swan-movie,DRahaim,1,"Very Disappointed in this movie.  Yes the dancing and the Photography is good, but it takes a lot more then that to make an interesting movie.  My group found the movie tiring and the ending predictable.  The idea that anyone would cast such a fragile, timid ballerina in the lead of a major production  of Swan Lake in one of the world's premiere ballet companies is laughable. Dancing required hard work and discipline. As the movie states, it is a very competitive art. I do not think this character, who still sleeps in a room that was designed for a three year old would have ever made it past her first three years of dance, much less make it to stardom. She would have ""cracked up"" years and years before.  I have read the other reviews and ""know where they were going""...I just don't think they ever got there."
1728,rango-movie,dq72,2,"This movie is not really for kids.  It is a hard PG, bordering on PG-13 due to guns, violence and language.   It's not for kids between 3 and 10 and I regret taking my kids to it because now I have a lot to explain. There were a few laughs in the first 10 minutes and after that it was all explosions and shouting"
1729,seven-psychopaths-movie,Efrain,10,"Having seen and loved ""In Bruges"" Seven Psychopaths was one of my most anticipated movies. I'm happy to say its everything I had hoped for and more. From the opening, this movie kicks off with a great start having a very Tarantino style beginning. With such an original and great screenplay you can't go wrong. We than get introduce to our seven psychopaths.   The performances are great, Colin Farrell should stick to these small roles, more specifically comedic roles, before I saw In Bruges I disliked him as an actor none of his movies appealed to me. He works so well as the lead protagonist in this role.    This is probably one of , if not the best Sam Rockwell performances. He has played this crazy character before but its more effective in this particular role. He is unpredictable, the funniest and the best psychopath of them all with out a doubt the star of this movie.    Christopher Walken is at his best. If you just enjoy him in any role, you will love him in this. He plays the calm and wise religious man but very hysterical at times another scene stealing performance. Woody Harrelson is the enraged mob boss who will literally stop at nothing until he gets his little Sh-ih Tzu back. Tom Waits plays probably the most psychotic of them all. Everyone works fantastically well in this movie. I have not a single bad thing to say about them. The woman in the cast though, are basically eye candy.    Martin McDonagh is one of the best up an coming Writer/Director. If he keeps this up one day he may be considered among the best script writers of our time. This movie does have elements of Pulp Fiction where everyone is just having random conversations that sometimes end up with people dying horrifically. Yes, there are multitudes of gore involved in the death scenes. Everything is so unpredictable with plenty of laughs and flawlessly made from both behind and in front of the camera. Seven Psychopaths is another ""best of the year"" and the funniest film I've seen so far in the year."

1732,superman-iii-movie,Moviebuffreview,2,"While Christopher Reeve continues to soar as Superman here, the rest of the movie is nothing but a failed, crash landing.

I have been following the franchise since 1977 and it has always brought me a lot of happiness, even in JarJarBinks times. When I heard about The Force Awakens announcement I was very happy. The film has brought me great expectations of what every fan wants to see: our heroes doing what we expect them to do. The Force Awakens brought me this great expectation. But unfortunately, what I least expected happened and I was very sad and disappointed. I wonder what logic goes on in the mind of a director like that. Why do that?

It's poorly shot (only total amateurs shoot so much meaningless handheld:  it's easy to do and it's NOT how we see the world in reality!) with so many missed opportunities in the setting.  Not great acting by any measure with Laura Dern (always liked her) absolutely undeserving of nomination.  Subject matter sordid with bent toward druggie culture which this dirt bag amateur filmmaker tends to know most about.

1739,the-lego-batman-movie-movie,DavidTejada,8,"I'd like to start this review with a comparison: I think Batman's character is like Dory, they did a perfect-hilarious job when they were secondary characters (in The Lego Movie and Finding Nemo respectively) but if we're talking about as main ones (The Lego Batman Movie and Finding Dory) then they're still good but not as satisfying as the first one. Don't get me wrong, this spin-off was incredible and I liked it, who knows that maybe is going to the Oscars' animated feature now, but compared with the last one I think you already know my answer. Batman provides a powerful animation, good laughs-moments, thought-provoking ones, also the remarkable DC characters who we love (even it's charged with more surprises) and with good values as ""team work"". But the thing is that I felt it also a little bit forced, that's it. The good news here are that it was FAR BETTER than Batman vs Superman and it was a very pleaseant animated movie to begin the 2017's (75%)"
1740,hellboy-ii-the-golden-army-movie,JohnP.,2," I don't understand why everyond is giving this movie top scores. The character designs are definitely cool, but those are taken from the comics! The plot does not make any sense, especially towards the end where random characters shows up at specific places just to keep the story going. Character development is a joke and most of the main cast's reactions to their surroundings and to each other felt incredibly contrived, inconsistent and forced at times. There were some funny moments in the middle when the film sort of stops taking itself so seriously but overall the film felt absolutely robotic."
1741,spring-breakers-movie,Bruce722,2,"The critics hate almost every movie made but somehow actually liked this film? Wow, I can't say I'm surprised, those morons will give any artsy fartsy movie a good rating. The reality is that Harmony Korine made a terrible movie that has no actual point other than to show an unnecessary amount of nudity and tell a 45 minute story in 92 minutes because the movie repeats itself the entire time. The acting was actually fairly decent but beyond that why bother even watching? If you want to watch a handful of stupid girls make exaggeratedly stupid decisions in a film that drags and has no point, this is the movie for you. If you want to be entertained, don't bother."
1742,transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-movie,JuanV,10, The critics if anything should just get there garbage to themselves or better yet tell it to someone who actually pays attention to them like their family. honestly this is a great movie full of action and great computer affects i would watch this movie again and all my fiends have said the same. critics who hired them and whoever did should be fired along with them remember a movie is suppose to entertain you not bored and if you sit down and actually break down the movie instead of watching it then really get a life because that means you need to check in your brain in the door because your cant enjoy a movie and most likely you wont enjoy life. transformer 2 thumbs uo way up the critics as's lol.
1743,a-late-quartet-movie,DCEdmonds,7,"""A Late Quartet"" 10 Scale Rating: 7.0 (Good) ... The Good: Great cast that does not disappoint. Very powerful performances that make you forget that these are actors and causes you to start thinking that these are real people. Surprised that there was not more Oscar buzz for the cast, to be honest. I didn't have any interest in most f the subject matter, yet the film was able to keep my interest due to the depth of the characters. The Bad: As expected, can be a little slow at times. Also can come across as a little pretentious."
1744,the-core-movie,MollyC.,8," I really liked this movie. Sure, it wasn't as deep as ""Truman Show"", but it was gripping and the characters were better than in ""Poseidon"".

1745,pans-labyrinth-movie,JabbaOnCrack,10,"Bravo Mr Del Toro, Bravo! You have succeeded in creating an engaging, compelling feature, combining fear  and fantasy whilst exploring numerous issues including the deterioration of creativity as a result of exterior influences and the horrific impact of War. The acting is superb,Ivana Baquero is brilliant as Ophelia, vulnerable and inquisitive, her performance is frankly, worthy of an Oscar Nomination. Sergi Lopez is also brilliant as Vidal, Del Toro has effectively contrasted the respective natures of the two characters, Ophelia represents youth, creativity and optimism whilst Vidal is callous and violent. Del Toro's greatest success is the creation of Ophelia's alternate dimension. Stunning visual captivate a scene both beautiful and morbid. Del Toro has succeeded again in constructing a brilliant story from a concept that, without exceptional acting, set design, score and screenplay composition would fail to impress."
1746,there-will-be-blood-movie,SeanP.,10," It stunned me. 2007 had its share of great movies. I didn't think stuff like No Country For Old Men and The Diving Bell And The Butterfly could be beat, but this movie knocked me out like no other film from the last few years. Maybe even longer. The ending was over-the-top and bizarre, but it was also 10 minutes of some of the best one-person acting I've ever seen. Day-Lewis is spectacular throughout the whole film, but he just went all out at the end. A crazy masterpiece."
1747,the-mask-movie,Rox22,7,"For what it was when it came out, it was great. But, even in the 90s this movie was perhaps a bit too cartoony for its own good and could have used a bit more overall depth. Overall:The mask looks and feels like one long old school slapstick cartoon. It does have a few serious moments that suit the movie very well, but they are few and overshadowed by the comedy. Still, a fun and entertaining movie, a shame it wasn't more."

1750,prometheus-movie,beputty,2,A great visual spectral that does answer some questions that I never thought to ask about the Aliens films. However in my inability to watch previews I didn't know it was a prequel to the alien trilogy. On its own merit it is 2 only because it has awesome special effects. It has good acting and all the recipes for a great movie except for one thing it makes no sense and is complete dribble of information that makes you connect the dots from the alien trilogy. However if you don't know its part of the alien franchise then its a ridiculously bad. After about an hour I finally said ah ha its an alien prequel.  But until then it was slow with predictable tension that led to predictable outcomes.The key is By Itself its a waste of time. If you combine it with the other alien movies then it has some redeeming qualities and you could rate it significantly higher but only if you have a crush on the Alien.
1751,the-english-patient-movie,CuculizaO.,10," Yes, the movie is slow, but it's so beautiful that with some patience youc an really enjoy it. The performances are outstanding (you'll see what I mean in the last 30 minutes of it), specially from Mr. Fiennes. There's not much to be said about this that hasn't been said before, so I'll just recommend it. If you wanna see a big love traditional epic, I don't think there are many options better than this one."
1752,valentines-day-movie,SeanB.,8," While the movie did jump all over the place, I think its a great movie for singles, dating couples, and married people. It has powerful lessons on how to best find the right person for you, the consequences of being unfaithful, and that you have to love both the good and bad of the one you love. Most of all, the best message of the movie is don't rush in."
1753,transformers-dark-of-the-moon-movie,incline75,0,"This is one of those movies that assumes the audience are either 13 years old or just plain dumb.  The comedy seemed like it was trying to hard, and came across as bad jokes.  They added so many new characters, and yet not one were you able to connect with.  The dialog was so bad, and so uninteresting that it made you feel mad at the crappy writers.  75% of the action scenes were cool to watch."

1755,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Sevastior,0,"Rose is a worthless character shoe-horned in for god knows what reason and is more irritating than Jar-Jar - they killed the wrong sister at the film's onset. The casino arc is trash, if the producers really wanted it to still be in the film, they should have just made Finn and Poe go together and scrapped Rose. The grating humor is out of place in a film where the good guys are being annihilated. Jumping to hyperspace as a weapon goes against the very idea of hyperspace and if it is a viable strategy, why not have any of the support ships of the rebel fleet sacrifice itself with a droid pilot at the start of the film. For that matter, why not jump a ship into the first and second Death Star in the original films, the introduction of this tactic is completely unjustified and not well thought out. This film makes the events of episode 7 completely irrelevant and implies that no level of attack on the First Order will have any effect. Apparently, destroying star killer base did nothing but kill Han while causing no permanent damage to the first order. Why must we not see Luke performing any acts of true power, it saddens me that the chosen one who defeated Vader and the Emperor is relegated to mere astral projection as the extent if his power. Next Leia apparently has the force power to survive the vacuum of space despite no real previous indication that she could do more than sense some truths through the force. Please, this is 2017 how can the animation of her flying through space back to the ship be laughably bad. Why god, did they have to ruin Rey's back story - there were so many amazing options they could have gone with, but they chose to make her essentially and orphan (the most cliche and lazy back story imaginable). Why did we get the casino arc instead of a Rey back story? Next, how can the all-wise, all-seeing Snoke be defeated by such a crappy trick as that employed by Kylo?The only really redeeming parts of this film are those with the force link between Rey and Kylo, the scene with the dark side cave, and the fight between Rey/Kylo and the praetorian guard.All together, I fail to see how any critic with a ""developed"" cinematic pallet could say this is a good movie. This film is a disgrace to the Star Wars inheritance, and I can not imagine how a critic could think otherwise without having been bribed or strong-armed into a good review by the demonic Disney executives seeking to keep the film from tanking in the box office. The entire casino subplot is a worthless arc motivated by the typical Hollywood political sentiment that is incapable of seeing its own hypocrisy - like DiCaprio lecturing us on the environment while hosting birthday parties on mega yachts and hiring private planes. Lead by example you swinish, elitist, Hollywood hypocrits!"

NO, it is no tindependence day, it is way better and realistic.As with other reviews, the actions in this film is great and haunting. Go see this movie. You would not regret it.

Disney played them like a fiddle, keeping them away from the film until the hype machine was roaring, assuring that any critic who dared to speak against this joke of a film knew that they would be speaking out against what was sure to be the biggest hit of the year.  And the critics, just like the early viewing kids and teens, were just swept away by it.  Newsflash people:  A movie isn't good just because it gets a lot of coverage.  You need to decide if a movie is good AFTER you have seen it, not before based on the marketing.  That's what I did, and the actual quality of this film is zilch!  The biggest cash hit of the year is also the worst quality film of the decade.  Regarding critics, lesson learned.  They have lost all credibility."

Halle Berry makes this movie exceptionally convincing and delivers an emotional punch. I will warn you if you are suffering from anxiety you need not watch ""The Call."" So many times I shifted forward in my seat in suspense, while biting my nails. Now with all of the positives this film does shove a few pins through my heart. 3/4 of the movie excels as a thriller, but in a blink of an eye were running upstairs when we should be running out the front door. The thriller quickly turns into a horror film and this is where the film loses me. We are given a ""Saw"" ending?! As the director, Brad Anderson had everything going for him, but gives up on the ending and it is extremely disheartening. In a nut shell ""The Call"" is a fun, outlandish, and suspenseful treat that is worthy of a matinee ticket."
1767,let-the-right-one-in-movie,WJS,8,"Although based on a horrific premise, ""Let the Right One In"" is a beautiful film shot in a luscious style that perfectly capture the chilling undertones of the movie. It is violent and gory but doesn't dwell on that. It explores its horror through the real life situations of young love, bullying and loneliness. The two young leads are quite compelling in their performances and it's directed at a pace that perfectly complements the story telling."
1768,jack-ryan-shadow-recruit-movie,AlexanderLuthor,7,It certainly wasn't The Hunt for Red October but this was a fairly action packed and enjoyable popcorn movie.  Don't expect Oscar performances but not bad overall.
1769,x-men-apocalypse-movie,MD5774,0,"I finally got around to seeing this movie. This movie isn't in the same league as Captain America Civil War. With that said , this movie was terrible . I'm not a big comic book reader or anything like that , but I know Apolcalypse isn't 5""5 feet tall. What Tom Cruise is playing this character ? To let the older actors go and get these younger actors was a terrible decision . This is probably another worst superhero movie made again in 2016"
1770,midnight-in-paris-movie,makrtik2,9,"Who says they don't make 'em like that anymore?  This is a fun, sweet, interesting movie, with well realized characters... many of whom are beautifully portrayed artists, writers, and other well known celebrities oft he Golden era of Paris. This is a fascinating and sensitively rendered story of a deeply engaging and romantic era, contrasted with the almost universal lack of pizazz of modern times . Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein is terrific, as are many others in small by beautifully portrayed roles brought to life  by known, and not so well known, actors and actresses with bright futures. This is a movie to make everyone in it proud, and one that will charm you so deeply that you will never forget Midnight In Paris... it makes you want to  run away to the Paris of that bygone age... when just being alive was electric, and  life was so rich and intense that you were drunk on the joy of life; a time when global warming and outrageous corporate greed were unimaginable. Go early, so you can see it more than once before it leaves theaters. One of the few pictures in along time that was more than worth the price of a ticket... You might say that Midnight In paris is an over-night success."
1771,quantum-of-solace-movie,moviegrabbag,7,Not up there with Casino Royale but a great follow up to it. The acting was still great but the movie rushed through its self a little bit. Daniel Craig still does a good job and makes me forget about that Pierce guy. Overall a very good movie.
1772,elizabeth-the-golden-age-movie,DianeM.,8, Very enjoyable period drama. Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey R. are wonderful. Deserves a higher rating.
1773,robin-hood-movie,EthanPeter,1,"If it reinvents the legend at all, one has to wonder why the legend exists in the first place.  The story and characters are painfully boring.  You've already seen all this action before, and the elements it borrows were selected from the bottom of the barrel.  Watch Kevin Costner's again instead."
1774,blade-runner-2049-movie,ConorMacleod,9,"Blade Runner 2049 is one of the greatest science fiction noir films of this decade. It's rich with VFX and a narrative that builds upon the world and characters of the previous film. The slow burn of the runtime pulls off a third act that is just  awesome, and the filmmakers should be commended for their work."
1775,me-before-you-movie,hugosiq,10,"Exceptional! The film manages to touch us with its intense history, humorous and at the same time sad. It makes us cry, sending us a love story unimaginable, naive and beautiful. Applauding the protagonists and the whole team that brought us this brilliant work! Thank you very much. I'll watch often."
1776,the-thing-movie,Behemoth1993,0,"Now my friends I am going to be very frank with you. I am a HUGE; I MEAN HUGE fan of the ""The Thing"" both the 1950's ""The Thing Form Another World"" and MY ALL TIME FAVORITE ""John Carpenters The Thing"". Both of which put you in a situation where you can do nothing but sit and wait for death or do everything in your power to stop it. The 1950's the thing was much different then John carpenters and in all fairness was the best of the three. The black and white set for a creepy yet realistic feel making you visualize most of the gruesome and scientific aspects on your own; where as the John Carpenters The thing was a survival horror in which you can put yourself in the shows of the amazing R. J. Mcready (aka Kurt ""Motherfucking"" Russle. It gave you beautiful visuals, plausible science banter, and the fear of the unknown. This movie failed in every area its predecessors amazed. ""The Thing"" in this movie felt more like a necromorph from the fantastic survival horror Dead Space and is not as appealing. The story seems to push its self through rather then flow as John Carpenters did and did not allow for great character development like the 1950's original did. The characters seem like actors and not like people at all in the sense that you can tell this is a movie. The plot is filled with holes and seems like he had great ideas that didn't really link so he just put bits and pieces together to  try and make it flow but it was truly just all over the place and unequivocally bland. For those of us who have seen the two predecessor's in there glory know that what made us so enthralled with the cinematic extravaganza wast he fact that the alien was unpredictable; and in John Carpenters case the unknowing of who or what the creature was or its origin was just amazing and full of spontaneity. This was not achieved in the new version and kills the movie right from the start. From the start you know the alien has a form. This in its self left me with a retched feeling that the rest of the movie the alien will not think analytically, showing its superior knowledge, but that it is thinking more forceful and bold leaving no startling shocking feeling but instead you get a mundane adrenaline like nausea that you would rather skip then continue on with. The movie is no Alfred  or Guillermo Del Toro master piece and is not even worth paying twenty dollars for the blu-ray with a digital copy. this movie is the type you rent because you watched everything else on netflix or one of those movies you can pick up for five dollars at from a college student with a stand trying to sell dvds for money in Manhattan. I am both appalled they would butcher my favorite movie, but i am even more furious that they would dare, I MEAN DARE, try to link this to the John Carpenters version by trying to tie in Kurt Russel in a sequel or trilogy. This is movie for people with a low IQ and who care very little for the science fiction genre and just watch to see an ""Alien"". Skip this if you watched the predecessors they are WAY WAY BETTER and deserve more effort to watch then this garbage. Skip this if you just want a new movie and want to experience a good sci-fi because this if far from good and i can suggest way better movies for cheaper like IRobot, Gattaca, or The Fifth Element. Stay way from this if you are even given it for free because it is a glimpse of what will come in the future. That no matter how much the budgets have grown by, and how advanced the technology may be that is utilized, that in the end movies such as this atrocity are  going to be made because consumers are dumber, easier to please, and easily manipulated. All those foolish neanderthals who thought this was good have no credibility with me and obviously have no taste. Its true some people are just harsh and most people are looking for simplicity, but my friends use your minds and see this in nothing short of crap. In the words of my lord James Rolfe (aka the Angry Video Game Nerd) ""WHAT WERE THEY THINKING"""
1777,horrible-bosses-movie,TTW107,7,"So hilarious. The chemistry between everyone was just on point, it was a cast full of veterans making a great dirty rated R movie. I loved it, one of the better comedies of 2011."
1778,watchmen-movie,Tedcook,0," Sieve with microscopic holes, looks fine, but all the meaning just pours right through."
1779,turbo-movie,chaostheorem,8,"A movie about a racing snail? Yes it can be done (and it has)! Although you may have felt like you've seen something like this story before coughHerbiecough, there is a certain level of charm in watching an underdog trying to follow their dreams. Not just talking about the snail either. Some parts of the movie are a bit slow, and it takes awhile before things really pick up. Overall though, there are enough moments, character-building, and comedy to keep interest up."
1780,xxx-state-of-the-union-movie,no0n3,0,"I can't believe, that someone would spend money to finance creation of garbage. how can it get such a high user score on metacritic? 0/10 is too generous."
1781,woman-in-gold-movie,alexa417,10,"A highly recommended story about justice, the importance of family, and reconciling the past and present. Watch this movie online http://www.watchfree.to/watch-2a2e9f-Woman-in-Gold-movie-online-free-putlocker.html"
1782,king-kong-movie,Katherine,0," Why did they make ANOTHER King Kong? I mean it has been made about 8 times, and everyone knows how it ends. Kong dies at the end. So it's not like you changed it so much. It ends the same. So why don't the directors of today just stop taking other peoples ideas and be original."
1783,boyhood-movie,Beardfull1,1,"Booooooooring!It was like watching three hours of your nephew's life slide show.No plot, no script, no great acting... Nothing!I gave it a 1 cause it takes a lot of guts to film something so forgetable for 12 years!!!"
1784,pans-labyrinth-movie,DaveR.,2," Am I the only one that hated this film? It had some interesting visuals, but my huge gripe was the characters were completely lacking in depth. Really, all you needed to know about anyone was whether they were a Franco Fascist (bad guy, boo!) or a Red (good guy, yay!). The plot was contrived and arbitrary; the obstacles had no logic other than to make the movie run for the desired number of minutes. The whole viewing experience was so artificial that I couldn't care less who came out on top."
1785,the-squid-and-the-whale-movie,JohnB.,1," I really like Jeff Daniels and had high hopes for this film-but let's be honest-this thing is a mess from the opening lame tennis scene to the pitifil ending. The actors really sleepwalked thru this-and with good reason. The script is shallow, predictible and worst of all-boring. If you want a good script about marital discord, see The Weatherman. Not perfect, but infinately better in every category than this fiasco."
1786,syriana-movie,HowardF.,10," One of the best movies of the year. While some may complain of no action, the information IS the action and leaves you sitting in your seat stunned. This story of wealth and power is a powerhouse effect. I was prepared to pay attention and think about what was going on and had little trouble keeping it all together. It's not necessary, though, to try and keep track of every detail because the load of information given to you sets the mood and ambiance. But you do have to pay attention. So riveting that the two rows I sat in didn't budge as the credits rolled up."
1787,mechanic-resurrection-movie,Vickimage,3,"I love a good Jason Statham action film but this isn't one of them. Too many of the action scenes are spoilt by obvious green screen backgrounds and digital CGI effects'so it all feels a bit fake . The producers have tried to make this like a James Bond film with locations all over the world so the scenery is great but the story is borderline ludicrous. Jessica Alba's character, especially, makes no sense. Poor Michelle Yeow - so good in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon - is wasted here. Jason is Jason."
1788,rachel-getting-married-movie,JordanL,10," A note to reviewers: They are critics for a reason. And you are not for the same reason. Get an education. Maybe then you could understand that EVERYTHING that a director includes in a film is there for a reason. Don't be so quick to shove everything off. And don't call these people ""yucky"". Some of us have families who have gone through similar things."
1789,the-hunger-games-catching-fire-movie,MagicWanda,10,This is one of those rare times when I have read the book and was pleased with the movie.  The producers/directors did a fine job following the story and the actors did a great job making the characters true to form. Loved this movie!
1790,friends-with-benefits-movie,allmovies,8,"Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) think it's going to be easy to add the simple act of sex to their friendship, despite what Hollywood romantic comedies would have them believe. They soon discover however that getting physical really does always lead to complications."
1791,a-christmas-story-movie,JackE.,10, This movie ia classic such a claasic that the original house was bought and put back in the original setting up to the Foot light. I always injoy it every time I watch it.
1792,the-imitation-game-movie,GreatMartin,9,"“The Imitation Game” is that rarity, an almost perfect film. The technical and scientific aspect will be satisfying to nerds and not so detailed to go over the heads of the rest of the audience. The acting is natural, believable and gets you involved with the lives of all the individual. Though it covers many serious subjects there are quite a few laugh out loud lines and scenes spring from the natural aspects of the characters. For those who never heard of Alan Turing he was an English mathematical genius who broke the German Enigma code and is said to be responsible for WW2 ending 2-4 years earlier than it would have. He also was arrested for being a homosexual in 1951 and was given the choice of prison or chemical castration. He was to eventually commit suicide though his mother contends that it was an accident. Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing shows the man’s brilliance while at the same time shows that he wasn’t comfortable around people and offering all around him humor by his lack of social understanding. Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke the only female member of the group who worked on the Enigma code and accepts Turing proposal of marriage. Each member of the group are comfortable in their roles with Matthew Goode, described as a ‘cad’, a standout. Charles Dance, Mark Strong, Allen Leech, Rory Kinnear, Mattew Beard and Alex Lawther as the young Turing, all add to the strength of the film. The screenplay by Graham Moore is sharp, the direction by Morten Tyldum moves things smoothly along and handles the alternating between the three different time periods without any confusion. Right now Cumberbatch is the front runner for the Best Actor Oscar, deservingly so, and the movie is on many 10 best lists. Though I feel what makes it from being a perfect movie is how he was brought down in his life, his homosexuality, is sort of slighted from how/why he was caught and the society that made it a crime at that time. “The Imitation Game, is a must see movie for anyone who likes an intelligent, emotionally moving finely acted film."
1793,barb-wire-movie,pgmark,1,"Horrible but nice eye candy i guess at the time.  Weak everything and rather funny with Pam Andersen in a ""tough"" acting character - wrong lol! Very forgettable and wish I had that time back to have watched something else."
1794,moana-movie,Jess_Hill,8,"This highly anticipated film is an enjoyable one that is utterly predictable and too long. The visual design is stunning, and there are some brilliant sequences, but the pacing and endless exposition mean that, at around two hours, it's unnecessarily long for the story to be appreciated. Whilst the performances are good, the soundtrack is one which is somewhat bland for a Disney film; catchy tunes, forgettable lyrics. A nice family film overall, but not one of Disney's best. 7.76/10A special mention, however, must go to the brilliant Inner Workings, which is worth the price of admission on its own. Funny and poignant, this is a superb short film delightfully executed. 9.23/10"
1795,cloverfield-movie,Josh,10, FINALLY! A movie is not afraid of taking a chance on putting in little effort on a minimal storyline and a random alien monster beating the hell out of NYC. I loved it. The camera action tied in beautifully to the movie and just heightened the effect the movie was aiming for. Well done J.J.!
1796,shaun-of-the-dead-movie,grandpajoe6191,8,"Other than the ""Simon Pegg+Nick Frost"" performance combo, ""Shaun of the Dead"" throws in humor, a humor that applies to every kind of problems we have; politics, life, love and so on. A zombie movie that is humorously scary to watch."
1797,haywire-movie,nevermindpopfil,8,"The world of espionage has changed, it is now mostly ran by private contracting firms. Firms about liability clauses and the money that comes from ignoring due diligence. Along with that sort of money comes smarmy bosses like Kenneth (a resplendently despicable Ewan McGregor). Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is tired of Kenneth, his lackeys and his poor work ethic. Trust is a valuable commodity in her field and trust, it seems, is in short supply. So she is getting out for good. Or so she thinks.The spy film has worn the tread off its tires and given Steven Soderbergh's propensity for add style and flair to even the stodgiest genre. Telling Mallory's story in separate pieces keeps the audience from anticipating too much of what comes ahead, but we all know this much: hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. And this woman fights; she does it because it is honest. Brutally honest. You can't fake your way through a fight and that is what Mallory has to her advantage: you can't lie or cheat your way to winning.Soderbergh's capturing of fight sequences in Haywire is a sight to be seen. Every punch thrown sends the viewer back into his/her seat. He doesn't cut away from the action and in doing so captures what few action films do: raw intensity. The sound mixing leaves every bone-crunch, connected kick, and broken vase felt. Mallory Kane is the best at what she does and what she does is kick ass.Featuring an Ocean's 11-level assemblage of stars like Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas and Michael Douglas, Haywire's cast fires on all cylinders. Fassbender is fun to watch as alwaysâ"
1798,the-ugly-truth-movie,MaryW,0, If you saw the trailers then you saw the only good parts- the rest was horrible!!
1799,along-came-polly-movie,heyitsmegrif4,1,Without its major silliness it would've had heart and some good performances. But sadly it is too raunchy to be taken seriously at all. I give this movie 16%. Yeah don't see this.
1800,full-metal-jacket-movie,Datmoviemadman,8,"The first half will enhance, with incredible acting from R. Lee Ermey. Only to be very slightly disappointed throughout the second, but all in all the greatest war movie ever made."
1801,twelve-years-a-slave-movie,drlowdon,8,"12 Years a Slave is an adaptation of the 1853 slave narrative memoir Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup, a New York State-born free African-American man who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C., in 1841 and sold into slavery. This really is a powerful movie, one that is made all the more affecting by being a very accurate portrayal of a true story. The cast are excellent and it never shy's away from showing the true horrors of slavery without, without resorting to any cheap shock tactics.A must see movie."
1802,the-others-movie,MaximusP.,8, One of the best films Kidman has done.  Her performance is first rate.  She will do fine without Tom Cruise.
1803,brokeback-mountain-movie,RiverR.,10," This movie has moved into my conciousness and shows no sign of looking for the exit. I'll likely pull it out at times, not unlike Ennis' and Jack's reunions, and put my emotions through their reps again. By the way, someday more people will realize that this isn't a GAY love story....it's a story.....a story with power and sensitivity. Even if you're not presently willing to see this movie, trust me, someday you will watch it, and, whether you admit it or not, it will touch you deeply. This motion picture touched me in so many ways and on so many levels; still, it's done subtly yet powerfully without going for shock value or making a direct statement. The performances by all the cast are sublime and, yes, everything you've heard about Mr Ledger's portrayal is true and I say this without meaning to diminish Mr Gyllanhal's work or that of the other supporting players. Beautifully done! All this is, of course, the very apparent result of Mr Lee's incredibly gifted interpretation of Ms Proulx's short story. What a gift!"
1804,the-conspirator-movie,spadenx,2,"It had it's moments but the movie just failed to capture what should have been an emotional powerhouse. I didnt feel any emotion at all during this film besides the humerous fact that there were some terrible mis-casts for this film. Justin Long (a terrible cast who plays his part poorly), Alexis Bledel (who is as interesting as watching walls), and Evan Rachel Wood (a serious over-acting actress that sucks hard through out). James McAvoy however plays his part perfectly but he alone cant make up for the trash around him. Also lets face it, The film was boring. It was insanely predictable that the woman was gonna be a sacrificial lamb from the begining, It spoiled the journey of getting to that point. I generally like films like this (which is why I rented it) but this is one film that I would suggest avoiding. I did not like it at all."
1805,divergent-movie,GabrielaRodB,8,"I'm giving 8 to the movie because as a person that has read the book I felt that there were some details that shouldn't have been left behind, however Im giving 8 to the movie because even when you didn't read the book you'll understand it without trying too hard and they were kind of true to the book, they weren't mayor changes so yeah, I'm looking forward to Insurgent :)."
1806,la-vie-en-rose-movie,AdaM,10," I highly recommend this movie, but it is long and because the storyline kind of flash forward and backward a bit too much, it can get confusing at times (a lot of the time leaping took place between her late 20s and early 30s, therefore her looks didn't change very much so it gets hard to get the sequence right, the fact that I had to read the caption doesn't help but it's my fault for not understanding French!! Because of the length bring a cushion with you if you can (I was in a cinema with well worn seats that resemble recliners, I had to crane my neck throughout that 140 minutes in order to watch the movie and not the cinema's ceiling). I am going to watch it again this week with a seat at the back (so that it is easier to read the caption while watching the rest of the screen) and a cushion."
1807,avengers-infinity-war-movie,Moviereviewer15,10,"Here are my spoiler-free thoughts of “Avengers: Infinity War”:10 years of buildup has lead to this. Marvel Studios promised a movie worth 10 years of building a cinematic universe. And, worth it, it sure as hell was. This IS Thanos’s movie. There are surprises no one is expecting. There are character interactions that will make people giddy. But, as much as the humor isn’t lost, even though some will want it to be brought down a bit, lucky for them, darkness isn’t abandoned. Because when Thanos shows up, consequences there are. Trust me when I say no one is prepared for what they see. “Avengers: Infinity War” is indeed worth the hype. One of the best Marvel movies ever. And, Thanos is the best Marvel movie villain ever. Josh Brolin NAILED him. And, that’s why this movie succeeded. Well done, Disney, Marvel Studios and Kevin Feige. You did it.I give “Infinity War” a 5-Star rating.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Also, there is one surprise in this movie the anti-Disney trolls failed to spoil. And, that’s why I say to them when they try to spoil the movie: #NotTodayZurg."
1808,star-wars-episode-ii---attack-of-the-clones-movie,YorkMan,1,"Attack of the Clones (AotC) is the absolute nadir of the franchise. Although The Phantom Menace was bad, it was the start of a new trilogy and as such was primarily setting up characters and the universe. OK, it introduced two of the most hated aspects of the franchise (Jar Jar Binks, and the idea of 'Midichlorians'), but there was enough action and some pretty good set pieces. Throw in John Williams best piece of music since Raider of the Lost Ark (Duel of the Fates), and there was a real buzz that the second part of the trilogy could exceed expectations, if.... IF... George Lucas took on board what the viewers liked and (more importantly) disliked about TPM. But, George Lucas didn't do that. Instead he came up with one of the most hated films of all time.Virtually everything about the movie is awful. From the lacklustre, by the numbers, boring direction, to the slow paced, tiresome, almost nonsensical plot. The editing is atrocious, the score is bland, the overuse of CGI/Green screen, the truly inept comedic moments..... And that's not even mentioning the worst part of all.... The casting of Hayden Christensen in the pivotal/vital role of the now teenage Anakin Skywalker. The plot revolves around the fact the Jedi can no longer use the Force to see images of the future. The Dark Side has compromised their abilities, and as such the Jedi are making decisions blindly. As a consequence, despite it making no sense, they charge Anakin with the protection of Senator (formerly Queen) Amidala, and they go for a romantic vacation to Naboo. Meanwhile Obi-Wan is tasked with uncovering a conspiracy surrounding a planet removed from the Jedi archive, due to it being the home of the assassin who is trying to kill the Senator. At the same time the evil Darth Sideous/Chancellor Palpatine is maneouvering the political side of things, stirring up trouble in the senate, whilst promoting the increasingly aggressive acts of violence by a separatist group (under the control of former Jedi Count Dooku, but now Dark Jedi (and Sideous' new apprentice) Darth Tyranus). The three parallel storylines unfold, with Anakin and Padme Amidala falling in love, Obi-Wan discovering a secret clone army, and Count Dooku/Palpatine causing political ructions.The film builds up to a climax on an industrial planet, where all Hell breaks loose and we get the obligatory big fight scenes and subdued ending. When you write down the basic plot synopsis, it doesn't sound so bad. And I suspect, on paper, George Lucas thought so too.But, the actual finished product is simply horrific.As mentioned, the entire plot makes no sense, there are innumerate plotholes, as well as moments where you just say 'well, why didn't he/she/they just do this instead?' as you stare blankly at the screen in disbelief at the stupidity of virtually every character in the film. Anyway, back to Hayden Christensen. He's shown he can act, in other subsequent films. but in AotC he's more wooden than the Black Forest, and appears to have no idea what he's doing.But then again, it doesn't help that he (and everyone else) is working from one of the most terrible scripts ever written. It's almost as if George Lucas was unable (as both director/writer) to imagine his actors expressing emotion through their acting/vocal range/physical expressions etc. So, he instead chose to actually have the characters simply state their emotional point of view. In most cases it's cringeworthy, in some (Hayden Christensen, I'm talking about you!!) it's unintentionally hilarious. I'm being extremely critical, but that's because there are people out there (read some of the other 'reviews') who think that the original Trilogy is some kind of masterwork.... These people need to take a step back and either admit they were wrong, or offer up some real arguments/points about why they would give this movie anything other than a well-deserved low score!! Are there any good points?? Well, there's far less Jar Jar, and Midichlorians (whilst mentioned) are played down immensely. It's also good to see a large group of Jedi in action, at the peak of their powers... Even if they are just waving waving sticks in a choreographed manner in front of a green screen.... It still has some resonance, and is as close as Star Wars ever got to really putting the Jedi (as this mythical group of warriors) on-screen.But apart from those things....It's pretty much the crap-fest I've explained it to be. Ultimately, I suspect people on this site will have seen the movie, and if someone hasn't, they'll more than likely pull up some official review from YouTube, or look up something on Google...So, it's just been about me expressing my opinions, in the hope someone has a look."
1809,the-da-vinci-code-movie,TimG.,2," Contains nearly as many examples of Deus ex Machina as the entire Harry Potter series, some of the most wooden dialouge outside of an Uwe Boll film, and multiple ridiculous ""history lessons"" where characters feel the need take a pit stop while being chased by the police so they can spout off lectures about ancient history. How could millions of readers be so dumb?"
1810,2-fast-2-furious-movie,Leo51,2," Great car chase sequences. That's the one and only factor that prevents this film from being a complete clunker. Bad script, absolutely terrible dialogue and completely unlikeable two dimensional characters. Maybe it's just me but I dont see anything remotely likeable about a pair of guys who break the law by speeding, shooting at police officers and putting innocent bystanders lives at risk by driving at top speeds. And when were not seeing unlikeable characters breaking the law and looking like heroes for it, we are treated to a bunch of teenage hollywood fluff of semi naked girls in bikinis, muscular men with their shirts open all the while listening to the rap filled film score. And if that mindless crap dosent turn anyone with an IQ over 10 off this film then the acting sure will. Paul Walker and Tyrese cant act to save their lives. Their dialogue is comprised of ""yo"", ""cuz"", ""bitch"", ""sup"", and ""let's see what chu got!"". As a side note, I think the costume designer in this film must be no more than 20 years old. Paul Walker's clothing involves brand name street clothes that would only interest a 16 year old. Avoid this movie at all costs."
1811,obsessed-movie,AI88,0,One of the worst movies ever made. I wish I could give this rotten pile of excrement a  negative 1000000000 as a score. This movie is pure filth and the people responsible should be punished.
1812,assault-on-precinct-13-movie,alexh.,3, Painfully childish logic employed in the storyline.
1813,melancholia-movie,MovieMan12,0,You have to be out of your mind for liking this dreadful dense bore. So depressing but for no valid reason. My eyes were hurting just starring at this pile of junk.
1814,a-christmas-carol-movie,CaptainSpaulding,3," Dickens? Disney? Carrey? Seems like a marriage made in Heaven doesn't it? Well...just a little south of there perhaps. This movie was pretty pointless really. Very little story, very little characterizations (perhaps they think we know all that by now). Mainly an excercise in how to make a big screen, big money 3D (which I didn't see it in) movie! It this is what we are dealing with...spare us! Save yourself some aggravation and watch the 1938 version w/Reginald Owen or if you want a musical the fantastic version known as ""Scrooge"" w/Albert Finney ( a brilliant rendition). This one...""Bah Humbug""."
1815,they-came-together-movie,lukechristiansc,8,"If ""disaster movie"" meets  romantic cliche'd parody movie we got ourselves  'They came together' a idiotic parody that makes the Wayans' brothers look smart, but the chemistry between Rudd and Poehler is so funny   and clever also  a dolt film . Director David Wain's script is funny and a little tiresome, but the chemistry between the leads is a droll. Grade A-"
1816,margot-at-the-wedding-movie,Orlando,8," Fearless acting, superbly written and excellent directing in this outstanding film about family interactions, parenting, and the natures of family loving."
1817,the-strangers-movie,RG.,1," There is no need to express it with intelectual words or in a complicated way, feeding society with such horrible sadism is just plain wrong. Also im not sure who is sicker, the killers or the moviemakers that care more abot the money they make than the effect they do with such pointless negativity. Unfortunately I have to say the director really knows how to keep suspense and scare but it wont last long, yolull eventually get bored of repetitive slow attemps of scaring you and eventually youll find stupid how these ""ninjas"" or killers trained by James bond are simply always a step ahead in an unrealistic way."
1818,predator-movie,evokings,9,"This movie is amazing, one of Arnold's best movies, it's a great movie, imagine Rambo vs aliens, and you get the picture of what the movie is like I won't ruin the plot for others but it's a great movie vary well done."
1819,the-incredibles-movie,BradySmith,9,"Perhaps the best animated movie ever made.  It's actually more like an actual superhero movie than something you'd expect to come out of Pixar (not that their other movies are bad.) It's just written in a way that adults can relate to more than little kids can, which is a good thing.  The concept of a retired superhero who's tired of getting old is clever, and the animation itself is also really good.  I'd say it's definitely Pixar's best."
1820,step-brothers-movie,Compi24,7,"Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are enjoyably idiotic in ""Step Brothers,"" Adam McKay's absurdist love letter to the American family dynamic and what it means to be a child."
1821,once-movie,KathyS,9," Low-key, enjoyable, charming. I left the theatre and immediately went in search of the CD. Wound up buying it for less on I-Tunes. A word of caution: After reading all the glowing reviews, don't go in expecting to be blown away as if this were some major blockbuster. It's just a good little movie and well worth your time."
1822,life-of-pi-movie,Dafster,8,"When I saw the trailer for this, the only things that really drew me in were how the Coldplay music and drums were synchronised with the titles and how pretty the water looked under the night sky and sunset. After seeing this, I can say that there is so much more to it that I enjoyed! The first half hour was fairly slow paced as it was all about Pi's back-story. Through this part I was thinking ""Gee, they're taking some time with this, I wonder when it's going to really start, will they even have enough time for the main parts?"" Well after that half hour, it definitely made up for the slow start - it just got better as it went on! When I saw the trailer, I was wondering how they were going to make the majority of the movie on a life boat out at say without getting boring after a while, but it turned out that I enjoyed every second of it! And it somehow gets even better towards the final 45 minutes or so. I highly recommend this - a lot of it can be evoke emotions and is quite deep. When I walked out, I was thinking: ""Wow. That's the best movie I've seen in AGES."" I can easily recommend this, the only thing that's stopping from giving it an 8.5 is that...Metacritic doesn't allow 0.5 after any number. Go see it! It IS incredible!"
1823,dunkirk-movie,Nobilis1984,2,"Can one say me what in him film should be so brilliant? I find him terribly dull. Nolan has delivered here right dung. besides, I have in for Batman: The dark Knight thus famed. Rather looks to you old anti-war films in."
1824,thor-movie,BrahmaBull,7,"Maybe not ""Iron Man"" good, but certainly ""Iron Man 2"" good.  A great rendition of a famous, if not popular, Marvel character.  I can't think of a better Thor than Hemsworth (though young Thor maybe could've been played by that ""Little Hercules"" kid).  I was leery of Portman in a Marvel movie but she did good.  In fact, the entire cast was quite well chosen:  from Odin to Loki to Frigga.  They are missing one very beloved Norse god (can you guess which one?)  But I figure a third Odinson would mess up the plot (don't laugh, there is enough plot to hold it together).  The critics were kind of right about scenes on Earth being more dynamic than the ones in Asgard, but the continuous switching between the two keeps this balanced.  I thought Asgard a little too sterile to be the viking ""heaven"" (I was hoping for some hot valkyries), but their rendition of Bifrost works great.  The mythology is dealt with exactly as I would have:  the Asgardians never refer to themselves as gods.  Though the frost giants were a bit puny to be ""giants"".  Marvel continues the trend of strong female characters (Aunt May, Betsy Ross et al) with Jane Foster.  I dig the hilarious female sidekick Darcy (Kat Dennings).  And Sif (Jaimie Alexander) is a knockout.  The rest of Thor's pals were also faithful to the comic.  And so were the helmet designs.   I miss some of the classic battle cries (For Odin!  For Asgard!) but I suppose those went out along with beardless Thor.  Still, the fanboys should be pleased with references to Donald Blake and the effect of spinning Mjollnir.  Thor could've come off very badly, but it actually ends up standing well on its own.  I'm sure it'll rake in big at the box office this weekend, but Thor isn't one of the characters that is easy to make sequels for.  This will probably be the one and only.  That alone would be a good reason to see it.  On top of that, you know that if you're looking forward to Avengers, you're going to have to see all of these solo outings!"
1825,superman-returns-movie,christianb,2," Worst Superman version ever made in history. Didn't gave it a zero because of Kevin Spacy, but besides his performance, the movie was a disgrace to Hollywood."
1826,the-bully-project-movie,BrianMcCritic,7,An emotional thought provoking movie.  It makes you wonder if you've done enough in your life to make a difference.  It is well put together and makes you think about what can be done to change such bigotry and hate.
1827,the-watch-movie,lmj2k,0,"Detestable, at best.  There is not one character in this movie that has any likability.  The dialogue is painfully unfunny, repetitive, and possesses the subtlety of a frying pan to the face.  I don't necessarily look for high-brow jokes, but there's a difference between making jokes the masses get, and desperate humor that almost begs the audience to like it, pretty please with sugar on top.  Desperation is not appealing in any sense, but especially not in the comedy department.  The plot is beyond ridiculous.  The script should have been burned, the ashes buried, and the earth salted at the burial site so nothing can grow there again.  Who greenlit this?  How can any actors do a serious read on this and not have a piece of their soul die?  There are no redeemable qualities to this movie whatsoever.  Your money would be better spent elsewhere."
1828,shut-in-movie,sjulti,3,"This is a terrible movie, going in you think this is a ghost movie but as it turns out its not that at all, a lot of stuff in this movie is bad the acting the pacing in wich things happen and the twist is so stupid, id save my money if i where you guys"
1829,ginger-rosa-movie,abhi_3245,10,"Romanticizing youth a bit much.Peerless portrayal of adolescent.Enchanting cinematography matched by the most beautiful work by Elle Fanning (Oh!.. I am so a fan) and Alice Englert.and in one word, lets just say it ""beguiling"""
1830,fast-furious-movie,PatE.(aka.Mr.Shammy),7," Sure it isn't the best movie out there, but it does make u appreciate fine automobiles. By the way, you can tell the reviewers who never watched the movie. They were not stealing oil in the Dominican Rebuplic, that setting was in Panama. The setting is Los Angeles, Mexico and Panama. No not all spanish speaking ppl are from Dominican Republic. Anyways, this movie is fun, action packed and sure some of the stunts can't be done without seriously fing up ur car. That is the point, they really don't care about their rides as much as the drive. I gotta say that I expected a lil more driving. But the setting for illegal racing is usually cliche."
1831,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,excelver,1,"I’m writing this because I was wasting time on the internet and ended up seeing some of the initial critics’ glowing reviews of The Last Jedi (It's an 85, ""must see"" here on metacritic). There are always differences of opinion depending on what you want out of a movie, but watching people write about how they convinced themselves this movie succeeded in any way has been outside the normal range. It’s a little bizarre honestly, and fairly excruciating to listen to the phrases being turned to try to explain how this film wasn’t a failure. It wasn’t even impressively bad, it’s just boring and mediocre and uncomfortable. Be honest people, this doesn’t “turn the franchise on its head” or any other stupid euphemism, it’s an insecure and cynical mess that confuses self-ridicule with innovation and tries to be non-formulaic by setting up suggestive premises and then going nowhere with them. It’s like the creators are constantly daring the audience to care about where things are going and seeing how many times they can make you think this movie will eventually go anywhere before you just give up and start zoning out on special FX. Even the parts that deserve some appreciation don’t work well. The sequence on the Las Vegas-style resort world, notwithstanding that it’s completely superfluous to the plot, points out that many people are profiting from the war by selling arms to both sides. I appreciate that the story went out of its way to make that point, but if you are going to use fantasy to provide insight into reality, don’t do it by trying to out-realize reality. If I want to see war profiteering, I’ll just watch the news. This would not have been a hard movie to get right, but instead of the characters evolving naturally they just get repeatedly slammed through these disjointed scenarios ostensibly written to convince you that this isn’t “the same old Star Wars”. I was not a big Force Awakens fan and I don’t want the same old Star Wars, but this movie feels like being in a room full of friends that have lost interest in each other and are killing time by self-consciously making fun of themselves for trying too hard. The prequel trilogy was amateurish, but at least it had a plot and believed in where it was going. This movie might be the biggest flop of the bunch. Hey, sometimes your college try just doesn’t land and you get a real stinker. Life goes on, just stop with this weird insistence that this movie somehow accomplished anything beyond set design."
1832,sucker-punch-movie,BORF,0,"This movie was just awful.  I went to it on opening night with no expectations at all and was still disseminated.  This movie was a plotless, actorless excuse to show girls' naughty parts on a big screen.  I've never been so bored while watching a movie, I kept looking at my watch to see when this terrible movie would be over."
1833,the-dark-knight-rises-movie,Daime_Mizuchita,0,"""The Dark Knight Rises"" is another proff, that Nolan brothers are untalented, like Christian Bale as Batman. Horrible idea making Bane main genius enemy. So boring and so awful action. So stupidly written plot. This thing need to be at the deep of rating, but stupid fans forced this film."
1834,michael-clayton-movie,PeterK.,9," Slow paced at first but an old-school legal thriller that unfolds well through the fine script and brilliant acting of George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, Sydney Pollack and especially Tom Wilkinson. Though there is no true Hitchcock surprise ending, it belongs to his era of film-making. A great film with lots of intelligent dialogue - probably why it is not doing as well as other teenage gore films."
1835,gravity-movie,pannkakaa,7,"How can people that live as movie critics give average 96 ?Its a good movie and the meaning of it is really nice.But its not that good at all, i don't see anything worthy a 96 score in this movie, nothing.Its a really nice story about her daughter and that but i mean, a masterpiece 96 score? No."
1836,the-wrestler-movie,StaticSpine,8,"Aronofsky-style movie about loneliness, despair, regrets and it is great, it's not that pressing as Requiem For A Dream but still it's pretty depressive as all other Aronofsky movies. It leaves you heavy hearted. Mickey Rourke made an outstanding performance."
1837,batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-movie,teg,3,"Sadly, i have to say this movie did not live up to expectations. Pros - ehh batman and superman are in it? cons - TERRIBLE dialogue, plot holes everywhere, not enough action, and lex luthor was ridiculously awful (it's like the actor tried being heath ledger's joker half the time, and a genius the other half). Zack Snyder - you have said time and time again you didn't make this movie for critics, but for fans. Well, I'm a fan of Batman Vs. Superman, and I have to say, you did a pretty garbage job."

1839,tristram-shandy-a-cock-and-bull-story-movie,ClayF.,9, The person who says it fails as a mockumentary is incorrect in assuming that that's what its trying to be: would a mockumentary includea dream sequence? It is a dry comedy and character deconstruction in the style of The Office. It is not the jokes which are the source of the delight: its the unnerving courage of the filmmakers to plunge into their own dark psyches to analyse and celebrate the weaknesses and frailties in us all.
1840,47-ronin-movie,StriderKiwi,1,"Bad action scenes that come and go way too fast. Bad writing and dialgoue. A dull narrative and uninspired acting all around, and some great cg for a not so great everything else.

1842,skyfall-movie,DisasterpieceMK,7,"I enjoyed the experience but cannot help but feel that it was over-hyped. I expected something at least on level with Casino Royale, if not better from the way the critics were gushing over this thing. I will say that I enjoyed it more so than Quantum but it just did not pull me in like I thought it would. The scenes were fun in a lot of ways, but they felt disconnected, or quickly stitched together to form a plot. I enjoy Craig as Bond, and the addition of Q was good but could have been better. Javier Bardem was a great Bond villain that had potential to be excellent if not for the predictable ending."
1843,religulous-movie,MondayQB,1,"Maher is witty and calls out some some ""taken to the extreme"" points, but he fails to use rigorous logic to make his case. Not worth the time to watch. Opinions are fine if supoorted by facts and logic. Maher fails on both counts."
1844,how-to-train-your-dragon-2-movie,Tokyochuchu,7,How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a great sequel to the sublime original. It nails most aspects and easily displays whey the Dragon series is probably the best animated franchise out there. Roll on number 3!
1845,robocop-2013-movie,Movi3R3vi3wer,3,"I didn't expect much from Robocop, I loved the original. It was stupid and over the top but also entertaining as hell and ended up being one of the best action movies of the 80s. The remake, I HATED Robocop. Absolutely nothing good from this unnecessary reboot. I'll say it again, HATED Robocop."
1846,world-trade-center-movie,MannyF.,10,"Drew... you're an idiot. if this movie was indeed a satire while being based on one of the most tragic events in U.S. history, anyone in their right mind would be disguisted. you, however, say that it would make your top ten list.... what a moron. sometimes, it's ok to get something positive and uplifting out of something so horrible. that's how we as normal human beings deal with tragedy from time to time. duh."
1847,predator-movie,MatchesPev,10,"Honestly. You want a film. You get a  film. This is a brilliant, fast paced, action packed movie, full of twists, surprises, and as you'd expect from an Arnie film: a  load of violence. Fantastic movie. You want to watch a movie, the critics are ed up in the head. I mean, Rambo First Blood got a  62% METASCORE!  the critics. Watch this film."
1848,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,billsnuth,2,"This was not a star wars movie.It was a Disney moneygrab. More cute animal merchandise, more pretty visual effects...The plot however, was ridiculous. They cut up Empire Strikes Back and glued it back together, butchering it into a confusing, twisting mess that has more holes than actual substance.The Lucas magic is gone. TFA was good, it made sense and worked well as a movie. A Star Wars Movie. This would be a 5/10 for an original franchise but a 2/10 as a star wars movie."
1849,lost-souls-movie,ADozenEggs,2,"This movie is awful.  And the reviewer who mentions narcissistic pd.  What does any of that have to do with how bad this film was? Predictable, trite, inane.  The list goes on and on.  Cliche after cliche."

1851,the-amazing-spider-man-2-movie,gasolene,0,This movie sucked. I actually laughed at the idiocy of most of it and fast forwarded the other bits. Tragic is an understatement. Did 17 year olds write the script? Please say yes.

1854,iron-man-2-movie,spadenx,8,The biggest flaw of the film is how they pause the action just to show you upgrades to the suit. It was interesting to see what was so different about each suit but to do it right in the middle of a fight takes away all the excitement of the fight that is happening. I didnt mind the plot either but it could have been a lot more interesting and it could have taken a lot less time to explain. I did like how it featured a lot of interesting action through out. I liked the addition of Don Cheadle (as Terrance Howard's replacement) and Robert Downey Jr gave a great performance as well. I suprisingly liked it a lot more then the first film.
1855,earth-to-echo-movie,Spider-Parker,3,"Pretty much.Take out everything that made from , super 8 . The Goonies .E.T.  The Monster Squad. Stand by Me . Chronicle . in my opinion  Earth to Echo is the big remake movie  that Hollywood done"

1857,the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-movie,luke100,7,"I'm really torn on whether this movie is a 7 or an 8. Consistently intriguing and funny, it's also incredibly bizarre and disturbing. Unlike ""Lobster"", which gave you a clear idea of what it's about and then developed that idea in some interesting and surprising way, ""Sacred Deer"" takes a weird plot twist in the middle, leaving you confused in terms of what the hell was this movie actually about. After thinking about it for a longer time, I think it was pretty good, just a bit too bizarre."
1858,prometheus-movie,JYT,8,"Ridley Scott tried to push the limits from previous Sci-Fi/Horror done before and in all directions at the same time: more picturesques, going further with the creation of manking, the horror of the self-surgery, smotther special effects, etc... Charlize Theron plays very well also. Good to watch."
1859,man-of-steel-movie,Voice0fReason,7,"This movie was quite enjoyable. I think that indeed it was the best superman movie to be created and didn't have very many plot holes in it as some previous superman movies had. It was very different from the same old telling of superman: Start with him being shot off of Krypton, have him grow up, learning his abilities one by one, then killing Lex Luther in the end. No, it was very different from that (not going to spoil). I enjoy at the beginning how Krypton was a war torn world instead of a heaven like planet. I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning and the end of the movie. The middle was alright so that is why I give this movie a 7/10,"
1860,zodiac-movie,MattBrady99,9,"“THIS IS THE ZODIAC SPEAKING”.David Fincher's masterpiece ""Zodiac"" turns 11 years old today and it still scares me. In my opinion, it's my favorite David Fincher film. Just the little details that went into re-creating the crime scenes and the overall feel of it. I was surprised to find out how much CGI was in the movie, as it blended so well with the environment it was set in.There are so many great scenes in this movie that I can't name it all. But that basement scene was just nightmare fuel. It scares me more than any horror movie and it's not even a horror film. The cinematography, the sound, the directing, and Gyllenhaal performance was so excellent. The same goes for the rest of the movie."
1861,oblivion-movie,theahsanhaseeb,7,"Oblivion is not one of the worst films of the year but it's not great either. The key thing about it is that it doesn't offer anything new as the director Joseph Kosinski said it pays homage to science-fiction films of 1970s. You will say, ""Oh, I've seen it before!"" a lot while watching it. Another problem is the pace of the film, which is extremely slow at the beginning. The plot takes a lot of time to take-off and that's how I found it boring but I forgot it eventually because the final 30-45 minutes of film are good. What's different about it is that it still manages to entertain you a little because it may not be original but the visual experience it gives you is astonishing, especially with Kosinski's vision and the better production value, it feels like the remixed version of all the sci-fi films released in the past. The best things about this film are its landscapes, the brilliant cinematography by none other than Claudio Miranda and the background score by M83 which is extremely wonderful. I am only disappointed because the main theme could've made it much better and a bigger film but that didn't happen. Acting wise, it's alright. Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman (I wanted to see more of him), Andrea Riseborough, Olga Kurylenko, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Melissa Leo, all of them are good at their roles. In short, the movie didn't waste my time but I can't rate it better than this because Kosinski didn't do justice to it."
1862,fantastic-mr-fox-movie,DFiddy,10," Superb! Wes' world ported over to animation very well. I had the biggest grin on my face throughout the entire movie. Extremely well done production, voice acting, script...come to think of it, I enjoyed every little detail of it."

1864,alpha-movie,Twopir,2,"Not a good film.  So many things are jarringly inaccurate that I simply couldn’t finish the film.  From the clothes to the decisions that are made by the protagonist.  To put it simply, he would have eaten the wolf, not made it a pet."
1865,moonlight-2016-movie,ourtimehascome,3,"Moonlight may think it's unique, but in fact it is incredibly trite. The entire plot is simply about how the main character deals with being a homosexual. There is no plot. It is a two and a half hour film about a boy discovering his sexual identity. His drug dealing patriarchal mentor, drug addicted mother, and childhood bullying are all elements which have been done a million times before. There was so little payoff in a lackluster ending. The camerawork is all over the place, like it was directed by two different people. The only thing I liked about the film was its attention to realism such as the relationships between students."
1866,slender-man-movie,RyanAustin74,1,"What the f is this trash?, It's not even scary to begin withEXTRA: This pile of elephant sht should be better off if Sony and Screen Gems dragged Sony Pictures Animation and pasted their logo in the very beginning.

1867,a-most-wanted-man-movie,amheretojudge,7,"inexpressibly refreshing to encounter a chess game..A Most Wanted Man3 And A Half Out Of 5A Most Wanted Man is a character driven political thriller about a few good-hearted infiltrators whose attempt to pull of an impossible yet utterly glorious task ends up with dilemmas on each step. The stakes aren't higher as one usually gets in such tales, but the inner politics is so well constructed that you cannot not communicate with its designing. The screenplay is so tight and written like a poetry on the sense that it enfolds each time a different perspective, angle, character and a piece of information that somehow sets the clock at zero. And since the feature is build upon the race against time factor, the sense of urgency never fades away even though it ticks for an entire two hours. Corbign's world is busy in all its act (even in its first act, it doesn't spend its time on laying out the plot for the audience) where the viewers has to work hard to catch up with it. It is rich on technical aspects like using its props, amazing camera work, fine editing and sharp sound effects although fails on pitching a palpable background score. Goose fleshing revelations, tricky and convoluted plot and eye-popping cinematography are the high points of the feature that keeps the audience tangled in its world. Bovell's adaptation might be gripping and layered but Corbign's execution surpasses the script and sensibly respects each frame projected on the screen. Hoffman oozes power, vulnerability and emotional aspects of his character unflinchingly with an amazing supporting cast like McAdams, Dafoe Wright, Bruhl and Krieps. A Most Wanted Man is not what we wanted but needed, in an industry where most of the mission were taken over by action and chase scenes, it is inexpressibly refreshing to encounter a chess game."
1868,defiance-movie,asylumspadez,3,Far too long and would have been a bit better if it wasnt. Solid acting by the main cast as well. The film overall though wasnt that interesting and often was rather dull through most parts of the film.

1872,i-robot-movie,Rox22,8,"A decent enough movie. Will Smith stuck in yet another Sci-Fi role. Visuals are good, story is predictable but entertaining none the less. Overall: This is a movie design for one purpose. To be fun and enjoyable, and that it is. It isn't deep, it isn't original and it definitely doesn't have any memorable performances (aside from Sonny, who is perhaps the only character with some depth.) But again flaws aside (brain at the door) it is allot of fun."
1873,the-accountant-movie,Razv,9,Great movie with beautifully written characters and a great plot to back everything up. The actors do a great job and the directing is top notch as well. I couldn't recommend it more if you're craving for an intense yet meaningful action drama.

1875,suicide-squad-movie,whatdafrak,2,"The first half felt more like a giant trailer / compilation for other films that we're not actually watching. Very bizarre. The second half was confusing as to what the villains plan was. Maybe there's a good movie in there somewhere, but this isn't that version. Plus, the Joker was both underused and also a horrible performance, which may have prompted it being mostly cut out."
1876,sing-movie,BeanmanJames,2,Pretty bad. I accidentally watched this movie three times. Don't make the same mistake.
1877,friends-with-money-movie,RoyS.,3, A boring waste of actors' talent and viewers' time. The film is dismal and incoherent.
1878,only-god-forgives-movie,cleosdad,1,"I wanted to give this movie a zero, but couldn't bring myself to give that score.  Kristen Scott Thomas represents the only redeeming aspect of this film.  It had no flow or real sense of narrative.  Between the acts of ultra violence and sexual innuendo, the movie carried by lots of standing around and Ryan Gosling wearing the same stupid look.  Totally disappointed."
1879,russian-ark-movie,smartmart,10,"A beautiful feat that has become on of the most acclaimed experimental films of all time. The film takes the viewer on a tour of Russian history through the eyes of a ghostly figure. The entire film was shot in one, long continuous take, so you should probably give the filmmakers some credit, even if you don't personally like the film."
1880,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Fingolfin0000,0,"This is by far the worst Star Wars film that has ever been made. Bad acting, poor sub plot. The jokes were forced, overused, and shouldnt have been in the serious parts of the movie. The only reason the Porgs were in the movie was for quick marketing money grab.The only good actors in the movie fell flat, and the only good characters that were in the movie were wasted completely. This film was a travesty. Rian Johnson should be ashamed of what he single-handedly did to ruin this franchise. If this is any indication of where this Star Wars franchise is heading, I for one will never watch another, and I have been a life long fan. Boo, Disney, boo."
1881,insidious-chapter-3-movie,BrianMcCritic,7,Like the other two Insidious films this film has its moments where you need to turn on the lights.  For the most part prequels don't work in the case of this film I was pleasantly surprised.  B+
1882,sucker-punch-movie,EpicLadySponge,2,"Sucker Punch decides to miss the punch and Zack Snyder is the reason why the user score is at a positive standing. Please don't listen to those people, they love to defend every Zack Snyder film."
1883,aliens-movie,TrilobiteG,8,"Although the second act is slightly slow, Aliens is a fantastic sequel to the original film and is packed full of action, female empowerment and detailed monsters that have a realistic presence. I especially like how although the second act is slow, you can still tell that the xenomorphs are on their way, and they aint happy."
1884,skyfall-movie,Knowingspy,7,"After just returning from watching the new James Bond Film, Skyfall, there are a few words that I would use to describe this film- great but not amazing. Ashamedly I have only seen one film before hand of the 23 films- Casino Royale- but I would say that this film is the anti-climax to what was an exciting array of movies this year and in the 50 years Bond has been on screen. Initially I enjoyed the idea of the film, Bond gets shot, Bond comes back to fight a former agent but there are some plot holes throughout the movie that seem glossed over merely for continuity and some forgettable acting that spoils the movie slightly. There were publicised rumours that Pinewood Studios were cash-strapped and had to rely on heavy product placement to help pay for the movie, but you would never had known at times. This film is a visual delight! From the frantic chases through Turkish Bazaars (via CGI) to the neon lights of Shanghai and the mossy hills in the Highlands, this film really is eye candy. The plot revolves around the attempted recovery of stolen records, of which will endanger undercover NATO agents all over the world. James Bond is no longer the spy he used to be, espionage has aged his hair and his shooting isn't as good as it used to be (for some reason) but he will need all of his dull wit and courage to overcome what lies ahead in this movie. Daniel Craig and Dame Judy Dench both reprise their roles as James Bond and M respectively, with the welcomed inclusion of new characters such as Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) and the cyber terrorist Bond bad guy Raoul Silva (played by a bleached-blonde Javier Bardem). Albert Finney makes a late appearance at the end of the film as Bond's ex-groundkeeper and he almost steals the show with his welcomed humour. His role was rumoured to be originally offered to Sean Connery as the ultimate nod to Bond's 50th anniversary but he manages to justify why they casted him instead.... sort of. The inevitable Bond girls as a whole were mostly forgettable and I didn't really care for them if they were under threat  or killed (Sevarine you know who you are). Sometimes the plot just baffled me, why the hell do you have the locations of hundreds of secret NATO agents being carried by an agent? Why can't you just store it in MI6? Are Bond"

1888,the-darkest-minds-movie,thedaywalker,2,"Darkest Minds begins hitting heavy, but unfortunately fails to continue that way. What really seems to me like a remix of the movie ""Divergent"" (which isn't a good thing), The Darkest Minds, focuses on a very forced love story, forcing even more a triangle than actually focusing on children dying over something that gives the survivors powers.Instead it turns into a generic, boring and heavily cliched movie, with corny dialogue that will make you roll your eyes until you have a migraine.There is absolutely NO RESOLUTION to any plot lines, making this feel like a 104 minute long introduction to a sequel. But let's be honest here, will a sequel really happen?"
1889,son-of-the-mask-movie,LoganH,0," I watched this movie hoping that there would be some sign of JIm Carry, but sadly no.The special effects sucked, and what was up with Jamie Kennedy's face when he put it on. Worst movie I have ever seen"
1890,death-wish-movie,seanr06,10,"This movie delivers what is promised, nothing more, nothing less. A great return for the revenge genre. Bad reviews are due to the crybabies that inhabit the larger media space. Who would have guessed that in 2018 a man with a solid traditional family unit meting out justice would be so offensive"
1891,godzilla-2014-movie,YellowKirby,1,"I went into this movie expecting the king of the monsters smashing down buildings, and boy was I disappointed. There's very little Brian Cranston (the only good actor in the movie), and even less of Godzilla. Seriously, he's only in the movie for like, 11 minutes!"
1892,pocahontas-movie,MovieGuys,7,"A very inspiring and dramatic movie, Pocahontas is great dark entertainment. The film is prolific in family friendly storytelling, yet manages to be mature at the same time."
1893,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,FarhanFiroz,10,"The Last Jedi is considered to be the most divisive star wars movie of all time and I totally understand why the Older Fan base hates it but that doesn't mean the movie is complete garbage. Honestly for me Its definitely one of the greatest star wars movie ever made. This isn't your typical star wars movie its more than that. The movie well structured story with excellent performances and stunning visuals which will prolly go down in the books as the greatest.This movie takes risks like no other big franchises do , The bold choices and different direction the future movies go through is something very unique and innovative . The light saber duals look gorgeous with wide angle shots and the only issue I had is the story arc of Finn and Rose which ruins the pacing of the movie, Apart from that this movie is perfect ."
1894,black-panther-movie,JakeG,0,I went to see this last night. Boring predictable storytelling. And it's filled with terrible CGI. There are some amazing actors in this film and they are all wasted. I wish I could have those hours of my life back. It amazes me how reviews like mine are being blocked in favor of reviews from people who say in their reviews that they haven't actually watched the movie. At least metacritic allows honest reviews even if other sites don't.
1895,ohorten-movie,Cat,3," Are these reviewers high? This movie was like watching ice melt. It tried to be quirky and offbeat and only succeeded in putting us to sleep. Every frame was dark, it was perpetual night even when it was day, (welcome to Norway) and the story never got underway. What were they piping into the screening the reviewers saw? Either they were stoned, part of a mass delusion, or money has changed hands."

1897,indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull-movie,LouF.,2, This was a terrible and disappointing movie. The plot was non-existant. It was just a stream of cgi and unbelievable special effects. George Lucas tarnishes yet another classic trilogy. Thanks George!
1898,the-a-team-movie,MartyJ,8,"Now I can remember as a child sitting with my dad and watching the A-Team and loving it and then watching it again in my late teens on bravo and still enjoying it but realising an action series where only 2 people die in the whole thing is not really that hardcore. This being said this remake had the worrying start of a franchise where every episode they blow up cars but everyone gets out ok and making a flame-thrower out of a butane bottle and a cigar. Now this film is no where near this and is only the A-Team in spirit and this is no bad thing. Take this for what it is a re-branding of the A-Team to modern standards and if you watch it in this frame of mind then it becomes a good, witty action film, there are some one liners in the film which are pure laugh out loud class. There are all the subtle nuances which are from the original series and all the jokes between the characters are still there, but this is by no means and important part so if you've not seen the series it won't hurt you. There are some issues with it if you really want to be critical the portrayal of BA my second favourite character to Dwight Schultz Murdock is a little light, he's great in the action but the philosophy bit gets in the way, in one scene he is quoting Ghandi and then in the next beating down on one of the bad guys. Casting on the whole is very good Liam Neeson is good as usual and seems to be in everything at the moment.So all in all a very enjoyable film worth watching for anyone. Action From Start to Finish and it doesn't let up much apart from where it needs to. 8/10"
1899,tyler-perrys-shes-living-my-life-movie,WhateverHowever,2,"I do not like any of Terry Perry's movies. Only reason why I watched this movie last night, is because my mother wanted to go because of all black cast and Tyler Perry. Only 6 people in the movie screening room. I knew I wouldn't like it. Wish I could slip into another movie screening room to watch ""A Quiet Place"". The only person I feel sorry for was the Black man(lead actor). I forgot his name. I don't like any of the characters. This is the movie where it won't sit in Netflix for long. Because nobody will rent it over and over again. Spike Lee and Tyler Perry are so lucky,  sad that they make dreadful movies. Maybe in Netflix's African American category... with all the other stupid movies. Black Panther is one of the best movies with the all-black cast. Color Purple too...  but were produced, written and directed by White people. Oh well."
1900,need-for-speed-movie,Izitmee,3,"The car scenes are nicely shot, paying a great deal of homage to the videogames. If only the screenplay hadn't been written by 4 years old douchebags and the acting wasn't only divided between ""staring at a blank mirror"" and ""I can't relieve myself since a week but I'm gonna try right now"" it might have not bored me to death."
1901,the-x-files-i-want-to-believe-movie,Mark,8," Good movie. Not great, but good and definitely worth watching. I am a long time X-files watcher and I watched it with my girlfriend who has never watched X-files. My girlfriend even liked it. Probably because there were no aliens in it :). You will feel left with some unanswered questions and a not fully explained plot, but a sense that you know where Scully and Mulder are these days and an entertaining murder-mystery."

1903,the-curious-case-of-benjamin-button-movie,Spangle,8,"Probably one of the more unique films I have ever seen, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a moving film about life and truly wraps you up into its world and never lets you go, ultimately leaving you deeply affected and moved by the film. The direction by David Fincher is fantastic as usual. The cinematography is also gorgeous and perfect for a film of this type. The costume and production design are also pitch perfect, as is the stunning makeup. The makeup is some of the best I have ever seen in a film, honestly. The acting from Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, and Taraji P. Henson, is also very powerful and very good. The unique story of a man born old and who gets younger as time goes on, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a touching, brilliantly made film that is a tad long, but never feels as long as it is, especially since you wish there was more to see once the credits start rolling. While the romance elements have been done before, the unique twist thrown in here adds a certain freshness to it that elevates it above your usual romantic film. This is a film you need to see."
1904,a-beautiful-mind-movie,Spangle,8,"As a whole, A Beautiful Mind is a good film that is overshadowed by the performance of its lead actor. Yes, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, and Paul Bettany, are all great here and in general, but holy cow does Russell Crowe stand tall. Truly a masterful performance from Crowe, his performance makes the film, though the film  itself is certainly interesting. Ron Howard's direction is typically strong here and he does a good job telling the story of famed mathematician John Nash. However, where this film is most strong in terms of story is in its telling of Nash's struggle with schizophrenia. In a way, it really opens your eyes as to how it is to live with schizophrenia and suffering through the delusions associated with it. In a sense, this is one of the better films on mental disease ever made as it paints a very real, distressing, and disturbing portrait, all of which make you appreciate the genius of Nash all the more."

1907,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,goatula,3,"Once upon a time JJ Abrams wrote down his favorite original trilogy scenes on separate note cards. He spread the cards before him. Wow, he thought, these scenes are cool. Since I'm doing the first movie of the trilogy, I'll keep most of the notecards from A New Hope and discard the rest. However, I'll keep the Vader/Luke catwalk scene as people tend cite that as their favorite. I'll keep the ROTJ cards too, actually. Ok, there's still a lot of scenes here. I'll keep the ones that I've seen referenced in popular culture the most, and discard the rest...no, wait, let's keep it all- I'll alter them just enough so as not to violate that contract we signed with George. Hmm, the original cast is older now. 30 years have passed. Let's write out the ramifications of the original trilogy such that Han is still a smuggler, Leia is leading a resistance and Luke, well, he told me he can't jump anymore so we'll stash him on an island somewhere. The opening crawl will make the movie about him, though, because, you know, Luke. Luke has disappear, Leia Luke! Crawl complete. Ok, I have unlimited freedom and creativity in this universe. I need a climactic space battle scene. What's something that's never been done before in this universe? Death Star! But mine, mine will be bigger. Planet-sized. That's big, and the original Death Star worked because it was big, right? Wait, if it's a planet, there won't be any space battles in the movie- good trade off though because big. Since the Vader/Luke catwalk scener- er I mean Han/Ren scene needs to happen, and we need force awakening, let's do a mashup ROTJ style as main character arcs are so 1970s. Ray will learn about the force by showing her concentrating and/or flashing back. They'll explain it in the next episode of Lost. I guess I'm old school- I like character growth, originality, pacing and WONDER. These are created dynamically and with intent and priority, and won't emerge passively from a cut n paste hackjob. I can go on for days about this farce, but I've seen others doing a good job. Glad I'm not alone. 3 stars, because some of the acting was nice. I'd rank it 5th in the series, above TPM and AOTC."

1909,slither-movie,MarcD.,9, Easily one of the funniest movies I've seen in the last couple of years. Great cast. Solid gore. Interesting premise - or good enough to sustain the story. I recommend it.
1910,the-help-movie,CitizenCharlie,8,"The Help is at once a joy to watch for its absorbing yet haunting story and for the superior acting by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer.  On the other hand, it is nauseating at times to suffer through the scenes of outright cruelty perpetrated by the white women of the south in the early 1960s.  It is one thing to read about Jim Crow in a book or listen to an old person nowadays discussing what it was like, but to see reenactments of just how dehumanizing and vindictive the times were is just unsettling.  This is an important story, fictional yes, but representative of a time and a place which reminds the audience just how ashamed we should be at aspects of our past. A few decades ago in the south, it was commonplace for a white family to employ a black maid.  Maid is an all encompassing term for house cleaner, cook, nanny, grocery shopper, butler, and every other menial task you could think of.  They potty trained the toddlers, read them stories, and pretty much raised the children instead of their mothers who were enjoying that afternoonâ"

Visually impressive, with some strong emotional moments (and a handful that try, but end up sounding silly), the plot is far less confusing to the uninitiated than its immediate predecessor. Still, a lot was cut from the books, which is sure to dissapoint the die-hard readers. Regardless, a very strong movie."
1915,spider-man-3-movie,KyleW.,2,"Not nearly enough action, dragged on too long with scenes full of dull sappy scenes. and the whole movie was ruined with the stupid display of peter parker trying to act cool and ""badass""."

1918,under-the-skin-movie,inaneswine,7,"Under The Skin, as an oft-proclaimed ""art film"", is far less focussed on script and character than it is on pushing the boundaries of cinematography and intriguing editing to create truly one of the most beautiful-looking films of recent times, its striking imagery and atonal soundtrack harking back to some of Kubrick's best work. Even if it is far too weird for some, and far too dull for others."
1919,hairspray-movie,JimY.,1," This movie will not appeal to any man who does not have a strong desire to live in San Francisco. or key west. It is about the most mind numbing thing I have watched this side of rush Limbaugh. There will always be people who like any crap served to them because they think they are sophisticated. but this move it not. I think Travolta days are better spent flying instead of acting if this is the best he can do. I strongly sug. you do not spend your money on this film, I down loaded it from the net and even though I did not pay for it, I felt cheated out of my time and want it back."

1921,the-beguiled-movie,shpostal,2,"Given good reviews ahead of time, I was expecting a movie that used both atmosphere and the tensions of war to create maybe a suspenseful borderline psychotic thriller and the trailer seemed to indicate that these little private girl's school deep in the Spanish moss covered Virginia backwoods during the Civil War, 1964 to be exact, was a sinister place with hints of madness blossoming into a real fruit cake of a movie.    I was wrong.    For a movie called ""The Beguiled"", there is nothing particularly beguiling about it.    Colin Farrell plays a wounded Union soldier taken in by the home to heal from his wounds, and the movie drags along to the half way point with no real action, suspense, and very little moving plot.    Only after that point does it begin to show promise, and despite some great possibilities for a truly frightening movie, it falls flat.    We never get past the prissy performance by Nicole Kidman, who shows about as much depth as a kiddie pool.    What is supposed to pass for real sexual frustration and tension barely scratches the surface, and even when Farrell starts getting ""creepy"", unconvincingly at that, the movie just doesn't connect.    We get a lot of praise for Sofia Coppola, but I don't see the greatness that she supposedly possesses.    This is a movie long on expectation, boring in its delivery, and left my wife and I wondering just what the fuss was all about.    It's a dud and that's too bad because in the right director's hands, it could have been special.    Instead it's just another remake of a movie that didn't need remaking in the first place."

1923,harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-movie,JenK.,1, It want that good and was as close to the book and the graphics stunk. It was more drama and not enough info that should've been on there. They took half the book out and added what they wanted. The best movie to me was the third. Keep them coming but try not to make them so corny. Stick to the book some more. I mean the maze was poor and it would've been cool if they kept some parts in it. Although movies cost money the book I would rate like a 9. Oh well.
1924,the-hangover-part-ii-movie,Khunter4382,8,"So what if it follows the same formula as the first? So what if the humor is super crude? What did you honestly expect? Once again, this wonderful cast comes together for another crazy night out, and the result is another film that made me laugh, and made me laugh hard. While it just isn't as quite as good as the first, I still thoroughly enjoyed this film, with ""Alan"" stealing the show again with his every line."
1925,the-martian-movie,TheShrike222,7,"Beautiful visuals and lots of interesting problem-solving. I liked that they saved fully articulating Matt Damon's philosophy of how to survive until the end. Damon did a good job with the material he had. However. The story is Robinson Crusoe with  MacGyver thrown in. I didn't like Crusoe when I read it years ago and every move treatment I've seen hasn't changed my mind. I watched the whole movie, but came away with that Robinson Crusoe feeling. I could have watched the first half hour, skipped to the end and missed nothing. This is not a criticism of of the actors, directors or crew. They made a beautiful movie. I just wish people would stop using this particular plot. It was old in 1719 when Daniel Defoe wrote it."

1931,frozen-2013-movie,MrMovieBuff,10,"'Frozen' is the 53rd feature from Walt Disney Animation Studios and the 7th Disney movie executive produced by John Lasseter (director of 'Toy Story' (1995) ). The people at Disney went all out with this movie, offering beautiful animation, spectacular songs, a well-written story and more colorful characters for kids to love. 'Frozen' is a loose adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen"" in which it follows the story of a Queen named Elsa (voiced by former Broadway star Idina Menzel) who was born with the ability to freeze things and make snow appear. She has a young sister named Anna (Kristen Bell) who she accidentally zapped in the head during childhood and had to have her memory erased of her sister every having powers. In order to protect Anna, Elsa locks herself in her bedroom and avoids any kind of contact from Anna. Anna feels like that she has done something to Elsa to cause this divide, but Elsa's anxiety and depression causes her ice powers to overwhelm her. It's clever how the people at Disney changed the Snow Queen from making everybody the victim of her powers to becoming somebody who is the victim of her own powers. During the coronation, the gates to the castle finally open after years of being locked, Elsa is crowned the Queen of her kingdom since their parents died (typical Disney). Also, Anna meets a handsome man named Prince Hans of the Southern Isles (Santino Fontana), they plan to get married and ask for Elsa's blessing, but Elsa doesn't want anybody to live in the castle, not when she has these powers that she needs to hide, and doesn't think that Anna should marry some man she just met. Elsa accidentally exposes her powers in front of the guests at the ceremony and they all believe that she is some sorcery villain that performs witchcraft. Kind of like the Snow Queen in the original fairy tale. Elsa runs away in exile and it's up to Anna to bring her back and make things right. Obviously, the movie is famous for that ""Let it Go"" sequence, while the song is great and Idina Menzel showcases her best singing talent, the animation behind it all is stunning. This is some of the best animation I've seen since 'Beauty and the Beast' (1991) and 'Finding Nemo' (2003), we get a lot of tracking shots, establishing shots and high-angle shots as Elsa builds her ice castle. The color palette is mostly limited to blue and white...it's ice and snow, there's not many colors to use. On the way, Anna meets an ice salesman named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) who agrees to help Anna find her sister and they bump into a small, talking snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad) who offers plenty of laughs thanks to his perfect timing and whispering instead of shouting his jokes. If there's one thing that this movie does, and a lot of good animated movies do this well, is making the characters believable and make you forget that you're watching an animated movie. You forget that you're watching a bunch of drawings that have celebrity voices, these characters are arguably more real than the live-action characters from the ""Transformers"" sequels and the ""Twilight"" franchise, those characters are archetypes and are one-dimensional...but not these ones. Walt Disney's 'Frozen' is a handsome and absorbing movie that whisks you away into its magical world, the music is great, the animation is great and the characters are great. I did not know what to expect in Disney's 53rd feature, but not an experience this magical."
1932,no-reservations-movie,JACKU.,2," If I hadn't been with a friend, I would have walked out. Cliched script. No energy to the movie except making people move fast (and even when they did, you could practically hear the director saying ""pick up the pace, people"". All of the acting seemed mechanical. Absolutely NO chemistry between Eckhart and Zeta-Jones. This was a waste of my time and money! And my date concurred."
1933,wonderstruck-movie,TVJerry,7,"Two children living in eras 50 years apart set out to New York City on separate quests. Their parallel journeys lead them on an intriguing and sometimes spellbinding trip. Since both of the protagonists have lost their hearing, much of the film takes place with only music and sometimes rather creative imagery. Some of the sequences require patience to endure the imaginative approach, but the payoff is worth it.The performances are compelling and director Todd Haynes has gone all out…or all art!"
1934,star-wars-the-clone-wars-movie,JosephAccetta,3," Im sorry, I'm the only one of my friends that liked the prequels and I still admit they're bad. We all enjoyed the Clone Wars on Cartoon Network, but this is the revelation. George Lucas is a whore and this is crap. I'm embarrassed to have payed to see this."
1935,brokeback-mountain-movie,ZiffD.,10," Exceptional movie. Very nicely paced. I was impressed by the particularly adept acting of Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams. Drama and a bit of humor at times (the harmonica jokes), etc. Tragic. People with souls will like this movie. People with hearts will like this movie.  As a straight male and a devout Christian, I can honestly say that my wife and I loved this movie and plan to go with friends to see it again this weekend. I agree with whoever wrote ""This movie was beyond brilliant."" Love is a force of nature and of God. Those who disparrage any of God's children are in urgent need of His grace and have some soul searching to do themselves to determine why their concerns lie so much outside of themselves. We should all remember that ""God looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good."""
1936,venus-movie,ChadS.,8," In a church, Maurice(Peter O'Toole) dances with his oldest and dearest friend, Ian(Leslie Phillips), the one person he's most loyal to. Maurice's adoration for this person isn't a performance like the one he gives for his Valerie(Vanessa Redgrave), his ex-wife. Ever the ham, but so utterly compelling and convincing(his words don't seem processed), he tells Valerie that she's his one true love. But it's all method. His tender emotions bubble up from a wellspring reserved for Jessie(Jodie Whitaker). Even though Valerie is lying, she eats it up. Maurice doesn't truly respect women, but the filmmaker does. In a later scene, she encounters Jodie, and says, ""Oh, you must be the one..."" Art is a lie. Everything that Maurice said to her was a lie but she's touched nonetheless, and so are we, even though this man is clearly a pig."
1937,the-legend-of-hercules-movie,pnetic,3,"And again the best Hercules movie that I ever seen is from Disney.Maybe Disney should do Hercules movie based on their animation or another animation ""Frozen"" style."
1938,lethal-weapon-3-movie,amheretojudge,3,"either non-working or all out of ammo..Lethal Weapon 31 And A Half Out Of 5Lethal Weapon 3 seems an unnecessary installment in the franchise; a decision taken carelessly with nothing but box office in mind but frankly that audience is much smarter that ""good cop bad cop"" routine. The humor is added in here to lighten things up but it is added forcibly with an amateur editing on its side, directing the whole franchise towards the commercial cinema where the big explosives brings big bucks at the cost quality. There isn't a single piece of art to explore in here for there is too much of everything and no amount of nothing; it is lighter on material no matter how crispy. It falls flat on face in its technical aspects like sound department, choreography and editing. One of the main reason it doesn't work is because it lacks a better threat (the antagonist is undercooked in here) to project the appropriate stake to the audience. The screenplay by Jeffrey Boam is hefty on the failed attempts, for it never actually reaches to that scale and addition to that, Richard Donner; the director, seems to be losing its touch with the execution of it. The performance is still up to the mark by the duo Mel Gibson and Donald Glover in their parallel role and Joe Pesci as a supportive cast.Lethal Weapon 3 is either non-working or all out of ammo as it sweats behind the screen to hold the audience for its runtime let along bedazzle them."
1939,the-equalizer-2-movie,Davrosdaleks1,8,"Personally, I enjoyed this sequel as much as the first one, but I can see how this movie might not work for everyone.Surprisingly, the movie bucks the sequel trend by actually having less fight scenes than the original. Yet, it strangely works. The movie doesn't forget the purpose of The Equalizer: focusing on the little guy. A good portion of the film is just Denzel hanging out with people. Although this is an action film, it is also a journey through humanity, both the good and the bad. It doesn't hurt that Denzel as usual gives an excellent performance. He plays a man both charming and intimidating. A man who strives for the light even if he realizes the world may be ultimately grey.The action scenes that do happen do not disappoint. One reason it makes  sense there aren't as many fights is that Denzel's opponents in this film in contrast to the Russian mobsters from the last film have a lot more training and are more on the main character's level and aren't just cannon fodder. The final fight at the end really makes up in my opinion. I think it even rivals the fight at the end of Skyfall.Also, the very empathetic should be forwarned: the murders of civilians get really violent and protracted, more-so-than-usual."
1940,national-treasure-book-of-secrets-movie,Tammy,3, Bland just a repeat of the first one without much credibility to the storyline. Not believable and without suspense. Most of the actors walk through their lines. An example is Harvey Keitel who basically does a cameo in this one. If they had edited him out of the first and put those same lines in this one it would have been the exact same thing. Just a bad movie.
1941,battleship-movie,lahaine2012,2,"I will be brief with this review of Battleship, because there's absolutely nothing worth discussing in this film. The premise and screenplay for this movie was already bad, but director Peter Berg drives this film below the ground. Box office poison Taylor Kitch, True Blood's Alexander Skarsgard, Hottie/singer Rihanna along with the rest of the cast give a collectively dismal performance. Battleship was an empty barrel, riddled with cliches and disdainful dialogue. The dialogue in this was so terrible, one of the characters in the movie had to stop and ask, ' Who talks like that?'. This movie has rightfully been compared to the Transformers films (in fact it was worse), but at least Transformers had exemplary technical elements. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1942,the-green-hornet-movie,moviemonster,10,"There is a lot of ways to describe this film, there really are. But, what is so great about this film is that it is so good, it's indescribable. So . . . See it. End of story."
1943,kong-skull-island-movie,Pablo97121,8,Amazing special effects and scenery. The acting was superb from every emotional angel. Must be on the biggest screen possible with the raddest sound system for full enjoyment.
1944,avengers-infinity-war-movie,manningn15,10,"This is the best Marvel movie ever made. Avengers: Infinity war is my favorite Marvel movie, my favorite superhero movie, my favorite action movie, my favorite sci- fi movie, my favorite fantasy movie, and my favorite movie of all time. The acting was stupendous especially Josh Brolin as Thanos as well as Robert Downey Jr., Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Chris Hemsworth, Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch, Chadwick Boseman, Danai Gurira, Paul Bettany, and Don Cheadle as well as the entire rest of the cast. The action scenes and visual effects were spectacular. The writing, story, and screenplay play were all fantastic. The emotional weight of the story was beautiful, touching, and sad, I even cried a little when Gamora was killed by Thanos and got teary eyed when Peter Parker/Spider-Man was disappearing. The production of the whole movie was great. The direction in which Anthony and Joe Russo took the movies was amazing. The musical score composed by Alan Silvestri was fantastic. Also I loved Stan Lee's cameo as the bus driver, it was perfect. I loved this movie immensely and I can not wait to see the sequel. I hope this wins an Oscar for something like visual effects or the new Best Popular Picture or at the least gets nominated for one. A+."
1945,rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-movie,Udrakan,9,"SPOILER-FREE REVIEW    A movie from Star Wars universe. Recommended whether you saw any previous SW movies or not.    This movie starts a bit weaker but it becomes an absolute masteripiece by the end! Disney wasn't afraid to go into darker events. Yes, this isn't some happy story, this is a WAR story in Star WARS and it's absolutely amazing.    It has all what I wanted from Star Wars: Space Battles, The Force, cool lovable robots, lasers and explosions, deep characters. The Rebelion is shown from a different perspective - they are good guys, but sometimes they do shady and sad stuff to keep them selves alive. This enriches SW universe, where rebels are mostly shown as only good people.    The models and CGI are absolutely amazing. I had shivers going down my spine when I realized just how big Star Destroyer is and then they show Death Star behind it. I was in awe. Skirmishes are clever and Storm troopers are more dangerous and actualy hit people, especialy the elite back ones. Music on-par with movie quality.    Darth Vader is scary again! The scene with him is so epic and intimidating! I don't give this 10/10 for 2 reasons: 1)Weak start - first 15 minutes of film are not as good as the rest, It starts slowly with a remote family story, whcih I would rate 6/10. 2) A little bit of cliche stuff. Although amazingly well done, its another Death Star plot, and I had enough of Death star plot in SW. Even Force Awakens was enough. People in market agressively bumping character's shoulder and then shouting at them-I saw this in so many films, it's a small one, but I noticed it, among other nit-picks.    Overall it's an amazing Star Wars film and even amazing film on it's own. I totaly recommend it. My final verdict is 9/10 - It's a must see."
1946,pans-labyrinth-movie,JackMeHoff,0,"This movie sucked monkey testicles. I would rather be sodomized by a rusty jack hammer than sit throught this piece of crap again! The entire movie was gay and in Mexican. And before you see it, you should smash your face in with a bat, so that you won't remember it."
1947,the-amazing-spider-man-movie,PRADY,1,"This film was boring, drab and there was no real adventure. The first half sucked. Nothing to write abt villain. A superhero movie needs an equally strong and emphatic villain. This movie lacked that."
1948,batman-begins-movie,farzyy12,8,"Absolute perfect reboot of a comic book character into our modern times. Batman Begins reinvents the origin story of Bruce Wayne/Batman and Christian Bale plays a realistic take on the character. While this may not be the perfect Batman from the comic books, as a film, this stands as the best origin story ever told. Liam Neeson plays a perfect Ras Al Ghul. His dialogue, his motivations are what made him a memorable and capable villain for the Dark Knight. The addition of him being Batman's teacher was done superbly and brought a new layer to the character we only thought we knew. The overall direction by Nolan felt ground-breaking to say the least for a comic book movie, and had re-invented the entire scope of what modern comic book characters can be in live-action format. As a first part of a trilogy, this was the perfect start."
1949,dont-be-afraid-of-the-dark-movie,cat78,3,"Hahaha!!!! REALLY!!!!!  Here is an idea, ummmm tear the wall down and go down that freakin hole with a team of suited men and a sh@tload of flashlights and kill those little a@%holes!!! Im sorry but this movie did all the typical things that I was hoping it wouldn't.  Lets see: 1- don't believe your child and just call her crazy, 2-act like there is some unwritten rule saying the child must remain in her room to sleep at all times even if she is terrified of the boogie man! 3-never ask the important questions like, where did you see these things, should we put a lock on the basement door where the big strong handyman got ""accidentally"" hurt, why is there a mini creature arm on the library floor or those weirdos in the pictures our daughter took, how about why is the bathroom curtain all shredded up when sally fell into the tub.....I mean the list goes on and on!! Plus why is going to the library more important than ""get the girl out of the house"", you did go to see Mr handyman for a reason and does the hospital not have nurses that can bandage up cuts properly, old fart is going to die from infection!!! My last complaint(but by far not all of them) why.....oh why do people in times of crisis when needing to leave a home fast pack and fold clothes like they are going on a family vacation! I dont know about you but Im pretty sure if they just walked out the front door they would have all been fine. Ok so another false advertising preview about a haunted creepy home, but it ends up being about a dumba@ father and little gremlin fu@ers that could be easily punted clear across a room!!!"
1950,a-tale-of-love-and-darkness-movie,GreatMartin,2,"When you walk out of a theatre shaking your head and asking yourself, “What was that all about?” a few questions follow such are you so dense you can’t follow the plot of a movie? Or was source material so unreliable? Was the screenwriter just not up to the job or was it the fault of the director? The actors and were interesting to look at and listen to even if you weren’t able to follow the story. Was it the fault of the director? The script? Or????? Natalie Portman stars in “A Tale of Love and Darkness”. Natalie Portman directed “A Tale of Love and Darkness”, her first attempt as a director. Natalie Portman wrote the screenplay for “A Tale of Love and Darkness”, which is the third she has done. Did she take on too much? I am sure there wouldn’t have been funding for the film if she didn’t star in it and many actors want to direct but I think in this case she should have let the screenplay to someone else. Maybe the author, Amos Oz, of the book it is based on, an autobiography of when he was a child, wasn’t available, just didn’t want to do it or Portman felt so deeply about the story she felt she had to write it. We don’t know if the story is being told from the mother’s point of view or maybe the son, an old man now looking back at his childhood or even the young boy himself. Is it a story about the mother and son’s relationship? Or the mother, father and son‘s relationship? Is it about the mother’s illness? Or the fantasy land she inhabits? Is it about the birth of Israel in 1947 and/or the relationships between Arabs and Jews? Is it about the cruelty inflected on the mother by her own mother or the disdain her mother-in-law shows her? A couple of her fantasies, stories that she tells her son, are cruel, while others involve a handsome hero who plays all sorts of roles in her life. Is it about all these things or none of them? With all the above there is not enough emotion to involve the audience with one exception involving the mother in a scene unaware that her son is watching. Portman, the actress, as the mother Fania, Amir Tessler as the 8 year old son Amos, with the exception of a couple of scenes, Gilad Kahana, as the intellectual academic father Arieh, Moni Moshonov, as the old Amos, are all competently directed by Natalie Portman the director as is the ‘handsome hero’ played by Tomer Kapon. She does have a few missteps with Tessler but whether that is her fault as a director or his as a young actor is hard to tell. “A Tale of Love and Darkness” is a film I can only recommend you see so that you can tell me what it was/is about."
1951,wreck-it-ralph-movie,voodoogolfer,10,"Best movie I have seen in years. Funny quips, nostalgic video game characters, comedy for young and old, heartfelt story line. This movie has it all. Disney has a real winner on it's hands. I saw the movie 2 months before release and couldn't want to line up at a theater to pay my money to go see it again. This is a movie you will have to get on Blu-Ray and pause just to catch all the hidden ""easter eggs' if you will. LIke ""No Campers"" written in graffiti on the walls or coins coming out of Sonic when he gets bumped into. The very opening scene blows you away when you go from 2D view of the Fix it Felix Jr. game into the 3D immersive world. Ralph is a great hero to root for and Vanellopee is lovable and cute with just the right amount of feisty-ness. Over a great cast, many laughs, and a great ride into the world of video games new and old."
1952,x-men-apocalypse-movie,Zishah_1990,7,"This is an enjoyable film for everyone. Not the best of the series but truly enjoyable. Quicksilver is back with a unforgettable scene, magneto gets awesome screen time. Humour is well done in this film expect some good chuckles. Overall this movie gives us a acceptable slice of the x-men universe."
1953,solo-a-star-wars-story-movie,Hyzenflay,0,"Really generic movie, and since The Last Jedi left such a bad taste in my mouth, I couldn't stomach this movie.  We walked out halfway, so I had to give it a zero.  It was so boring.  Disney has a mountain of good material from the EU, but instead they churn out this garbage. Tragic"
1954,star-wars-episode-iv---a-new-hope-movie,Pixarlover,10,"Anyone who gave this a negative review were clearly out of their mind or they like Twilight. Who knows? Star Wars... Come on, do I really have to go any further than just saying those two gorgeously combined words? This is where the franchise began. This is where the epic story would continue into many other forms of media beyond film. Star Wars is simply the greatest movie ever made and gave birth to the Hollywood blockbusters we know and love today. A wholly epic piece of cinema that continues to live on after its theatrical release 35 years ago."
1955,guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-movie,Rix397,8,"Despite the often misused humour and a lack of freshness, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is still one of Marvel's strongest movies and showcases great visuals and soundtrack, great character development, introduces the most intresting Marvel villain yet, gives us the most emotional moment in all MCU, while Chris Pratt, Michael Rooker, Kurt Russell and especially Dave Bautista give us great performances."
1956,shrek-the-third-movie,DecepticonPom,1, Excrutiatingly boring.
1957,iron-man-2-movie,gm101,8,"I personally thought it was same old, same old. I didn't love Iron Man 1, but I still liked it. Same goes for this sequel. However, this movie did get me pumped for movies like Thor, Captain America, and the Avengers!"
1958,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,xxajt1,2,"Alright so the simalarities between this movie and episode IV (and a little of V) goes WAY beyond good vs evil trying to blow up a big space station. Lets start from the beginning. We see secret data being handed to a droid who will henceforth be called R2D8. Storm Troopers come in looking for the plans killing many people. We get our first look at the bad guy who will now be called Darth Ren. The bad guys posse who will now be called the Fempire...ok... the Emporder take the original owner of the data hostage for questioning. R2D8 now has to trek through the desert (on a planet that is basically Tatooine) before eventually being found by our protagonist who will now be called Reuk (although Ray also has some of the role that Leia had). R2D8 asks Reuk to bring it back to its original owner who will bring the data to the Resistance (who we will call the resistance because its basically the same thing as rebellion). We have a scene where we see someone being interrogated for the data, an escape from a military ship, a chase scene where a star destroyer shoots at a smaller ship and a crash landing in the desert (yes, all of that happens in both movies just in slightly different orders). Instead of the Data being brought back to its original owner we have the Millennium Falcon being brought back to Han who in this movie takes the place of Obi Wan as the mentor who gets killed at the end by Darth Ren who he has a history with, so we will just call him Obi Han because I think that is funny. There are issues with the hyper drive and we eventually warp to a verdant planet. The giant space weapon which I'm not going to rename from Death Star because Star Killer Base or whatever is  stupid as hell (even more so than Death Star somehow) gets its first use and destroys an important planet. We see a dangerous bar where the Emporder is alerted to the presence of the protagonist. (I think the owner of the bar is supposed to be Han, but I don't know). We have a fight with the Emporder and we see Darth Ren again. The location of the Resistance base is found out and female character is taken to the death star (out of order a little but still). At the rebel base the plans are analyzed. Friends meet (luke had a fighter piolet friend in episode IV who no one remembers that he greets at the base on Yavin) and the Death Star prepares to destroy the base. Darth Ren interrogates female main character and she resists him. Rescue operation begins for female. Assault on the Death Star begins. The assault is literally identical with the trench scene and an identically shaped weak spot that (just like everything else) has to be bigger than in IV because then its cooler. We have an encounter between Darth Ren and Obi Han where Obi Han basically willingly walks to his death. The Death Star explodes and Darth Ren (as well as Grand Moff Ginger which is different) escape. Then they go on to set up Reuk to be trained by a hidden Jedi Master Luda. Darth Ren is obviously going to be redeemed and kill mega emperor (again bigger is cooler) in the future. Some of the ordering is out of place with the Death Star rescue sequence split in two in TFA but pretty much everything else is there. There is a lot of other smaller imagery things and scenes that I'm sure I'm missing because i've only seen it once, but its there. Its the same damn movie and that REALLY makes me mad. Its not just a bate and switch for the fans, its not just a money making sham, but its lazy and safe. I would so much prefer an original script even if it wasn't exactly ""star wars"" that did the one thing this movie failed to do that episode IV did: Be envelope pushing and memorable."
1959,flash-of-genius-movie,Fantasy,7, Good movie not great. GK does another outstanding job. A bit long but otherwise okay with a predictable ending.
1960,whiplash-movie,alexo774,2,"One of the worst and most offensive films I have ever seen. I see where they're going with the direction, and I can see that they tried, but the gay-bashing words, the ridiculousness of the plot, and one of the most overrated actors of our time (Miles Teller) delivering a terrible performance makes this one of the worst movies I've seen in recent times."
1961,looper-movie,Heaviermetal,8,"Nice thing about this movie is that its original and overall good.I felt the movie showcased or built up certain characters that became pointless or underwhelming. lack of time travel technology and the way they cover up the fact made me feel as if they couldn't think of anything. Pacing was to slow at times, even for when they were building good parts, everything else was good for the most part."
1962,rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie,Knicksfan7,9,"Wow, this movie was damn good. James Franco was brilliant and so was the rest of the supporting cast and Rupert Wyatt did an amazing job directing this film. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a brilliant summer blockbuster with loads of action in its final 25 min of its reasonably lengthed hour and 55 minutes. The only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is because i thought it got a little boring and slow in the beginning, but just a little, otherwise this movie enthralled me from the start. This movie was a great way to end off the summer of blockbusters. Even if your not an apes fan go see this movie because anybody can enjoy a great film. 9.5/10"
1963,oceans-8-movie,skobb,2,"No good. The basic message is: It's OK to steal if you get away with it. Of course, the film makers would argue that their job is to entertain, not to deliver a statement about the right way to live. I guess there is a market for that kind of product, but I'm not in it.Also: So many characters were crammed into the plot that none of them had TIME to develop.And finally: I'm amazed that the Met and Cartier were willing to lend their names to this implausible story."
1964,the-equalizer-movie,HotelCentral,8,"I give this film a 7.5 rounded up to 8 because it's nice to see a fictional vigilante serving justice with brains and ingenuity while avoiding most of the primitive cliches we see in virtually every other action flick of the past two decades.This is not the Equalizer of the TV show.  The character is very different, lives very differently, and has been transplanted to Boston.  But this Robert McCall is very much worth knowing and Denzel Washington gives a fine performance.  I recommend this film without reservation."
1965,knock-knock-movie,SebasTheCritic,1,"basically an hour and a half of two women pressuring a man into consensual sex even though he refuses them multiple times then they come back, assault him and then rape him"
1966,war-of-the-worlds-movie,JohnS,2," Aside from the excellent job of things ""blowed up good"" this was a horrible movie. Only watchable when the aliens got on screen, then it was kind of fun. And why do they do this? Smart people like speilberg, the world is being invaded and we have to spend the whole movie listening to an unlikeable family whine to one another. That is not hard to find, so give us the aliens destroying cities, please."
1967,friends-with-money-movie,ArnoldP.,2," I often value and take into account what the critics write but in the case of this film someone missed something. Wonderful ensemble acting, McDormand did create more than a one dimensional character while Aniston in a wildly challenging role only seemed to re-enforce a dullard, poorly porteayed, who like most of the other characters, were too one dimensional. The portrayal of supposedly gay husbands was a joke with no insight or reality. What couples could be so unconscious? Why were these people even friends? One liners and some clever dialogue did not create what could have been a biting satire of manners and money. The question again, why so much praise for so little insight, so little reality. i guess we are hungry for intelligent cinema, which here was a veneer, hollow, empty, creating little empathy for the lives of these sad souls."
1968,the-descent-movie,KellyA.,10," Loved it. I'd heard from friends who had gone to see it on friday that it was scary as hell, and they were right! Great to see a horror film with strong, capable women who can act."
1969,phantom-thread-movie,ourtimehascome,1,"Overrated and passionless, Phantom Thread is boring Oscar bait. Greenwood's soundtrack is fantastic. But the story is trite, and the characters uninteresting. Anderson's worst film to date."
1970,a-bugs-life-movie,beingryanjude,8,"A Bug's Life is an often forgotten Disney masterpiece from the 1990s. The story is a special one--and certainly more perfected than Antz, also released in 1998. The film is both charming and well-rounded."
1971,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,castrovalva,2,"""The Force Awakens"" was a galloping disappointment. I probably won't bother seeing the next two movies because this one had me squirming with boredom. With very little variation, it is a scene-by-scene, plot-point by plot point retelling of ""A New Hope"" and a little bit of ""Empire"". The movie opens with the image of a Star Destroyer crossing the sky. A masked villain at the head of an army of storm troopers is looking for a messenger. The messenger is caught but the message is hidden in a droid which lands on a desert planet. It is found by a poor hero, who rescues it from a small, unintelligible scavenger. Meanwhile, the messenger is rescued from the enemy ship by an unexpected party. The unexpected party and the hero meet and escape on the Millennium Falcon after having a shootout against tie fighters. They meet Han and Chewie. Han is confronted by bounty hunters because he owes money. They have to blast their way out. Han, the mentor, introduces the hero to the ways of the Force. The masked villain seeks counsel from his dark master. The heroes meet up with the rebellion. Their immediate threat is from a spheroid doomsday device which can destroy entire planets, but it has a single weakness which can be used to blow it up. There is a ticking clock as the doomsday weapon has to charge from the sun. (In the original, it had to come around a planet.) Han, the hero’s mentor figure, is slain by the masked villain while the hero looks on. Han is also the former mentor (father) of the masked figure. The hero has an inconclusive fight with the masked villain. The hero is then sent on a quest to find the only living Jedi master. Ho hum. It's also insulting how easily the female protagonist taps into the Force. She stands her ground against the masked villain in a light saber fight even though she has never touched one before. She also uses the Jedi mind-control trick successfully the very first time she attempts it. But that's to be expected since girls have to be superior to boys in every way in Hollywood films. The last three films were all superior to this one. At least they were original."
1972,pixels-movie,Movie1997,3,"Is it any shocker that his latest movie is nothing more than the usual Sandler shtick? Unfortunately no. ""Pixels"" is just another Sandler fest with a bunch of arcade video games from the 80s. It's incredibly unfunny with some of the stupidest sub-plots in any Sandler movie in general. It's also got forced relationships between Adam Sandler and Michelle Monaghan and even Josh Gad and Ashley Benson. And Kevin James is just awful as the President. THE PRESIDENT! As far as the action sequences with the arcade games, they are fantastic to watch. The whole Pac-Man scene in particular is just outstanding to watch (if you ignore the idiotic comedy in between). But what's sad about ""Pixels"", a movie about arcade video games, is that they are barely in the movie. They probably only make up about 25% of the entire movie. The other 75% is focused on our terrible main characters, their childishly idiotic humor and their annoying sub-plots that have nothing to do with a movie about video games attacking earth. Overall, the fun action sequences are mostly pushed to the side thanks the movies terrible writing and crappy characters. I give ""Pixels"" a D-! Be sure to check out my YouTube channel ""LittleMovieBoy for more reviews."
1973,pixels-movie,Mattyice,0,"Not going to even bother giving my pros or cons with this film because everything sucks in it. Adam Sandler continues to ruin everything he touches. He's lazy, boring, and needs to leave hollywood now. Horrible casting choices (Kevin James has no place as the President in any universe), terrible plot considering the concept, and an overall disgrace to video games. Worst film I've seen in 2015 without any doubt in my mind."
1974,terminator-2-judgment-day-movie,HectorInTheMorn,10,"One of the Greatest Action Films Ever Made and One of the Greatest Films Ever Made. The Action that is directed in this movie is extremely exciting, the performances by the actors is very real, Arnold is the Terminator/T-800, and the writing for this film is fleshed out perfectly!"
1975,independence-day-resurgence-movie,Leondy,10,"this is easily one of the best movies I've ever watched.Peoples keep liking some dickhead like Conjuring.But not this? what the hell people? Heck,I'll even give this more than 10 scores if I could."
1976,encounters-at-the-end-of-the-world-movie,DougN.,9," Werner Herzog doing his usual thing. Much better than the penguin movie last year. He explores the usual off beat characters, plus the beautiful landscape. Excellent."
1977,city-of-ember-movie,MovieLonely94,7,"when it first came out, people enjoyed watching this movie. after that, it didn't even became one of the highest grossing movies of 2008 since it got overshadowed by another movie The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. so, what about this movie? well, it lacks on both action and adventure, but as a fan of movies based on books like Harry Potter, Narnia, and The Lord of the Rings, I say it is a good one and its sticks to the source material from the book. Rating: 7/10"
1978,transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-movie,DaveB,0, This movie is as dumb as paint.
1979,amelie-movie,EstebanF,3," Horribly boring and dumb, this is a movie that tries to be what it isn't: an artistic production. After 30 minutes of it, you just want to stop. The story is just too ""pink"", simply too ""happy"" to stand it. 0 realism, dumb, it doesn't challenge the audience and it doesn't make you feel anything but boredom. Soul-less, failed artistic wannabe movie."
1980,knight-of-cups-movie,neowolfone,9,"A film of the genre ""Terrence Malik"". Like his other films he is about finding oneself, finding a way, loving, living, understanding the meaning and yourself."
1981,marley-me-movie,CarolS,3," Found it predictable; no chemistry between Aniston and Wilson. I love dogs...found Marley's antics and his ""parent's"" inability to control him tiresome."
1982,k-pax-movie,marc5477,7,"Good movie overall about a man who thinks he is an alien. The entire movie is about trying to figure out if he is nuts or really an alien. I wont give anything away for people who have not seen it, but it is a good movie and the lingering question keeps you interested all the way to the end. Kevin Spacey did a great job and the movie was overall well above average to me (5 being average on sites with lots of reviews). Its not as good as The Man from Earth, which had a similar plot but better dialog, but it was still a fun movie to watch."
1983,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,X_Jormungandr_X,0,"I didn't expect much from this, and i was right. They took some things from all of the previous Star Wars movies and tried to pretend it was a completely new and unique movie, while they of course made sure it was 100 % political correct. It's such an overrated movie because really it's silly how bad both the writing and the acting is. Rey is apparently this amazing wonderchild that beats every opponent without any practice whatsoever. She defeats Kylo Ren who is a sith student basicly the first time she uses a lightsaber. The movie is dumb, i don't think i need to say much else."
1984,real-steel-movie,Badgerbrad,9,"Here is what you get when you see this movie:  You get to be with moviegoers that will cheer and clap out loud (when is the last time that happened).  You get great fight scenes. Real life Rock'em Sock'em Robots. You get the desire to stand up and throw a punch yourself.  You may get a tear in your eye.  If you go with your son, you get to watch him go through every emotion in two hours then talk about every minute of it for the next two hours. You get to watch a very good movie and you get your monies worth.  Again, when is the last time that happened?  No academy awards with this one, but you'll have some priceless snapshot moments with your family."

If you have any standards for a script or dialogue or story, don't see this movie. No story, such stupid corny dialogue, the action may use cgi but it's really bad. Could not make it through the whole movie and left. So bad!"
1987,the-post-movie,BHBarry,8,"“The Post” stars Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in this bio-drama written by Liv Hannah and Josh Singer and directed by Steven Spielberg. This film is more than the story of the publishing of the infamous Pentagon Papers for it relates to the role of Kathryn Graham, the first female publisher of a major newspaper, and the culture that brought her to that position, as well as the basic issues of press freedom and whether any one person in government can be more powerful than the media and its position in our society. Ms. Streep, as Mrs. Graham, and Mr . Hanks. as Ben Bradlee, render superb performances as protectors of the public’s right to know. For anyone growing up in this era and for those who are unfamiliar with the events of the time, it is a story well told as Mr. Spielberg educates and entertains the audience. For all of those reasons. I give the film an 8.0 rating and recommend that it be viewed by as many as possible."

1989,frozen-2013-movie,yasminetaylorx,10,"I think that frozen is a good film because it is suitable for all ages its a good family film and it has a interesting story line to it, it shows young people that to be saved by love it does not have to be a person of the opposite sex and can in fact be your sister that can save your life. I love watching this film and there are good songs with it and I also never get bored of watching it."

1993,gattaca-movie,pinattar,9,"a really under-rated sci-fy film set in a dystopian society. great acting all round , really intriguing premise and excellent set design and cinematography. the only problem i have is how come no one recognizes ethan hawke?, that really bothered me. other than that great film."
1994,jason-bourne-movie,AxeT,2,"Besides the recycled wafer thin plot and dumb sub comic book dialogue, this thing is shot and edited so poorly the people responsible prove unfit to be crafting feature films much less big budget Hollywood blockbusters.  It is an injustice the incompetent director is allowed to make movies.  His signature style was used to appropriate effect in ""United 93"" and somehow didn't ruin the excellent ""Captain Phillips"" (10 rating here), but that may be because that was not an action movie and Greengrass didn't have justification to warrant going overboard on the visceral moving cam - cut to ribbons bull---- style of his.  Also an important factor is that real events re-created is an entirely different frame of mind than big dumb popcorn fiction like this movie, which no matter how much phony reality is artificially injected into the moviemaking, we all never forget this s---- is all play pretend time make believe.  Whatever the case, this idiot is a menace to cinemas most of the time.  Nobody in power bothers to really question the s----- style.  Not the studio monkeys, not the producers, not the stars.  All a herd of sheep producing pure manure that only fertilizes their jackass egos, certainly not the audience.  Kinetic action does not require shaky dumbed down cell phone quality documentary vérité.  The eye doesn't even truly ever see that way no matter how jostled.  Nor does the audience deserve to be paying admission to only be annoyed and sickened by it!  This already passé style of cinematic action doesn't raise the bar, it lowers it idiots!  It's incoherent and unintelligible!  You can't even tell what's going on most of the time!  And it's easier to manufacture this kind of bs handheld photography and anything goes editorial.  Total junk!By comparison, the first movie in the series made by others and without this s--- style was good (7 rating) and the last one also directed by another without this s--- style and with a different lead actor was marginal but not infuriating (maybe a 5). Damon though a very good actor and maybe very solid person in life is simply not likable enough a personality on screen to have ever become a real movie star.  Disagree with that, but he just isn't in the same league as movie stars past which points to a larger issue at the movies today. What an excruciating, unbearable soulless bore!  For all the nonsense stupid style trying to liven things up, this movie could not be more dead on arrival.  The only reason it rates 2 here is because it does get even worse as we know."
1995,bobby-movie,DennisP.,3," The only worthwhile part of ""Bobby"" was RFK's anti-violence speech at the end. Unfortunately, the previous 2 hours involve pointless scenes of people buying shoes, getting haircuts and taking about baseball. You also get the most ridiculous LSD trip in movie history. The story of Bobby Kennedy deserves a much better film than this."
1996,the-amazing-spider-man-2-movie,MovieGuys,3,"The first thing I thought when the credits rolled for ""The Abysmal Spiderman 2"" was, ""I paid money to see this?""  This is the worst of the Spiderman movies ever. It is one of the most non-sensical, not cohesive, incoherent, and confusing movies I have seen since I can remember. The whole story was nothing but cliché after cliché after cliché. I give credit to the people involved in this tragedy for piling on the most clichés possible in this movie. And the love story between Peter and Gwen: ugh, I might as well have watched a bad soap opera. The villain in this one, Electro, played by the wonderful Mr. Jamie Foxx, is wasted in this movie and seems like more of an afterthought. How Foxx accepted being in this movie is beyond reason. And who wrote the script? They should never be allowed in Hollywood ever again. This is literally some of the dialogue in the movie, and believe me, there are no spoilers here. ""I can't let you do this. It's too dangerous."" ""Is that all you got?"" ""Wait, wait! I know my way out."" ""It's going to be okay"" ""I will destroy you, Spiderman!"" The only thing that I did like in the movie, which is preventing me from giving it a 0, are the slow motion scenes. They are impressive from a technical standpoint, if only they weren't followed by a scene with a (wait for it) cliché!"

1998,resident-evil-the-final-chapter-movie,Cheetahice,1,This movie wasn't that great I think it was the worst film in the franchise. The commercials on tv showed the best parts but hid the rest of the terrible parts of the film.
1999,a-clockwork-orange-movie,bill,10, This is indeed one of Stanley Kubrick best films. Malcom Macdowell was cast perfectly as Alex del Large and I can't believe he didn't get an Acadamy Award nomination for this role. Truly a classic.
2000,elektra-movie,SuperheroMovies,3,"Uninteresting, uninspired, and just wholly unnecessary, Elektra is a painfully predictable spin-off of an already mediocre Daredevil film, that despite some decent fight scenes, is full of lifeless acting and bland dialogue."
2001,terminator-genisys-movie,Rebecca31,0,"Ranting levels critical, you’ve been warned: So today I went to see the 5th installment in what was once an amazing franchise, who’d have thought that they could sink any lower than Terminator 4, but they can in this spectacular fail of a movie. At no point did anyone expect this to be any good, the trailer saw to that but I don’t think anyone could predict how bad it truly is. There are no adequate words but I’m gonna go for it anyway. So Arnie is back (in his many forms) to do what he does best, except this time he’s called Pops, now if this wasn’t a warning bell it pretty much explains why the rest of the movie was so terrible. Not only is this film horrifying on its own but it has to take Terminator 2 and in particular Terminator 1 and drag it through the dirt. It can’t even establish itself as anything new, taking great scenes from the classics and rehashing them hoping the fans will be too caught up in the moment to notice. It singlehandedly destroys the first two Terminator movies and leaves us with this horrendously traumatizing and soul crushing sorry excuse for a movie.What’s that Arnie? You’ll be back, somehow I don’t think so. You know what I hope the machines do rise up and kill all humans cause if this is the standard for films in the future then I don’t want to be a part of it. Not recommended, I repeat, this film is not recommended for viewing as to do so is not only dangerously infuriating but can also put viewers at risk of potentially giving into the urge to gouge one’s own eyes out. Rant over."
2002,i-frankenstein-movie,FilipeNeto,2,"When I was a kid, there was an kids television show called ""Gargoyles"". Readers who have been children (or have been parents) during the nineties should probably remember it. Well, this movie looks like a mix of this show with ""Frankenstein"". The whole plot is pretty stupid, with cathedral gargoyles that stay alive and wage epic battles against demons in the sight of humans (who curiously never realize anything). This is not the first time Frankenstein's story has been used to give life to anything dead in a movie. ""Van Helsing"" is another film where the same feature is used in the same way, and with equally bad results. It seems that the Frankenstein machine works for everything, which is absolutely ridiculous. So, from a bad idea, this movie was doomed at birth.Aaron Eckhart and Miranda Otto are the big stars of the film. He plays the role of Adam, the creature created by Frankenstein, who joins the gargoyles led by Otto's character, Queen Leonore. Both actors made fairly regular performances, without major failures but also without positive surprises. Otto seems particularly cold and impersonal in her role. The strongest part of the film are the action and fighting scenes, sprinkled abundantly with CGI, explosions and great sound effects. In fact, these scenes have been done carefully and are spectacular, but they are not enough to justify the film or make it good. The dark and Gothic environment will please the fans of this subculture, the action scenes will attract teenagers thirsty for fights and explosions, but no more. The audience that looks for some depth, logic or cinematic sense will probably come out disappointed."
2003,meet-the-browns-movie,ChadS.,3," Filmmaker Tyler Perry is the Kurt Cobain of American cinema. Like ""Nevermind"", Perry's films perform beyond the niche market it was intended for. 2002 became the year ""black film"" broke, when ""Diary of a Mad, Black Woman"" grossed over fifty-million dollars, a then-unprecednted sum for a black independent film. Perry's movies are mainstream, but make no mistake about it, ""Meet the Browns"" is a ""cult film"" at its core, like Nirvana was an ""alternative"" band, who suddenly became wildly popular. While other indies enjoy wide-release success, the Perry oeuvre differs in this very important respect: The audience that Perry caters to is often a disenfranchised one. We're talking about African-American women. ""Meet the Browns"" is a black chick-flick. In the last six years, Perry has created his own private Hollywood by being a blaxploitation director who makes respectable films for a middle-brow audience. With ""Meet the Browns"", Perry alienates the fanbase, in a scene, in which the oldest son of the family patriarch refers to his father's women as ""hos"", in a naked attempt to be all things to all people. Being black himself, Brown should realize that no respectable ""gangsta"" would be caught dead at ""Meet the Browns"", so why rankle the converted with a street lexicon? In another scene, Madea is being chased by a convoy of police squad vehicles and excitedly proclaims, ""I'm going to be on ""Cops""!"" This is Chapelle-lite. This is like Wayne Brady's performance as a gangbanger on ""The Dave Chapelle Show"". Perry is satirizing his own ""vanilla"" image by being an outlaw. But gangsta rap and incarceration infringes on the fantasy aspect of a single mother of three who goes to Georgia and lives happily-ever-after. That's not what the audience paid for."
2004,carol-movie,LeZee,7,"Just when it can't get any better... The first thing I noticed was after seeing the movie is there's some kind of mistake in the Oscars nominee. Rooney Mara should have been on the lead role list, while Cate Blanchett in the supporting character's. Maybe the Academy people misunderstood that the title role must be the lead character. Theirs switched place actually does not make any sense. Anyway the Oscars never made sense at all. This story was okay, but adapted screenplay and direction, especially the music was excellent. For the ending scene alone, you will be tempted to raise your rating than what you initially thought it deserves. I was not expecting the movie to be awesome, so I'm not upset for the overall movie. Believe me, the last thing I want in this movie is to see Cate Blanchett in naked. Maybe out of respect or her age or she's not attracted to me, there are plenty of reasons that I can't figure it out which one, but after knowing what this theme is, I was only praying for that not to happen. And obviously that is unavoidable, otherwise the movie will lose its soul and strength. Well, it was better than I thought, both the actresses were good, but Rooney Mara dominated. Whatever category she's in for the Oscars, I'll be happy if she wins. It is not a must watch, but a decent movie and betters in some parts. 7/10"
2005,the-accountant-movie,bfoore90,10,"I went to this movie with very little to no expectations of it being good and suffice to say, I was wrong. Led by a stellar performance by Ben Affleck,who brought his A game in this movie. The Accountant is overall a tense, emotionally charged albeit a bit unconventional thriller but its also deeply character driven. I can see where people could be bothered with the pacing and the editing a bit but overall I found the Accountant to be a very fun and entertaining as hell movie."
2006,rain-man-movie,ExKing,7,this is a great movie  i liked the story  i liked the performances and i think it was the best performance of tom cruise i have seen so far which is a horrible thing cause from this movie you can see that he can actually act  so i don't know why he have a messed up career with risky pointless movies just to fill his wallet maybe. and i don't know why people keeps criticizing Dustin hoffman i think he did a tremendous job in this movie  he could not do it better.
2007,moonrise-kingdom-movie,GreatMartin,3,"Can you walk into a movie theatre, park your logic at the door, and accept that a boy could be struck directly with lightning and just wind up with a dirty face and clothes?

2008,extremely-loud-and-incredibly-close-movie,MovieGuys,9,"Some may say the emotion is sappy, but that's just because what you would expect from a movie like this. The story is something we all feel for on a national level, and we sympathize with all who were effected by it. The movie really makes you feel for the characters and the emotion is real. The way the story presents itself and the little quirky things Oskar does will probably make some of us cry by the end. Well done."
2009,mission-impossible-5-movie,BB_Critic,8,"Tom Cruise is back for his 5th entry in the Mission Impossible franchise, and not like most sequels, this one does not disappoint. It exceeded my expectations by a long shot and delivered some incredible action sequences. Not as good as Ghost Protocol, but still a very fun time at the movies"
2010,end-of-watch-movie,Enforcer122,10,Amazing film. It's one of those films which doesn't fully hit you how great it is until the end. They achieved so much with it considering they had a small budget. Well worth a watch!

2015,martian-child-movie,JoeB.,10, John Cusack is a real artist! He plays this father simply great - non-plus-ultra! He is unique and the whole story touched me to tears. A File for men (maybe more than for women) Greetz from Germany.
2016,harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-movie,SurajG,10," This movie was awesome and better than ""Order of the Phoenix"", which should have been made into two parts."
2017,this-is-england-movie,DavidM.,8," I agree that the scenes of the boy kissing the older girl was slightly odd. She wasn't 18 though but rather fifteen. Also, being a skinhead doesn't make you a racist so it is not unusual for them to have a black friend at all. Anyone who does a bit of research will know that the history of skinhead culture is very blurred and has its roots in west indian culture. There are and always have been both racist and anti racist skinheads and for me this film illustrates this well. More importantly though I think it is beautifully shot film that is full of fantastic acting."
2018,ruby-sparks-movie,RoraEst,10,"Zoe Kazan is really a great writer. This movie was so perfect in many ways. The directing, the cinematography, the soundtracks, the script, the angles, all of them were so fit that made this movie was phenomenal. The climax, they nailed it. Screwed my mind for a month or longer. I cried. This comedy movie made me cry. How was that even possible?! Paul Dano was really awesome. His acting on this movie was his best so far. Most of his characters from his other movies look similar, kind of a depression character or something, but in this movie, he gave me a new exciting and his real original act, like nobody could act this character except him. He's enchanted. I do love the cinematography. I thought this movie should get lots of awards. I thought Paul Dano and Zoe Kazan should get many awards. Thank you."
2019,notes-on-a-scandal-movie,Nadie,10," Extraordinary perfomance by the best living actress, Judi Dench. You don't know if you love her or hate her, you only know she is a bitter and lonely school teacher looking for love in all the wrong places. She gave acting classes to Helen Mirren many year ago, well I don't know what she's waiting to do it again."
2020,juno-movie,MovieBuff36,9,"Ellen Page shines as Juno MacGuff! She delivers a bright and shiny performance. I don't know if many audience members are aware of this, but Diablo Cody, who wrote the screenplay for this film was inspired by her life when she was 16 and pregnant in which it shows exactly what can happen during pregnancy and how it can guiltily affect your boyfriend that got you pregnant from sexual intercourse. Juno MacGuff acts like she doesn't care if she's pregnant, but she was smart about it and she does act like she is facing the challenges of being pregnant and she still does care about her boyfriend, Paul Bleeker (Michael Cera). Paul Bleeker still cared about her also. He felt guilty about getting her pregnant, but they still love each other and Page and Cera play cool characters. But what's great is the coming-of-age-type of love story between the two where they have great and intelligent chemistry with each other. And where the film's soul comes from is from the strong character development between the two from start to finish and where she faces a lot of hard decisions about being pregnant around her family and friends and between giving it up for adoption or the other. And strangely enough, it was romantically funny between the two. It's directed like a sitcom, but Jason Reitman makes a wonderful image out of it; especially the hilarious and moving performances of Michael Cera and Ellen Page and the impressive dialogue. Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is obnoxious as hell, but Ellen Page was great at her emotions and her obnoxious, yet very smart and intelligently written script. And hey, thanks to Diablo Cody's writing that was inspired by her 16 and pregnant life, it was well done with Juno MacGuff's smartitude, because her smartitude is what made her smart about her pregnancy. Diablo Cody's writing is also what made the script intelligently clever, smart, and not funny but beyond that: Hilarious! To give the audience an experience of being pregnant during high school, it gets the job done with impressive writing from Diablo Cody that made it so smart and intelligent. The love story between Juno and Paul was well-inspired. Especially due to the fact they played great characters. If you hate this wonderful movie, I would feel bad for you because where is your soul? Let me remind you haters this is a very touching movie that gives you clues of what being 16 and pregnant is like since it shows exactly what can happen when a some is pregnant - even when she gave birth and the guilt her boyfriend faced. Besides, wasn't it emotionally intense when she gave birth? Because this film shows how pregnancy can be in every way effective. Besides, It is romantically funny between Juno and Paul, so don't underestimate their character development and chemistry either, because hating this movie would be just soulless. Besides, like I said, she is obnoxious as hell, but she is cool like that, she's bright, sweet, charmingly and cleverly funny, smart, and intelligent. You would be an idiot to underestimate Juno MacGuff's awesome personality. Also, DO NOT underestimate Diablo Cody's superb writing and/or the romantic development between Juno and Paul either! Even if you hate the film considering Juno to be annoying, you are still an idiot, because she is very cool like Ellen Page. One of the coolest things about her is hamburger phone: that was clever as hell! I honestly think Juno was flawed, but thanks to Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody, writing and acting inspired from life of someone (yes, Diablo Cody) who was pregnant at age 16 gives it a coherent soul to captives your heart into a wonderfully explanatory experience of teenage pregnancy - especially since it shows how teenage pregnancy can be both personally and emotionally effective - even on your friends and family - well done by it's sweet and charming qualities - and Ellen Page, who helped made it sweet and charming due to her character and performance. Thank her and the rest of the cast also! And you know what, how can you hate this? You would be a disgrace to hate it. This movie has soul and it would be the perfect movie to watch in Health class in High School to give students clues of teenage pregnancy. Hating this movie, would be soulless. Shame on ANYONE who hates Juno! And yes, I mean you also! You haters would just make me sick! Although you haters may find Juno annoying: She is actually very sweet and clever! DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HER and/or Ellen Page. Especially Diablo Cody's writing. That would just make you haters inconsiderate with no soul. And haters, have you seen the show 16 and Pregnant on MTV? If so, that TV show ACTUALLY shows what I mentioned about teen pregnancy before and depicts it between Juno &amp; Paul. I would also like to point out again that the screenplay of this film was inspired by Diablo Cody's life as a 16 year-old pregnant girl so think twice before you hate."
2021,deja-vu-movie,MichaelP.,9," My thanks goes to Devin (below). The other reviews were so bad I almost didn't go see this movie. But I did go, based on Devin's comments, and he nailed it. As he said, if you like movies that make you think a little bit while you're watching, and you're a fan of techno-thrillers with lots of action, you'll like this movie. Admittedly, it's not for everyone--if you go to films so you can mentally flat-line and have everything spelled out to you in a way that even a moron could understand, then you probably won't like Deja Vu. Stay home and gaze blankly at reality TV or drool in front of your Nintendo game instead. Thanks again, Devin!"
2022,untitled-taken-sequel-movie,Knicksfan7,3,"I went into this movie expecting a brainless but fun action film. Well all i got was brainless. This movie wasn't even fun. I'm a big Liam Neeson fan, especially when hes kicking ass and honestly the action sucked in this sequel to the overrated but fun first entry into the series. I even think im being generous giving it a 3. I'm not one to look for believability in a movie like taken 2 but come on, some of the crap was unbearable. The daughters using fregen grenades and nobody in istanbul seems to give a crap like chicks chuck grenades around the city on a daily basis, and how the daughter who keep in mind has failed her road test 3 times as was mentioned earlier in the film, all of a sudden becomes the worlds best getaway driver in this seemingly indestrcutible taxi that no matter what it crashes into there will never be a scratch on it. It was just unbearable. I'll give it a 3/10 which is definitely being more than generous, don't waste your time or hard-earned money!"
2023,world-war-z-movie,ManSpider,7,"I'm going to be honest, I came into this movie with pretty low expectations, and a whole bunch of negative preconceptions. The opening scenes, with piss poor character development and dialogue, a token, barely explained Mexican family, further accompanied by one of the fastest, jarring movie escalations I've ever seen barely helped my opinion here. However, I stuck with it, forcing myself to grit through these early pitfalls, and to my surprise the movie actually got quite a bit better after it was done tripping over itself in the first 20 minutes. Whilst character development remained poor at best, the protagonist travelled to a whole variety of interesting locations, which gave way to some incredibly tense action sequences throughout the film. Huge props to the special effects team on this one. Overall, the writing was sub par, and one scene in South Korea involving Navy Seals felt like a first person shooter right wing nationalist circle jerk, giving off a feel of ""hey look how cool and badass our special forces are!!  yeah America!!"" However, the film was saved through its plot sequence and variety of characters and locations, serving to keep each scene fresh somewhat unexpected."
2024,phone-booth-movie,DuggieB,9, Wow! A thriller the whole way. One of the better movies I've seen lately.
2025,repo-man-movie,JLuis_001,7,"A strange mix totally made in its time and for its time, that surprisingly works despiteits austerity but has something that many films lack, a good and entertaining plot in which Emilio Estevez delivers the best I've seen of him probably in all his career."
2026,the-hills-have-eyes-movie,JordanA.,10," I absolutely loved this movie. Probably one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. Great plot, and the gore and intensity level is just over the top. The ending was kind of confusing, but it was still good, knowing there are more out there. The number 2 doesn't look as good though."
2027,happy-go-lucky-movie,Hollyc,7," Interesting that most people seem to either love or hate this film. I don't generally enjoy Mike Leigh Films---they have no plot, and revel in ""every-day-ness"" and HGL is still in that vane, though I think it had a lot more plot then usual. Like many, I started off thinking this character was annoying--and like a lot of people who try to be open and generous--positive, sometimes it comes across as irritating and an affectation (so I liked how Hawkins played this character&amp; forces you to react to her). However, the real ""plot"" surrounds the ""tests"" Poppy goes through w/ others as we follow her. I do think she genuinely grows throughout the film and I did warm to her. I thought the driving instructor was the centerpiece of the story, the basic antithesis of her--so that dynamic was incredible to watch unfold. Overall, I thought Hawkins and the driving guy--Marsen were brilliant. Liked the character study and meditation on optimism/happiness, but don't particularly enjoy how Leigh tells ""stories"". Worth a rental."
2028,dont-breathe-movie,dunnyone,1,"Am I living in an alternate universe, where everyone has been gifted with sub-moron level IQs? And therefore, films like Don't Breathe are universally praised. Don't Breathe is a massive pile of dung, with awful characters, poor plot and not even a single character to root for. The main woman, who we are supposed to get behind, is an awful thief and Stephan Lang is simply defending his home. It's nonsensical, non-scary and has one okay-ish scene (the turkey baster). Movies these days are awful and Don't Breathe is no exception."
2029,inside-out-2015-movie,DaMovieLover,10,"Inside Out is arguably of the studio's best films yet to date. Original, ingenious, and sentimental, the studio has return with a smart and winning comeback after its 1 year delay of producing animation flicks since its last work (Monsters University). This proves that Pixar's magic is still fresh and will make animation cinema a delightful treat for the young and the matured. Great job Pixar for revitalizing your delayed record of fantastic animated movies. Rating: 9.5 / 10"
2030,the-way-way-back-movie,SimpleMethod,10,"I love The Way, Way Back. It's the first 10/10 I'm awarding all year and for a good reason. All around the board spectacular performances, Sam Rockwell particularly shines. I loved it."

2032,raging-bull-movie,1966Zodiac,1,"This movie SUCKED!! I'm sorry I'm totally going against the crowd on this one. It's boring &amp; long and it felt like a chore watching it. I really wanted to like it. I really tried, but you know what if a movie is really that good (according to critics)why should you try to like it? Man I freakin hate this movie. ALL boxing movies are better than this crap Rocky 1-6, Million Dollar Baby, and The Fighter are MUCH better. I know why the critics love this movie because it's bold and so vastly different from any other film. You know what that's very true. It is bold and vastly different, but in a VERY BAD way. (semi-spoiler) It's literally just about a douchebag boxer. He doesn't go though a change or journey or anything it just shows his life. He beats his brother &amp; wife. He cusses alot. He kisses an underage girl(well she really didn't look underage) and the movie literally just ends in a random spot. I don't even care about the real story now because he was such a douche.However, he wasn't like an awesome villain douche or anything. It's not like he was the Joker,Hannibal Lecture, or Darth Vader. He was simply a douche that I didn't care about, and wasn't interested in. This movies overrated and people are just saying it's a masterpiece to follow the trend. Well Fk that. Eff this movie and Eff what the critics say. I respect peoples opinions, and if you like this movie fine. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions.  Just don't annoy me about it to watch it because I did and it was a terrible waste of my time."
2033,thor-ragnarok-movie,ludwig63,3,"A funny film, but basically almost a parody of ""real"" Thor. It seems a spin-off from Guardians of Galaxy. The target has obviously downgraded to teen/child. Where is the pathos and grandeur of Kenneth Brannagh's great first Thor?"

2035,into-the-wild-movie,CoreyC.,3," Beautifully shot and well-directed. The character, however, confuses self-actualization with simple selfishness. At his core, McCandless was weak-minded and sought to flee rather than face his problems; everyone has a childhhod with difficulties, many far, far worse than poor Supertramp's. Forgiveness is a truly arduous challenge that he never bothered to face. What a shame."
2036,drag-me-to-hell-movie,RAM3001,0,"This was the only movie I have ever shut off half way through. It was the cheesiest, campiest, worst acted and laughably directed pile of fecal matter of a film I have ever had the misfortune of encountering. Wow - I cant believe people actually liked this awful excuse for a film. It makes me want to scream when characters act ridiculously to events that befall them. Spoiler Alert: Like Lohman's character the day after being viciously gummed and stabbing an old lady in the neck... ""Maybe I should have given her an extension on that loan...""   WHAT???  You stabbed an old witch in the neck!!!! Are you kidding me? The writers should have listen to this trash on continuous playback for all eternity. I can't imagine a worse hell."
2037,hereafter-movie,ItsMuchMore,7,"Communicating with the dead? It’s what alot of people say they can do, and more wish they were telling the truth. Hereafter is a film that tells three stories that all relate to communicating with the dead, and tell a parallel story with one another. We have a American based past Clairvoyant now factory worker, a French television journalist who had a near death experience, and British twins touched by tragedy. All of main the scenes that lead to the events that intertwine this story are both shocking, and inadvertently brought to life but how realistic they look. Directed by Clint Eastwood, Hereafter doesn't seem to build on the premises of the story of life after death, and i don't think it ever wanted to force feed answers, but more make you raise you own questions, The stories seem believable, and will keep you interested from start to finish. Hereafter is worth a watch for someone who is looking to get away from ‘Life’ for a little bit.Full Review @ItsMuchMore"
2038,iron-man-3-movie,HawkeyeWii,8,"I feel like I need to give this movie two separate scores. One of r people that have no idea about the Iron Man comics and one for those that do. The movie is top notch as far as the action, humor, and acting goes. The plot I feel was the weakest part of the movie. Also I think the trailers for this movie are the most misleading that I have ever seen for a movie. They advertise Mandarin out to be the main bad guy, or at least a bad guy at all. It turns out the only reason that ""The Mandarin"" was in the movie was to be a joke. For those of you that don't know, The Mandarin is to Iron Man what the Joker is to Batman. So why they chose to do this to Iron Man's archnemesis is beyond me. I think this is the weakest entry in the series, but regardless go see this movie! It may be the last time you get to see Robert Downey Jr. play as one of the greatest characters the cinema has ever seen!"

Definitely not as good as the first film, it is about on the same level as the second. The action sequences could have been handled better and some of the acting was quite stale. Blackbeard however was the biggest disappointment of the film; he wasn't Bristolian enough and didn't seem too evil.The film was not a disappointment but a surprise, I hope they make a sequel to improve on this one."

Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe helped Shane Black to do one of the Best Movies of 2016 and one of the funniest movies so far."

Apparently you will either love or hate this movie, not much middle ground. Me, like others posted, hated it - it was a dreary, growning waste of 2 hours. I say revoke the Coen's movie making privledges."

Neeson's stereotypical role is getting really tired."

2049,the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-movie,chris10000,9,"An Unexpected Journey is a welcome return to Middle-Earth and the most exciting film of the year.  I've seen the Avengers and TDKR and while I would say that Avengers is a better film (9/10), The Hobbit had me awe inspired on multiple occasions.  It's not as good as LOTR, that's a fact.  Those are three 9+/10 films but The Hobbit is still a great film nonetheless and one which makes me eagerly await seeing it again and anticipate it's sequels.  The critics' maniacally biased reviews have clearly put a lot of people off and while the film is not without it's flaws, they made mostly nonsensical points.  The majority of the negative reviews focused on the frame rate rather than the actual film.  Another dumb, ironic criticism is that the critics said they were fans of Tolkien but didn't understand why The Hobbit was light in some places.  It's an adaptation of a light book and including information that Tolkien belatedly added to the era in the appendices, the film is one of the most faithful works I've ever seen.  Of course Jackson took some liberties but most of them were for the better.  The Rivendell scene, whilst I thought that the script was a little lacking, was essential to start recognising and confronting the problem of the Necromancer. Having 13 dwarves and making them all fully fledged characters in one film was an impossible task and as a result many such as Bombur do not even say a word, yet Thorin, Balin, Bofur, Dwalin, Ori, Fili and Kili had a much greater focus.  I'm sure that the others shall have their time to shine in the following films.  Martin Freeman as Bilbo captured the essence of the character very well and Ian McKellen as Gandalf was as good as ever and brought me back to Fellowship-Gandalf, which was the character's best. After all, Grey has much more personality than White.  The prologue showcasing Erebor and Smaug's attack had me immediately filled with a sense of wonder as if I had never left Middle Earth.  The brief flashback of the battle outside Moria was another excellent demonstration of PJ's fluency with action scenes and you could literally focus on any one-on-one between the dwarves and orcs and be entertained.  Azog was a fantastic addition and made you feel a real sense of danger for the company as well as a feeling of being hunted, adding more gravity and resonance to the group's mission.  The stand out scene of the film was Gollum's return to the screen, which was arguably the best we've ever had the character.  Whether humorous or dangerous he was just captivating, creating the most memorable scene of the year. The pacing was excellent and the Shire scene, which caused some controversy concerning its length, flew by, ending just at the right time.  I was only aware of the length when the film stopped still after they had left the caves and caught their breaths for about 15-20 seconds.  What followed was the most unexpected part of the movie; having read the book, I expected the eagles to rescue them pretty quickly, but I was just waiting and waiting, all the while the tension was reaching a climax.  Thorin, choosing to die in battle and facing his foe rather than falling off a cliff, charging down to confront Azog was such a powerful moment and made me realise how invested I'd become over the course of the film.  By the end, with the Lonely Mountain in sight, I felt the same way that I had at the end of Fellowship; that I had a long way to go before the finish, but so much had happened that I was completely satisfied.  I give An Unexpected Journey an 8.5/10."
2050,spider-man-2-movie,Sonic45X,10,"10 years later and it's still one of the best if not the best Spider-Man movie ever and in my opinion the best super hero movie. it has great action, a great story, a great cast of characters and great music to top it all off. If your a Spider-Man fan (or just love super hero movies) and haven't watched the movie, (or if you haven't seen it in a long while) than I strongly recommend getting the film."
2051,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,rpotter1000,9,"I'm sure plenty of people are sincerely disappointed, but there has to be a huge amount of manufactured disappointment here, but because I found this movie deeply satisfying as a life-long Star Wars fan. I liked The Force Awakens, as it did a good enough job of establishing new characters and restarting a worthy new trilogy post-Lucas, but it ultimately felt a bit like fan fiction. The Last Jedi did what it needed to do. It has weight to it. I have small complaints, like I do about all the Star Wars movies, but it is an exciting, fun, and moving experience. Luke's arc was wonderful and has me replaying it repeatedly in my head with butterflies in my stomach. And Snoke, wow. So good. I imagine most people don't care about spoilers by now, but I'll still just leave it all at that, just in case. If you love Star Wars and haven't seen it yet, don't listen to all the negativity. Great, great stuff, and actually built to last. Again, not to rip on TFA too much, but it just isn't really very good for repeated viewings or even that fun to think a lot about afterward--other than wanting to see where it was going to go next. I am very glad that The Last Jedi is where it went."
2052,oz-the-great-and-powerful-movie,AReviews,2,"I was so disappointed, it is a nothing movie, charmless and colorless misadventure and misunderstanding for the world magical movies for ex. Alice in Wonderland wasn't perfect but at least it delivered a good time, unlike this powerless, unfunny movie, don't let any of the visuals trick you or catch your eyes. Here is nothing."
2053,a-prairie-home-companion-movie,[Anonymous],3," Dull, don't want to give away any spoilers, so I'll just say the movie doesn't improve as it goes on. Kevin Kline has some good moments, there's some good comic timing. But the drop dead boring subject matter stays drop dead dull. With the Company, Altman took a subject I have no interest in, ballet, and turned it into a compelling movie. Well here's another subject I have no interest in, quaint midwest radio shows, and the film confirmed my distaste for the subject."
2054,a-serious-man-movie,chw,7,"A Serious Man is quite bizarre, but the Coen brothers still did a good job, and Michael Stuhlberg, Fred Melamed, and Richard Kind acted very very well."
2055,star-trek-movie,A_Northerner,7,"In my opinion, Star Trek was never quite as cool as Star Wars and I remember some of the feature films being particularly poor. J.J Abrams does his best to equal things up by giving the much-loved franchise a much needed modern update with this 2009 reboot. By setting the action in the infancy of the Enterprise (a prequel to the original TV series), the writers are not only able to base the story around familiar characters but younger, more energetic versions of those seen before. No doubt slightly unpopular with Star Trek die-hards, this results in a film that will attract younger viewers to the franchise. This is summed up by the scene where Kirk is shown in bed with a scantily clad busty green alien at the academy, a scene unlikely to have appeared in any previous Star Trek film. However, Abrams gives enough props to the franchise with some finer details like the transporting CGI and sound effects and Spock using a Vulcan death grip without giving in to the clichéd catchphrases that I had expected. The film itself is a fast paced action-er with an enjoyable plot, and would be capable of being a decent space action film without all that being a Star Trek film brings to it. Chris Pine's Kirk is  but likeable and his rivalry with the young Spock is a source of some of the films funnier moments. I loved Zachary Quinto in Heroes and he is superbly cast as the legendary Spock, who finds himself confused between his Vulcan upbringing and human emotions. It was great to see Leonard Nimoy make more than a cameo appearance as the older Spock, but as often the case with action film villains, it was shame that Eric Bana wasn't really given much to work as Nero."
2056,harry-brown-movie,rustyjudas,7,"Harry Brown is a sick film innit? Michael Caine plays the titular character Harry Brown a disgruntled O.A.P. widower who after hearing the news of his friends death at the hands of local thugs takes matters into his own hands. The back story informs the audience that Harry was in the marines and stationed in Northern Ireland during the troubles. This handles the notion that Harry Brown can be adept w/ a weapon and be able to kill. He lives alone and keeps a picture of his wife and deceased child by his bedside and his loneliness and isolation is represented by his hand on the pillow where his wife would lay if she was alive. In fact Harry misses the last minutes of his wife's life as he had to circumvent the subway en route to the hospital due to the presence of local thugs. To make matters worse these local thugs are also harassing his best friend who he plays chess w/ in the local dingy pub. Ultimately this will result in his friends death and result in Harry's switch to vigilantism. The film is directed by newcomer Daniel Barber who had previously directed some award winning short. The film has a gritty realism which includes hand-held shots. Some of the exterior shots are lovely evoking the feel of Loach, Leigh etc However the interior shots are a lot more clichéd and shot in desaturated colours of brown and green etc they work well in the normal environments but the drug den for instance is overkill on the cliché. Ultimately the style is to look as grimy and mundane and atypical of an urban lifestyle. Michael Caine gives the lead character gravitas and a world weariness which makes his descent into brutal revenge that little bit more convincing despite some of the ludicrous set pieces. The film is excessively violent and might actually deter the audience it is aimed at which is the type of person who reads The Daily Mail and exclaims how the world has gone to pot and how something must be done but not doing anything themselves. In that respect it has become a wish-fulfilment movie and exploitation movie for the kitchen table newspaper reader. No problems with that but there have been recent movies such as Gran Torino and Dead Man's Shoes which deal w/ the idea of vigilantism, turf war and the nature of revenge in a more stylish and thoughtful manner. This is more like Death Wish in its approach. The fact that Harry brown isn't made accountable for his actions no matter how justified the audience feels is a tiny bit suspect on the writers approach. Overall an entertaining movie which is well shot if  unoriginal and can often delve into ludicrousness especially in its depiction of violence which almost tapers towards the Tarantinoesque. The film doesn't explain the causes or symptoms of gang infested tenements but it's kind of implied that poverty, drugs (footage of some crack pipe action) and negligent parents (Plan B's mother is ineffective and defensive of her son's actions) are all factors in this cycle of crime. One last thing Plan B is excellent he plays an obnoxious chav w/ relish and his affectionless psychopathy is pretty nauseating. I didn't realise it was him until I saw the end credits."
2057,robocop-movie,MatchesPev,10,"Brilliant. Sums up the 80's action genre in one film. Fantastic plot, amazing soundtrack, great action choreography. And a random, excessive, but exciting level of violence. This film will force you to your couch in an exhilarating turn of events. Then you go to sleep at the end of the film and have one thought. Wow."

2059,the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-movie,gamesreflexoes,10,"Movies are done for FANS not for critics journalists! This is a amzing movie, if you are a Lord Of Rings fan you will fall in love with this one. Peter Jackson is a great director."
2060,pineapple-express-movie,GoodTaste,3," I saw this together with Step Brothers, and I am incredibly disappointed. I find it mind boggling that this is supposed to represent the best, hippest thing that Hollywood has to offer. While Pineapple Express is not as bad as Stepbrothers, it's also not good. At all. These movies are self-indulgent- they offer goofiness in place of wit and substance, and even the goofiness is uninspired. They feel like they were written in a weekend, and the non-comedy is supposed to suffice because it's this specific group of people- wow, did Seth Rogen just make a cameo in Step Brothers???!! It's all my favorite comedy stars at the same time!! Too bad none of them have anything funny to say. It's disrespectful to the audience. James Franco, the one legitimate actor in this movie, also illustrates what real actors do that some comedians- especially the comedians who have mysteriously found themselves in the Apatow pack- cannot: he imbues his character with actual feelings, and becomes the only person on screen worth caring about. I go in wanting to laugh- I root for these movies to be good, and they never, never are."
2061,beasts-of-the-southern-wild-movie,Bestpony,2,"The film transports you to a strange world plagued by some very serious problems: extreme poverty, alcoholism, lack of health care, child abuse... and then seemingly tries to convince you that all of that is ok, because it's HOME, you know? I fully expected that Hushpuppy, that poor, naive little girl, will gradually learn that all the adults around her are irresponsible idiots, but nope - they're the wise ones. This is essentially an escape fantasy for unhappy city-dwellers who dream of a simpler, fuller, more ""real"" life in some magic land where you can be one with nature and realize that every animal has a heartbeat and everything in the universe is connected. The last shot of a tribe of noble savages triumphantly returning to their swamp after escaping the evil clutches of civilization, with its unnatural hygiene and health care, is probably the worst thing I've seen in a film this year."
2062,godzilla-2014-movie,Raanth,10,"Easily one of the best movies of 2014 so far, if not the best. As someone who kind of spoiled himself to all of the trailers (not a smart idea) I felt, at first, feeling a bit empty. Soon after the film, i thought about it, and realized how well put together Godzilla really is: Good human drama (could be better, but FAR from bad), fantastic effects, and a well thought-out story line, in my opinion, gives Godzilla its place in 2014."
2063,inception-movie,KoleK,10," This movie is a masterpiece. Confusing at first, but it turns into a smart idea from beginning to end. And the ending is genious, but not spoiling it."
2064,mother-movie,DarthCritic,1,"Awful, just plain awful.  I could not even finish this movie.  I tried to watch it for three nights in a row and only got through about half of it total.  Don't bother."
2065,let-me-in-movie,JUIKER,9,"The two principals each offer Oscar-worthy performances that the Academy bigotedly ignored because neither of them is a day over 13 years old and the movie is a ""horror"" movie. Too bad, but typical. This is a beautiful character-driven story that excels on many levels."
2066,jack-and-jill-movie,TheLonelyCritic,0,"Well, this is it. Adam Sandler has reached a new low. Again. I don't know how, but his movies just get worse and worse with each one. Maybe it's because Sandler's humour hasn't changed in decades. I cannot stand his performance as Jack or Jill. And considering they're where 95% of the humour comes from, that's a sign that you messed up. I don't have a problem with one person playing two characters as it shows their diversity and acting skill. However, the characters need to look, sound and be different enough. Adam Sandler however, could not change his character personalities if his acting career depended on it, which it does."
2067,say-anything-movie,JuhaH.,10, The best Cameron Crowe movie! And that's saying a lot.
2068,maze-runner-the-death-cure-movie,Criticssuck,10,"Only giving it a 10 to counter the trolls who feel the need to give it a one.Realistically I'd give it a 8.5 as there is brilliant set pieces, an amazing score by John Paesano, some breathtaking visuals that stuck to me even after the movie was over, and the great acting from the whole cast. Everybody puts their all in, even the adult actors."
2069,saving-private-ryan-movie,Android,10," One of Spielberg's greatest movies! The script is amazing and the the acting is great, also one of Tom Hanks' greatest movies. The violence, action and tragedy in the movie really bring out the realism of the war. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone that can handle some graphic, painful, bloody action."
2070,alice-through-the-looking-glass-movie,MissChievous,8,"Another beautiful story of female strength, blended with the worth of family, friendship, and whimsy. Perhaps why male reviewers want to dis poor Alice? My 11 year old son, who didn't want to go, ended up enjoying it and giving it a thumbs up. Admitedly, after reviews, I wasn't expecting much, but throughly enjoyed it. My only criticism would be the 3D effects. Not so great. So save your $ and go for 2D. But the wonderful colors deserve big screen treatment."
2071,red-tails-movie,Pelaro,0,"THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST HISTORICALLY INACCURATE WW2 MOVIE EVER MADE. When the 332 Fighter Group, usually known as the Tuskegee Airmen, started flying bomber escort missions in May of 1944, much of the Luftwaffe's front line combat strength had already been decimated, largely as a result of Operation Pointblank, which reached its peak during Operation Argument, Big Week, February 20-26. This was a focused attempt, largely the brainchild of Jimmy Doolittle, to savage Germany's aircraft industry and decimate its fighter squadrons. It went into full scale during January of 1944, and ended in April, as bomber missions then started a concentrated campaign to cut Germany's supply of oil and to cripple its transportation infrastructure prior to D-Day. The Tuskegee fliers took no part in it. During that period, the Eighth Air Force's top pilots ( based in England , and under Doolittle's command ), Francis Gabreski, Robert Johnson and Don Gentile scored 10, 15 and 19 kills on Luftwaffe fighters, respectively. John Godfrey, Gentile's wingman, shot down 6 ( incidentally, the Gentile/Godfrey team was the most famous fighter pairing of World War 2 ). To make this as clear as possible, between January and April of 1944, these four pilots downed half as many planes as the entire 332nd did IN ITS FULL YEAR OF FLYING ESCORT MISSIONS ! Contrary to the film's adolescent dramatics, fighters were directed to seek out and pursue German fighters BEFORE THEY COULD REACH THE BOMBERS ! Dead Germans could not hurt the bombers, and bomber losses to fighters plummeted throughout 1944 ( however, German flak got much worse, as 88mm guns were pulled from the Russian Front to protect German cities). Likewise, accompanying bombers over target areas made no sense for our fighters, as German fighters usually struck before and after the B17s and B24s hit their industrial targets SO AS NOT TO BE SHOT DOWN BY THEIR OWN FLAK ! Flying over target thus put fighters at unnecessary risk from flak, which they had no power over during escort missions. Regarding the Curtis P 40 ( which is loudly complained about in the movie by 332nd pilots ), British, Australian and South African pilots were very successful against Axis fighters with them in North Africa ( Clive Caldwell , top Aussie Ace, notched 22 kills with the P 40 before being transferred to the Pacific ). At the same time the 332nd was receiving P 51s, The Flying Tigers (14th Air Force ) were still overwhelmingly dependent on P 40s, using them to great effect the spring of 1944 to thwart the Japanese Ichi-Go Offensive in China, not completely converting to P 51 Mustangs until June of 1945. CONCLUSION : The only way to enjoy this movie is by knowing little about WW2, nothing about the air war, less than nothing about the war in the Mediterranean, and much less than nothing about the air war in the MTO. Lukas has colluded to insult every other American fighter group, especially the other six ( 1st, 14th, 82nd---all flying P38s---31st, 52nd, and 325th ---all flying P51s the last year of the war ) that served the Fifteenth Air Force along with the 332nd. Those six groups downed over 1,400 Axis planes, on average each credited with twice as many kills as The Tuskegee guys. GOT THE PICTURE ? Read The Forgotten Fifteenth by Barrett Tillman for more insights !"
2072,the-martian-movie,fantasy,3,"I am a true lover of science fiction movies and was very much looking forward to seeing The Martian.  Little did I realize that the trailer was the movie.  Mars is depicted beautifully.  Matt Damon is cracking jokes throughout his ordeal.  Think back Tom Hanks with his volleyball friend Wilson as that is all he had to keep his sanity while he was stranded.  On the other hand Matt Damon thinks of his situation like a huge video game in that he has to be smarter than the average bear.  At no time does the audience not think that he isn't getting back home.  There is no suspense; no sense of urgency; no sense of danger; and that is what takes the movie down.  If you saw Sandra Bullock in the yawn of a movie Gravity where she talks to herself, the The Martian is the same, but this time with Matt Damon in a comedic role which belies all realty.  By the 2nd hour you;re checking your watch asking when this will end.  I'm sorry but when this hits free TV just like Gravity I would never give it a second look.

2073,legion-movie,WalterS.,3," Poorly plotted, disconnected and vague. I just didn't enjoy this film."
2074,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,lehulk,2,"Not only The Last Jedi is a bad movie and by far the worst Star Wars, but it actually succeeded to make The Force Awakens even worse than I initially thought it was.I tolerated the lack of ambition of episode 7, thinking it was just here to introduce a bunch of new characters and factions, but episode 8 just took a big dump on it, destroying all the potential of this new trilogy.Unlike what I've read, there is nothing bold or brave in this movie, unless you think destroying this saga is a brave thing to do.As most people here, I thought the writing was poor, the humour was stupid (and not in a good way), bad dynamic between the characters, the casino arc was childish, Luke, Snoke, Phasma and even Rey were wasted, etc... And what's up with people breathing in space like Rose's sister ?? No idea were this trainwreck of a trilogy is heading, but I honestly don't care anymore - I'm out.These movies had so much potential because the Star Wars lore is so rich, and yet TLJ felt like any other sci-fi movie addressed to a generation of entitled kids that expect the own the whole world without any training or hard work."
2075,the-forgotten-movie,Alexander_Fred,3,"The Forgotten starts off splendidly leaving questions unanswered so that suspense builds. Then, we discover the source of the missing children and the entire story crumbles. This film had the capacity to be a great mystery and psychological thriller with great themes of love, morality, and family, but ultimately, it becomes inane, far fetched, and a laughable farce."
2076,silent-hill-movie,AnthonyA.,8," Never, ever, ever listen to critics when it comes to film. I can't say that enough. This especially applies to a film based on a videogame such as Silent HIll. Film critics are notorious for hating video games as a form of art/entertainment. Sorry Roger Ebert, but you're old and this is a whole new world. Yours and other critic's opinions on this film is irelevant in my opinion. Now for the movie: If you played the games religiously, as I have, then you will definatly appreciate what has been done in the transition to the big screen. It looks great, it sounds great and 99% of the time it just feels right. People who saw this movie with me who had never played the game left the movie really confused. Aside from the lame dialogue, and liberties taken with the story from the first SIlent Hill, this was my only gripe with the film. It is definatly for the fans of the franchise and everyone else is really left in the dark. That aside, everyone can agree that this movie does magicaly transport you into its foggy, gloomy world. And to be honest with you, I am glad that people who never played the games left the theater a bit confused because figuring out the truth about Silent Hill is what has made the games so great. I'm still trying to figure them all out, as I'm sure some of the hard core fans of the series are as well. As a Silent Hill fan: 9 As a film geek: 8"
2077,kill-list-movie,Andys_Reviews,7,"The film starts with what looks like an average domestic drama with Jay and Shel constantly falling out and making up. But once Jay and Cal set about their work the whole atmosphere of the piece changes. There is a great sense of mystery with several aspects of the plot not fully explained, leaving it to the audience to decide, this I really liked. I should warn potential viewers that there are scenes of very extreme violence and an awful lot of swearing (so be prepared). Over all, I found it a decent watch with some very nice aspects and an ending that"
2078,the-longest-yard-movie,LudovicT.,2," If you're a teenager and love American football and smoke joints: you can give a shot to this movie, since it is well-acted, but buy an illegal DVD instead of giving money to stupid filmmakers. The jokes are not great but the first part, with the car chase, is funny. Then Adam plays the hero, he's ok but not as good as when playing the anti-hero. If you're not a teenager and you have a brain, even high you should AVOID this movie ! After a nice beginning, you will be annoyed by easy jokes until you eventually totally fall asleep in front of a looooong game of American football. Totally dumb, should be a 1 half an hour movie for such emptiness."
2079,manchester-by-the-sea-movie,Acacia,3,"i don't care how great the acting is in this movie, it was not entertaining for me and I found it to be just dark, dreary and depressing.  If I had a dollar for each time we were in a car, the movie would have more than paid for itself.  If you are looking to be entertained, this is not the movie for you.  The story is depressing and Casey Affleck's character is depressed.  There is no humor at all in any scene.  Awful!"
2080,coco-2017-movie,JosueOG2020,10,"A film with a deep message beyond being an animated film. Perfect for not only for children with a great imagination, but for young people and adults with a big heart."
2081,twilight-movie,Comasi,0,"The acting is terrible, the movie's stupid and for me the movie is just targeted for tweens. I'm also tired of this vampire sh. Kristin Stewart barely has any emotions and she was way better in Adventureland. Every vampire aren't really vampire's! What I mean is that the vampires aren't sucking any blood, they sparkle in the sun and I'm glad there's a movie parodying this crap."
2082,fantastic-four-movie,markK,3," This movie arely strings you along with glib lines and has just enough interest to tease you into not walking out of the theatre. You will find soon yourself thinking, ""Why another action book to movie?"", and don't worry, you won't be alone. Just to cap it off this movie has one of the most anticlimatic endings I can remember, and, as result, it's hard to even recommend this as a DVD release."
2083,the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-3d-movie,Iamthejuan,3,"This is probably one of the dumbest, most unbelievable films in the series. There is a scene where leatherface chases one of the main characters and she falls not once, not twice, but three times. Leatherface then chases her over a fence into the middle of a carnival, where he runs past about 50 potential victims, apparently set on killing the unbelievably sexy white girl (leatherface must not have approved of her interracial relationship). The girl then decides to grab onto the bottom of a ferris-wheel carriage, because ferris wheels don't go in a circle in her mind. Low and behold, as she is almost to the bottom a cop shows up with a gun. Leatherface throws his chainsaw like a boomerang at the cop. That was all in the scope of a 2 min scene. This movie is pure silliness. In fact, it is still running in the background as I type this; that's how uninteresting it is. Oh wait, more silliness. Now, after leatherface has killed her boyfriend and 2 friends, this chick all of a sudden decides to save him from a rather fitting and ironic death, and then help him kill the evil hillbilly police that killled his family but somehow let him escape. Like most 3d films, this relies on a name and the fact that people will pay to see the same rehashed crap again."
2084,secretariat-movie,10sne1,7,"Full disclosure: I met Secretariat, standing at stud at Claiborne Farm outside Paris, Kentucky, in 1974. Let me tell you, that Red was one very impressive horse. He bolted across the pasture to where we stood at the rail and tried to bite my wife's, um, well, let's not go into anatomical detail. But alas, Big Red was more impressive than the movie about him. Alas, I couldn't help comparing it (the film) with Seabiscuit (the film), and it doesn't nearly shine like that one did. Also I kept seeing Diane Lane as little Liz Taylor all growed up and dealing with a horse a whole lot more memorable than National Velvet. Plucky owner, plucky horse. Still, the film has its moments. I still remember seeing the Belmont live on TV in '73 and being absolutely blown away by Secretariat's unprecedented performance, so this flick made that experience come alive for me again. Kudos to John Malkovich and Margo Martindale (lately of TV's ""Justified"" fame) for entertaining supporting roles. I don't know how many nags played the role of Secretariat but frankly they just didn't quite do him justice. He was one awesome dude!"
2085,the-lion-king-movie,ChrisM.,10," Perhaps it's because it's an essential part of my childhood, but The Lion King will always be regarded by me as one of the greatest cartoons ever made. Yes, it's an adaptation of Hamlet, but one that communicates with children and adults alike. There is depth to Simba which is unparalleled in many other Disney movies. Perhaps it's nostalgia, but I think kids today cannot comprehend what they're missing. I, for one, miss the anticipation of the yearly 2-D Disney cartoon. I guess I'm still a kid at heart."
2086,the-dark-knight-movie,M,9," Best Superhero movie by far. Amazing work. ""Nonya Business gave it a1: Much worse than the first. Since when did Batman become hated and a villain?"" Talking about not knowing a dmn... Batman has never been loved in comic books. He's even been prosecuted as a vigilante. Search information about Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns""."
2087,superman-returns-movie,JoelW.,9, I think the film was great. More than that. Fantastic. Singer did a wonderful job. I cant wait for the Sequel.
2088,the-shape-of-water-movie,ambermd,10,"An exceptional movie, which at its heart is about form (and how it doesn't really matter) and love. Beautifully directed by del Toro, supported by an incredible score and Octavia Spencer's hilarious supporting role really made this film what it is, which is all topped off by the ambigious ending."
2089,the-twilight-saga-eclipse-movie,MaxxSwan13,0,"It sucks. I hate it. Anyways, me and my friend made a bet. We are going to see Breaking Dawn Part 1 and see how fast it takes me to puke. Who ever loses has to buy the winner a burger from a restaurant. WISH ME LUCK!"
2090,the-american-movie,BradySmith,3,"Do I even have to explain what's wrong with this movie?  It's extremely boring.  I'm not against art-house action movies.  I enjoyed Drive, and loved Hanna, but can the American even be called an action movie?  I'll admit that I stopped watching after a while and didn't finish it, but after nothing happens for more than an hour did I really need to?  This is not a thought provoking or suspenseful film as some have claimed.  It's mega pretentious and miserably boring.  Sure, it's well filmed and has a pretty location, and nothing's wrong with the acting, but something has to happen in order for a movie to be entertaining.  I hate movie's like Revenge of the fallen that bombard you with empty action and have nothing else to offer, but this movie bombards you with empty nothing and has nothing else to offer, which might be even worse."
2091,the-wolverine-movie,TheFullRetard,3,"Awful. Just plain awful. Making a tortured-soul-identity-crisis-movie with Wolverine? Who would ever think that would work?God, that plot reminded me of Max Payne 3, it's roughly the same useless story, where the protagonist, according o his background and personality, shouldn't be giving a damn about all the people who just come out of nowhere, grab him, put him somewhere far away from home, and try to communicate with him, pretending that something very big and meaningful is happening. The truth is, nothing is really happening, at least, nothing that couldn't be explained in a ten-minute sequence rather than a two-hour parade of boredom.Action scenes are dull and unsophisticated, with CGI so badly made that my eyes were starting to hurt. I've never thought that an action scene with someone like Logan could make me fall asleep, but this movie made me change my mind. Great job.All of this was worth seeing only because of the little two-minute sequence after the credits. Now I'm just keeping my fingers crossed for ""The Days Of The Future Past""."
2092,wonder-woman-movie,OLIO,1,"I believe Hollywood is run by women today because there is an avalanche of feminist movies without any subtlety - like Ghostbusters (2016) - which are so bad that they cannot influence grown up people so clearly they are intended to indoctrinate kids.Wonder Woman 2016 has a bad script and bad acting from the main character, they just rushed to make another feminist movie but if you look closer you see they got an actress from Israel (GADOT Gal) to play a character that kills Germans (trying to imply NAZIS). Also let's not forget that Hitler was actually a soldier in the German army in WW1 so you do wonder if this was intentional - as a metaphor - for a jewish person to kill him in WW1 !Ares is killed in the end by this woman &amp; jewish actress - metaphor for Hitler?There are only 3 reasons why anyone would rate this beyond 5: either you are a woman, you are a kid or you are paid. No way any other sane person would rate this more"
2093,little-miss-sunshine-movie,BrianK.,3," Little Miss Sunshine just wasn't funny enough to compensate for its straightforward, predictable plot. The only redeeming quality of this film was that the character development was well done. Basically, I am amazed that this movie got a nomination for best picture."
2094,hall-pass-movie,lancekoz,3,"There seems to be an idea going around that if you have some actors, a production crew, and an idea, you should make a movie and you might make some money when people come to see your ILLUSION of a movie, but the deal is.... you actually have to do some WRITING to make a movie, because movies are stories, not an ad of a movie. The writing here is stupid and thin, every decent situation is held up or foiled before it is developed to any payoff. In-between are some guilty chuckles created with filth or obvious slapstick."
2095,the-chaperone-movie,Vincer,3,"One word could describe this movie: Boring. I tried watching it with my friend and we were making jokes the whole way through about background shots. Triple H is no actor, the kid is no actor, no one here was any good. Word of advice, skip this snooze-fest."
2096,the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-movie,Schizophreniac,7,"You can feel warm hearts with this film. And I found some scenes a little bit tragic. The story was boring sometimes, but If I need to talk about the general story brilliant film, funny and warm."
2097,21-jump-street-movie,JackKelly,9,"From a teen perspective who i'm sure the film is targeted towards i found this film both entertaining and hilarious. I deem it the perfect 'friends night in' film, if your friends, like mine, enjoy a mix of  'laugh out loud' humour and an interesting, at times immature (but still very real) narrative. I don't like seeing that both users and critics have slated this film. This film never claims to try to be a serious film in the slightest so don't take it as one. Whilst the film doesn't offer seriousness, it offers great humour, good story line and good acting. Go watch it."
2098,the-amazing-spider-man-movie,mgyukeri,9,"The Amazing Spiderman is great reboot of the Spider-Man movie franchise originally directed by Sam Rami.  Mark Webb, director of (500) Days of Summer, brings a fresh and exciting take on Spidey's origin story.  Peter Parker, a geeky highschooler (played by the Social Network's Andrew Garfield) who is infatuated with the kind, rebellious Gwen Stacy (Easy A and Zombieland vet Emma Stone).  Along the way, he fights Killer Croc, a monster he inadvertently creates, and becomes the masked hero we all love.  The acting is great, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have amazing chemistry, and a talented cast including Martin Sheen and Dennis Leary help The Amazing Spider Man really stand out.  Mark Webb is incredibly talented as the director, who once again really captures the emotions of these characters and makes the audience care for them.  The Amazing Spider-Man may have small pacing issues, but it is a great superhero flick nonetheless, and I hope no one will hate me for saying it, makes for a more enjoyable experience than The Avengers."
2099,untitled-star-trek-sequel-movie,Compi24,9,"Once again, J.J. Abrams delivers an utterly magnificent maelstrom of awesomeness. ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" is a brilliantly paced, written, staged, acted, and  obviously  directed piece of art."
2100,the-foreigner-movie,moviecritic68,8,A real action movie which delivers to go along with a reasonable story line.  Probably would have rated this a tad higher but some escape scenes were a bit too far-fetched. Passed the grade of keeping the audience captivated .... even as this film has been out for awhile
2101,underworld-blood-wars-movie,Cheetahice,3,"Underworld: Blood Wars was a film that I was excited for but that excitement was wasted when I saw it. Of course, no film is terrible the only thing great about it is that it had lots of action in the film for my taste. You will only like the film if you are a big fan of the movie film franchise."
2102,inside-llewyn-davis-movie,MooviesNGames,0,"One of the most overrated garbage films I've ever seen.  Incredibly boring, depressing, unfunny and pretentious.  I'm a big Coen Bros fan but this totally missed the mark with me.  Incredibly overrated."
2103,transformers-movie,MarcH,7," Awesome action but...horrible script. A number of scenes could have be cut completely...and some scenes cut in half...seemed like they were not sure how to end it. during the action scenes I kept waiting for them to pull out on the action...too much going on, to close, to fast you can't tell who is who or what is happening. Megan Fox was in the movie purely to look hot...thats it...no point to her character...didn't help the plot or move it along. all in all still a fun movie to watch just had so much more potential."
2104,pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides-movie,Thefilmnerd,3,"This was a big disapointment. I wasen´t looking much for to at all since none of the previous cast was back from the first three movies (besides Johnny Depp). The movie was a complete disaster. The story was pointless, and it did not make any sense to make, because it has nothing to do with the previous movies. Captain Jack Sparrow, you went on the wrong ship."
2105,harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets-movie,Necromus,2,"I saw this at a friend's house along with the first Harry Potter movie after it was released on video. This movie just bored me to death. I don't see what all the hype is about. Maybe you had to read the book, my friends who have read the book tell me that the book is way better than the movie. Rating it as a bad movie since it was so boring that I don't even remember any of it. After seeing the first two movies, I never bothered seeing any others since I was so bored by the first two."
2106,oceans-eleven-movie,TonyB.,3," Not even as good as the original, and that wasn't very good to begin with, ""Ocean'se 11"" is a star-studded piece of tripe of questionable morality and ethics. The sequel is likely to be worse."
2107,the-expendables-3-movie,Thenewone,10,"Totally Underrated, even for fans of franchise, in the first time that i watched The Expendables 3, i found some parts boring but after that i watched the second time these parts is fundamental for the movie storie and isn't boring the such part is what Barney Ross is looking for and recruiting for a new team,and the new add Banderas,Snipes,Ford are all amazing in their characters and the Best Villain of Franchise,Ladies &amp; Gentleman,.... Mel Gibson he's is brilliant amazing, and the movie amazing too UNDERRATED."
2108,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Glakill,2,This film is the worst Star Wars ever made. It deserves some credit for some of the action scenes. Apart from that there is nothing left of good. The story is completely flawed and characters are utterly underdeveloped. I regret having watched it.
2109,the-fountain-movie,PunkR.,3, I went for the visuals and I was not impressed. The story line is thin and the dialog sappy. Everyone here giving the film a 10 must have seen a different movie or they are PR plants. Honestly not worth seeing.
2110,terminator-2-judgment-day-movie,MovieManiac83,9,"When James Cameron crafted The Terminator in 1984, the concept of a sequel was far from his thoughts. The film's box office performance, while more than justifying the movie's understated $6.5 million budget, did not result in studio executives rushing to Cameron to make a follow-up. However, The Terminator arrived on tape just as the mid-'80s home video revolution was gathering steam, and it became one of a few titles whose VHS success oustripped its theatrical performance. By the late 1980s, there was no question that Cameron would make a Terminator sequel. The only mystery was how spectacular it would be. Aliens, Cameron's first big-budget directorial assignment, had been an edge-of-the-seat ride and indications were that he had every intention of topping it with Terminator 2. (In between Aliens and T2, Cameron made The Abyss, a film plagued by production issues that received a lukewarm initial reception but was re-evaluated once a more complete version of the director's vision was released for home viewing.) For T2, Cameron's planed ""major twist"" was unveiled before the movie's release because of marketing considerations. This time, Arnold Schwarzenegger would portray a good Terminator instead of a bad one. Had this been kept a secret, it would have packed a wallop. Unfortunately, the trailers let the cat out of the bag and few (if any) members of the audience were unaware of this switch-up. Knowing the twist beforehand neither ruins the overall movie-going experience nor damages its integrity, but it's not unlike being aware of the identity of Luke's father while watching The Empire Strikes Back. T2 features bigger, bolder, more energetic action sequences than its predecessor (Cameron had a budget of more than ten times that of the original for the sequel). The big moments include a chase scene in which the T-1000, in a truck, pursues John Connor and his Terminator on a motorcycle; the prison break of Sarah Connor; and the explosive finale at Cyberdyne. The film is long enough to allow for more character development than in the original. We come to understand how her obsession with the future has transformed Sarah into a driven woman. A touching friendship develops between John and The Terminator, lending aspects of an off beat ""buddy movie"" to T2. And Miles Dyson (Joe Morton), the scientist/engineer unlocking the secrets of the 1984 Terminator's chip, must face the moral and ethical implications of what he is inadvertently doing. By trying to help mankind, is he instead becoming the author of its genocide? The time paradoxes addressed in this film are more complex than those in The Terminator. This storyline postulates that actions from the future have formed a cornerstone of the past, raising questions about the non-linear nature of time. Cameron's original ending for T2 would have made future sequels unlikely; producer Mario Kassar forced Cameron to abandon his planned ""coda"" to allow for the possibility of additional Terminator movies. Thus far, there have been two (plus a television series), but Cameron has not been involved, claiming the story he wanted to tell concluded at the end of T2. There's a little more humor in T2 than there was in The Terminator. Most of it results from the interaction between John and the Terminator, where the human child attempts to teach the robot killer the intricacies of offhand social interaction. This includes slang expressions such as ""Hasta la vista, baby."" It's also worth noting that, although it would be a stretch to call Schwarzenegger's Terminator ""kinder and gentler"" in this film, he does not kill anyone. Even before John explicitly orders him not to commit murder, the Terminator's visit to the past lacks a body count. (The same cannot be said of the T-1000.) Of course, injury, intimidation, property damage, and general mayhem are exempted. Combined, the first two Terminator movies offer some of the best contemporary-based science fiction action ever provided in a motion picture series. Although the third Terminator movie continues the legacy of impressive, big budget action, the screenplay is lacking in both depth and substance and it feels inferior, especially when viewed back-to-back with Cameron's efforts. Although The Terminator is arguably the more visionary of the first two films, T2 is the more visually and viscerally satisfying. It's an exhausting experience and, even 18 years after its release (as I write this review), few films have matched it within the science fiction genre for sheer white-knuckle exhilaration."
2111,harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-movie,TedH,10," The perfect holiday movie. The film is jampacked with everything that countless other comedies, dramas, and adventure pictures wish they could become. If you have the chance, see it with friends on an IMAX screen, which brings the scope of the presentation to a level not seen this year!"
2112,the-place-beyond-the-pines-movie,5hassay,7,"I recommend watching it. The actors really seemed to put a good effort in their rules, which worked out well. The plot was maybe a bit too simple or something, I am not really sure. I wouldn't consider it a favourite, and I didn't feel super inspired after watching it like one might after watching a film which affected them well. But I liked it, and I am glad I watched it. I would watch it again."
2113,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,hyuntaekim,0,I really should not have come out of this.Why would you do this?It is a movie that should not have really come out of a complete betrayal of Star Wars fans.The film director does not know what message he wants to convey
2114,get-out-movie,GinaK,8,"I enjoyed this film, although it was more mystery than horror film. The production design and the acting were excellent, and not dark and stale like some horror films are. My one problem was that the film needed some trimming and went on about 15 minutes too long."
2115,the-hottie-the-nottie-movie,SusanT.,10," I don't understand all the bad reviews. Yes it's a gross-out movie, but it's a damn funny one! Paris is cute in it."
2116,scary-movie-5-movie,M0vieAddict,1,I enjoyed seeing Charlie Sheen and Snoop Lion on screen but Scary Movie 5 is pretty awful. I'm ashamed to have laughed at the worst jokes because of how bad they really were. It's like having your favourite movies of the past few years ruined. Watching people get smacked on the head is funny the first few times but drilling it into the movie was a huge mistake. You expected it to be horrible and it was. Here's waiting on the next 5 scary movie entrances that are sure to come.
2117,inside-llewyn-davis-movie,imthenoob,8,"Hats off to the talented cast who have given us on the best movie sound tracks in a very long time. As always, Oscar Isaac kills it as the lead and his supporting cast does a great job too. All in all, It's a very interesting movie and very satisfying plot wise. Definitely one I'd highly recommend and one of the best Coens have given us and that's saying something."
2118,untitled-rise-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-sequel-movie,Gamer84,3,"Where should I begin.This movie was atrocious. Writing to me is key to a movie. It goes beyond special effects and which actors are in a movie.  You had 3 writers for this movie and the best thing they could do is do a James Cameron, "" Avatar"" movie. That's all it was with the apes as the Navi. Also some scenes look so identical to Avatar and Lord of the Rings. As for the way they portrayed the apes well I didn't believe them. These people should have watched some nature programs on how apes act towards each other, when they see humans, and what they eat. Everything was so unrealistic especially since they had 10 years to forget about humans. They learned how to write English, speak English and sign language. Really? I can keep going. I think peoples expectations were too high to really say anything bad about this movie since there has not been anything worth watching all year. I think all the CG this summer rotted there brains to actually make any sense on the story. I will say this though, I think 12 monkeys with Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt serves as a better sequel than this."
2119,green-lantern-movie,egg,1,"Although  people have been heavily criticizing this film for its lack of quality and it seeming rushed, both of which I agree with, they had something in there which could have developed into a much better movie. It was entertaining, on the whole, and I found it managed to keep me interested for a long time. I'd like to think myself as a DC geek, and I found myself impressed at how well they'd managed to keep to the original stories.I think the critics are complaining primarily because it couldn't get anywhere close to the Dark Knight, which is a very hard act to follow for DC. Anyone remember Batman Begins? It was good, but nothing special, however it led on to one of the greatest films ever made, in most people's opinion. I think that if Warner Bros. wade through all of the bad reception and decide that they will continue on this, they will be able to produce a far better movie for the sequel. Ignore the critics. Rent it if you can and see what you think."
2120,toy-story-3-movie,Mariofan,2,"This film is mediocre at best. It wasn't good at all. I really liked the first 2 Toy Stories but this was a big disappointment. The voice acting was fine, but it was too scary for it's age group. If you loved the first 2, then give it a shot, but you probably won't enjoy it that much. Otherwise, skip it. Also it's HIGHLY overrated."
2121,queen-of-the-damned-movie,HarleyD,2," If you've read the book, which judging from your comments i'm assuming most of you haven't, you'll understand why this movie was an utter disgrace, not only to the Vampire Chronicles, but to vampire movies in general. Especially considering they completely cut Maharet's sister from the movie when she had the key role in the end. The writers completely messed up the story, and strayed from the book itself. Sure there may have been parts in the movie that were similar to the book, but in the long run, it was pathetic. and not to mention the characters in the end that ended up killing Akasha were strangers to the movie and made no sense what so ever. leaving out so much of what i feel the need to say, this movie was CRAP."
2122,quantum-of-solace-movie,NS.,10, AWESOME AWESOME AND MORE AWESOME! Definitely check this movie out! That action scenes are wicked!
2123,the-revenant-2015-movie,ih8sharts,9,"It is very seldom that a movie impresses me and has me asking ""How did they shoot this scene?"" Sr. Iñárritu uses an outstanding scenic background to tell a compelling story of a man's perseverance, when all he has left is his thirst for revenge.A big thumbs up to Mr. DiCaprio as well for a job well done.I take one point for time-line issues."

2127,baywatch-movie,AndrewBurge,3,"From the beginning, Seth Gordon's 'Baywatch' is a difficult film to watch, but not for the reasons you might think. It involves dozens of unnecessary cuts, its soundtrack changes from one mediocre frat boys party anthem to another, and I am not even going to mention the continuity issues which, of course, are a sin which permeate most films, even great ones. But here they are too many and too obvious.There definitely is a deep message about teamwork, dedication and overall life lessons in this film, but unfortunately is hidden deep under its poor execution. To be more specific, the biggest issue here is the characters, which are written with cliche personalities like your devoted lifeguard Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson), hot-shot Olympic pretty-boy Matt Brody (Zac Efron), nerdy tech savvy awkward teenager Ronnie Greenbaum (Jon Bass) and your pretty girls Stephanie, CJ and Summer (Ilfenesh Hadera, Kelly Rohrbach and Alexandra Daddario). But it does not stop here. It feels as if the film misses the way it wants you to report to each characters. While Brody is supposed to be the black sheep of the group, he often seems as a voice of reason, being the only one mentioning calling the police when Baywatch's own Scooby-Doo gang wants to save an again clichee white collar criminal plot led by an again clichee seductive and dangerous corporate woman, Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra). Also, you cannot help but feel that Mitch's ridiculous ambitious dedication and his machismo bravado make him feel like a psychologically scarred vigilante going beyond his reach to protect the beach, kinda like a Batman only... without the cool gadgets and brooding personality. Not to even mention the montage scene in which, after he gets fired, works at an electronics store. It is cringe worthy and laughable... just like his too numerous heroic acts of life-saving which get tiring quickly.There is a good part though, which this film nails really well. That is the references to the original Baywatch series. It seems that Gordon understands that the heart and soul of these references are more important than their number. There are like-able cameos by David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson and nice parodies to the infamous slow motion scenes. Unfortunately there are also many jokes which are simply misses due to poor execution and worse, they are often prolonged, like when Ronnie stuck his genitals between two wooden planks of a sunbed and also the overall lame writing of Leeds' only two mobsters. Seriously, you thought she would have like a whole mob.Overall, 'Baywatch' does not make an effort into complicating itself. Yet it also fails in coordinating its simple plot to the point in which discontinuity becomes part of the plot continuity! Like the scene in which Brody is held hostage by Leeds but he escapes through 'clever' editing and a firework display caused by Ronnie when he saw a 'big red button' as he immediately proceeded to... flip the switch right next to it. I really wanted to like this film. I could get over the cliche characters and linear plot, but not over the inability to manage its simplicity."
2128,oceans-eleven-movie,andreamonetlump,7,The plot confuses me.  I watched it 3 times.  I like the scenery.  And I wish I had bags of money.  Maybe I will watch it again.  I need to watch movies to stay distracted.
2129,this-is-where-i-leave-you-movie,Shiftyeyeddog,2,"Talented cast is wasted, the script is terrible. Alternately predictable and embarrassing. It's about a dysfunctional family, so embarrassing is par for the course, but to be embarrassing but not actually funny is unforgivable."
2130,man-of-steel-movie,nickclarivette,1,"I was really disappointed in Man of Steel. Henry Cavil makes a great looking Superman yes, but that's where the enjoyment ended for me. Zach Snyder's tone is just too serious for what should be the ultimate comic book movie feast experience. The movie feels self-indulgent and overblown, and not in a good way. I was missing the fun to balance out the heavy gloom of the the movie. But I'm not too surprised after seeing what Snyder did with, or is that to Watchmen. Lately the best examples of superhero movies have been X-men and The Avengers. What a pity Man of Steel doesn't deliver on that kind of fun."
2131,10-cloverfield-lane-movie,Aldemir_L,3,"Don't believe the hype!. A terrible blend of  ""Alien"" (the film) with ""Fallout"" (the PC game). Starts from a good premise and good cast and acting, but then nothing more. By the middle of the movie the screenplay turns into a hilarious cliché."

2133,eragon-movie,jfrotylpe532,0,"Oh dear lord where to begin. You know you've seen a piece of crap when you watch this film. To make a film out of an adult setting book with darkness everywhere and instead make cheesy and boring lines everwhere dissapoints me. The events were poorly plotted, not to mention the terrible Saphira and Eragon. In the future, if your gonna make a book into a movie make sure you read it first"
2134,hitchcocktruffaut-movie,DanBurrito,8,"Hitchcock/Truffaut tells a fascinating true story with all the respect and detail that it deserves. It gives us a look at both filmmakers' lives and careers with an insightful and interesting analasys of their storytelling techniques and visual craft. It was always interesting to see various well-known filmmakers giving their own opinions on these two director's work and the influence they had on modern cinema. Overall, Hitchcock/Truffaut is a well-made and intriguing documentary, recommended for fans of its subjects and movie lovers in general alike."
2135,avatar-movie,DaltonO,3," Eh, yeah its all 3D, yeah its got allot of special effects and costs allot, yeah its got blue alien boobs, but other than that there is nothing here. Terrible cliche, hole-filled plot leaves you bored. Its kind of amazing how you can have such a crappy plot and waste 4 hours on it. After you watch it you think its good at first, but that is just an effect from the CGI and 3D. Soon you will realize how lame it is. ""the Eywa sees you!"" ugg soooo cheesy."
2136,rent-movie,JustinC.,7," Film critics were harsh on this film adaptation, and though it doesn't execute the same as watching the stage production...it's really not that fallible against it. So why did musical critics rave about Rent, not to mention giving it a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony, and film critics detest the story on film."
2137,sucker-punch-movie,MadMonk,0,"how could a movie which trailer promised to have 5 scantily-clad females kicked ass with guns and swords be so boring and unbearably tiresome? five ways: shoddy story, childish dialogues, use familiar covered songs to tell the story, use plenty of slo-mo, rehash action sequences from other better movies. the video game probably rocks more than the movie."

2139,there-will-be-blood-movie,Prowler477,0,"Absolutely awful movie! I saw this movie because there was nothing else on and to say I didn't like it is an understatement. Truthfully the entire movie is uninteresting, boring and supremely stupid."
2140,bridesmaids-movie,markb1166,2,Now I did enjoy this as I was dragged to the cinema with girlfriend but only compared to other films like this. Very unimagintive story wise in my eyes as it was so predictable. The larger of the bridesmaids was funny but the lead charecter the bride and the annoying I'm perfect girl was just too much and teh cop was just rubbish. Funny in parts but in general poor.
2141,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,americanpatriot,3,"- The Last Jedi is Rian Johnson losing a Senate seat in Alabama. Riding llamas through Las Vegas???- Why is there a Hunger Games/Fantastic Beasts subplot AT ALL?? Does NOTHING for the story—the codebreaking sequence is literally totally ditched. Wasted, BORING 30 min. In the middle of a Star Wars movie.- Rose is a terrible, useless, annoying character.- Why do Finn and Rose go all the way across the galaxy for THE MASTER CODEBREAKER and then randomly get put in a cell with a perfectly good codebreaker who just happens to be waiting to escape when they need him? - Halfway through the movie I actually thought “I wonder if I’m going to watch this again.” I should never think that in a Star Wars film. I still can’t believe it crossed my mind. I LOVE Star Wars. I saw the Phantom Menace and the Force Awakens four times each in theaters. I am NOT a hard Star Wars critic.- SO. MANY. BAD. JOKES.- Bill Weasley is so freaking annoying.- We both know the two characters with fake-out death scenes should have died or not had those fake-out death scenes.- NO backstory on Snoke???? NOTHING on Rey’s parents?? These were major questions from TFA! Rey’s lineage was a MAJOR theme in TFA. No continuity with Abrams. Hopefully J.J. saves these in Episode IX.- Also, I initially thought The Last Jedi was original. Upon further reflection, I’ve realized that he freaking copied and pasted almost every major plot point from Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. No idea what they’re going to do in Episode IX because The Force Awakens already stole everything from A New Hope."
2142,upintheair-movie,MatthewM.,10," In my opinion the best movie of the year, with Hurt Locker a very close second. I am not a huge fan of Reitman, but the writing, directing, and acting in this is incredible, not to mention the subtext of our culture, who we've become as people, and what we're doing to our uncles, aunts, fathers, and grandfathers. This film has humor, pain, joy, sadness, and moments of belief in love followed by deep existential loneliness. Amazing work, gonna see it again very soon."
2143,lucy-movie,RL_Stine,3,"I went into this movie with pretty low expectations. Because of this, I was quite surprised by the first twenty minutes. The directing was great and the story was very intense and interesting. Unfortunately, once the movie got to the whole ""brain expansion"" thing it quickly become silly, cliched, and tiresome.The movie makes several bad attempts at humanizing the main character while simultaneously showing her commit horrible acts of violence. Because of this, it is hard to ever feel any real emotions for the main character and the movie never really spends much time trying to make you feel for any other characters. Near the end, the movie turns into a CGI mess and ends with a predictable whimper. It's not the worst movie to come out this year, but it probably isn't worth your time."
2144,the-dark-knight-movie,MichelleC.,10," This movie was amazing! Heath's Joker blasts Jack's out of the water! Just enough of a pyschotic to make things interesting but not enough to totally creep me out. I can't think of a negative for this movie honestly. I didn't even mind that it was 2 hours and 40 minutes long, in fact I was so into the movie the time flew by! Havey's facial injury looked amazing...as well."
2145,predator-movie,JaredC.,10, Its pretty sweet throughout.
2146,star-wars-episode-vii---the-force-awakens-movie,nj06,3,"As someone who saw all the previous Star War movies, and enjoyed each one of them, my impression of Force Awakens is mostly negative.  This is by far the least original movie in the Star Wars series.  There are zero surprises or suspense in The Force Awakens.  Every plot twist (if it can be even called that) is telegraphed with an unusual lack of subtlety.  You can say what you want about Lucas, but even the harshest critic of prequels has to acknowledge that every one of those movies, while perhaps containing some wooden acting and a few unfortunate characters (e.g. Jar Jar) also introduced new awesome goose-bump-producing characters (e.g. Qui Gon, Darth Maul), new plot twists, and genuine surprises.  The Force Awakens simply has none of that.  Instead it has the feeling of a made-for-TV Star Wars reunion special.  A big problem for The Force Awakens are its villains.  Kylo-Ren could not scare a 5-year old, the store-brand Voldemort (pardon me Supreme Leader Snoke) reminded me mostly of an elderly Ent,  General Hux is is a drama queen in a 1950's flight-attendant hat, and Captain Phasma mostly has the role of an obedient and disciplined hostage.  Darth Vader would  each on one of those with his little finger while drinking his morning tea gazing in the distance.  If you are looking for something scary in this movie, Carrie Fisher's acting is it.  Anticipating whether she will be able to keep it together in her scenes provides some nervous suspense.  The battle scenes are surprisingly short and taking place mostly on earth as far as I can tell.  Space is simply not a big part of this movie.   I could go on and, on but you get the gist.  I watched each on the previous Star Wars movies at least 10 times and they remain one of my guilty-pleasures and time-wasters.  I will continue to watch the newly made Star Wars movies, but probably each one of them just once."
2147,the-producers-movie,treedw.,10, What a spectacular movie! greatly funny and wildly entertaining.
2148,bad-santa-movie,RobB.,10, This movie is f..kin hilarious! Definitely on my top 10 list of all time! Not one minute without a profanity. There's gonna be a lot of pissed parents that brought little Johnny thinking it was the perfect family movie.
2149,madagascar-3-europes-most-wanted-movie,Tranquilbez22,9,"Can't believe I enjoyed this movie. the traillers didn't look promising. Best Madagascar than the first two combined. Well casted, great plot and humour is hilarious without having to reference pop-culture (Dreamworks are learning from their mistakes judging by their last three films before this). The Animation is stunning. Once again Sacha Baron Cohen steals the show as King Julian, That man can do no wrong. If you felt burned by what Pixar and Blue Sky had to offer this year. Then I suggest you watch this."
2150,pride-2014-movie,randwilliam,10,"Went into this expecting a niche gay movie. But it is so much more fun! The Brits do have a way with low budget, big payoff films. Of course, it is not for those who don't think gays are human."
2151,resident-evil-afterlife-movie,worleyjamers,3,"Haven't seen the others in the saga, but this wasn't that good. There were some elements that I enjoyed, but i'll be able to tell more when I see the series in order. Milla Jovovich is not a good actress though."
2152,pans-labyrinth-movie,[Anonymous],10, A graceful and amazing film of historic proportions.
2153,a-scanner-darkly-movie,JustinB.,9," Dude... this movie is a trip. You have to meta-meta-think about it to get it. Not only do you have to watch the movie, you have to watch yourself watching the movie, and then analyze that. When you leave, you'll feel like you're on drugs. And then you'll be paranoid as hell. I'd call this more of an experience than a movie. Go see it in theaters."
2154,the-imitation-game-movie,adbhaskar,10,"the Imitation Game is quite possibly the finest movie of the year. Pure brilliance to all involved--superbly acted, exceptional direction, and a screenwriting debut from Graham Moore showing prowess in writing well beyond his years. We find ourselves wondering: how is Alan Turing not a household name? Perhaps now, he finally will be."
2155,cloverfield-movie,R.Smith,7," I thought the movie was very well done. It had stunning visuals and compelling character portrayal. The vantage point of the characters was fun to be in, and made you feel as if you were really with them. I thought the army scenes were amazing, and the acting was surprisingly realistic and natural. I however did not like the bouncing motion of the camera...it made me queasy and gave me a headache. This would be an easy 9 or 10 if the ending hadn't of left you wondering why you went to see the show in the first place. I think Hollywood tries to be too artistic sometimes...just give us what we want...a real ending."
2156,skyline-movie,grandpajoe6191,2,"The worst movie of the year. I have nothing positive to comment on this movie except for the CGI. the cast is horrible with stone cold acting, running around the penthouse for an hour devoured by aliens. The story is uninspired with a preposterous ending. This is a movie that has lost its way to the direct-to-home video pile."
2157,star-wars-episode-viii---the-last-jedi-movie,Swingtrade,1,"My intellect felt molested. Unfortunately, it cannot be unseen. This movie is the perfect analogy of Gold wrapped   I left the theater confused and almost felt guilty for not liking it. It took me a day to process, weighing the facts, trying to make sense of this experience.  I am an easy going type of guy, I can appreciate the simple things, I don't care if it's from Disney, who's the producer, I sure expected this movie to be on part with the Franchise but trust me it's not. At this point I don't understand the critics, it's all very fishy, to say the least.  Anyways, it's so bad I cannot imagine how on earth they were not aware it would not receive this kind of review from the public. Even Mark Hamil thought so.  So what is the point, is Disney that retarded? Are we?  And what is next?  Can we please have JJ Abram back or Christopher Nolan.  I am going to give this movie 1/10 point for Luke drinking unpasteurized green space cow milk, jeez it was awful."

2159,sin-city-a-dame-to-kill-for-movie,seventhseal,3,"Stunningly good to look at, maybe best watched with the sound off then. As for the plot/story of the movie was utter drivel and left me angry at the wasted talent who had enrolled to this follow up to the great Sin City movie. Very, very poor overall and unfortunately not a title I would like to recommend."
2160,noah-movie,BB_Critic,2,"Noah is one of the worst pieces of crap of 2014. The movie doesn't follow the story correctly and half the events in the movie don't make sense. At least the CGI and acting are decent. But by god what an overrated movie. I would recommend this only to hardcore Darren Aronofsky fans, but no one else. 2/10"
2161,gunner-palace-movie,MarcR.,8," It's not a bad movie, but they could have done more with it. I suppose with all the embedded coverage of the war, and after the ABC reality series which they pulled off the air after like 3 episodes, this sucker wasn't all that original. However, that being said, it was refreshing to get to know at least a handful of American soldiers. Sure, they rapped, blew off some steam, and had some fun, but I was proud that this film confirmed for everyone that these men and women are solid folks, good people who are put into and extremely difficult situation and making the best of it. If you're hesitating seeing this film because you think it's going to be political - don't. It's not overtly pro war or anti-war. Probably the most interesting segment was an interview with one of the soldiers who described in detail how they don't fear bullets, mortars, RPGs or anything else conventional -- fear stems solely from the IEDs which are hidden in garbage, and ""this whole country is covered in garbage."" I guess I had assumed that it wouldn't be overly difficult to spot suspicious looking boxes, etc. in the street, but that segment drove home just how precarious any drive becomes. [They should put the hardened prisoners on ""Street Sweeping Duty.""] The film also brilliantly showed the heroism of the Iraqi informants like ""Ray"" and ""SuperCop"" who risk their lives daily by assisting the Army with intelligence about insurgents and terrorists. SuperCop explains that the insurgents have never known a world free of war and they are afraid to live in such a world -- it's merely a fear of the unknown. The Iraqis who assist the coaltion can envision an Iraq that is free of fear and terror - a place where they can hang out with their friends and family, where they can laugh and be together without that collective pit in their stomachs. Once this way of thinking is spread to the Iraqis at large, we'll be able to leave them, knowing their country is in good hands."
2162,green-zone-movie,cameronmorewood,9,"Not a war movie, no. But an elegant, perfectly paced thriller? Yes. Paul Greengrass has accomplished something here that he couldn't with the Bourne films, because the audience can believe everything he's telling them."
2163,contraband-movie,HomeReviewer,7,"What Wahlberg had going in the 2007 movie Shooter, he has going for him here. You may have a vague and general idea of where the movie might be going but you don't have time to really predict what comes next after most every scene. The story is not complicated, just fast paced and loaded with material, like Shooter, and the twists that punctuate the whole story are unpredictable just as in Shooter. The official movie outline gives you a fair idea of the type of movie it is. Very good cast. Giovanni Ribisi plays the bad guy very well; I say this because if you despise the character, as you most certainly will, then he's done his job well. He has. Then you have J.K. Simmons, who has never failed to deliver a good performance in any of the numerous movies I've seen him in, still keeping that record intact. He plays Captain Camp, a crusty and tough cargo ship captain who has every reason to suspect the notorious smuggler Chris Faraday, played by Mark Wahlberg; what you don't expect is what he does about it and how Faraday turns the table on him. That was good writing on the part of either Aaron Guzikowski or the writers of the original 2008 Icelandic/German/Dutch production ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam""; I can't tell who came up with it. Ben Foster has in my opinion the most difficult part to play as Sebastian. I don't want to spoil things by saying more other than he delivers a good performance, not unlike a character he has often played. Kate Bekinsale plays the wife of Wahlberg, a recalcitrant victim if ever there was one (perhaps Jennifer Lopez in 2002 ""Enough"" was a tougher one) and she complements Walberg's role quite well. The actors I mentioned and a few more were all quite busy as this movie has lots of action meat. I don't think you'll be disappointed with the movie, and I recommend it to my friends."
2164,cafe-society-movie,2morovian,3,"If Bobbie's character was supposed to be a direct impersonation of Woody Allen, then his casting and performance were spot on, right down to an utter absence of sexual charisma and the whiny neuroses we've all come to hate after being hammered with it, over and over again, in most of Allen's films. If this wasn't enough to destroy any chance of this film being even mildly entertaining, then Allen's narration buried it in concrete as permanently as Ben's victims.This was a total indulgence piece with yet another reworking of the now patent New York vs. L.A. dilemma. Since Allen is clearly trying to hold on to something he has only actually possessed sporadically in his entire career, and has now taken to churning out one mediocre film after another, he's a great candidate for forced retirement. Give us a break, Woody, and at least allow us to remember your works of genius with appreciation instead of regret."
2165,just-go-with-it-movie,marcomom,7,"For those that say no guy would choose Jennifer Aniston over Brooklyn Decker, as we walked out of the movie, my husband (who is a very normal 30 something man) turned to me and said ""That is a no-brainer . . . Jennifer Aniston WITHOUT A DOUBT!"".  Jennifer is awesome - I love her and enjoyed the movie.  It was not a great movie by any means, but it was really funny and we did not regret spending the money or time on it.  I am tired of the far-fetched movies that don't make sense, but at least this one KEPT ME LAUGHING!!"
2166,the-lobster-movie,Mikl,0,"One of the worst movies I've seen in this century. They took a great premise and drove it into the ground with crappy acting (although the script ensured that) and an intrusively bad score.  One reviewer commented that this is a Best Picture contender, but I'm not sure on which planet those awards will be given out."
2167,the-incredibles-movie,ZeeM,10," My Favorite Animation Movie Ever! From Start To Finish, It Was Completely INCREDIBLE!"
2168,hereditary-movie,Goresomething,10,"I came into this movie with nothing but the highest expectations and boy were they completely exceeded.  As a long time horror fanatic I have seen it all and thought there was very little left in the genre that could shock me to my core; Ari Aster's debut left me not only shocked but inspired.  From the get-go Hereditary is a symphony of twisted camera work, implicitly dark tone, and magnetic performances that were eerily relatable.  As the film went on these components hurl the viewer into web of paranoia strung together by an antagonist that has no physical presence in the movie but is made more real by the confounding series of events.  I was struggling to sit still in my seat.  I genuinely felt my own sense of panic succumb to the cascade of macabre imagery and heavy thematic dialogue.  The films denouement is nothing sort of devastating and embodies the very definition of tragedy; haunting you long after the credits stop rolling and leaving you horrified.  On all elements this film is nothing short of a masterpiece; framing, tone, lighting, acting, story, editing, soundtrack... all of it assembled with such grace and love that it deserves a place among those classics that kept us awake at night. A+ work Ari can't wait for your next picture."
2169,x-men-apocalypse-movie,FinDefaulted,9,"I just finished watching it and I didn't even realise that it took 2.5h. I'm not a diehard x-men fan and just occasionally watch these marvel movies as they come out, so my opinions about the movie are of a casual movie goer. The movie doesn't need a ""complicated"" story like the Days of Future Past had to be good. A simple good vs evil is nice break from all that once in a while. Here we had a simple, but well working story.The main villain is introduced and his powers are explained well ahead of time before he actually appears doing anything, but the intro is absolute gold. I just felt that Apocalypse didn't really do anything really evil. He killed a dozen of normal people.Magneto was ripping everything around the world apart. Apocalypse shot nukes into the space.Wolverine killed a bunch of soldiers. Apocalypse enhanced Storms powers."
2170,madagascar-movie,MovieLonely94,7,"its not an excellent movie, but to be fair, its rather perfect. the animation is nice, the characters aren't so bad, and the songs are so nice and cool. Madagascar is a perfect summer flick for kids and adults."
2171,step-brothers-movie,TimK,3," A few chuckles, mostly due to the chemistry between Ferrell and Reilly, but overall unfunny and boring. The writers seem to think excessive profanity equals laughs. It doesn't. It runs a bit too long also."
2172,broken-flowers-movie,kathleen,1," Slow down? Slow down? you'd have to slip into a persistent vegetative state to appreciate the pace of this film. i want my money back. i want my time back. i want bill murray to get over himself and just accept the fact that he's a fabulous comedic actor. i'm really sorry that that doesn't do it for him, but don't take it out on me."
2173,the-good-dinosaur-movie,sanserif,1,"I admit this review might be sort of unfair. Why? Because I fell asleep somewhere in the middle. But hey-- that's not a great sign is it?? What makes this film unique and interesting? It starts and ends with the premise. ""What if the Dinosaurs survived? What happens then?"" Apparently, not much! I don't even know how the premise relates to the actual story... If altering the course of the earth and creating a parallel universe was all just so some little kid could meet up with a dinosaur and become 'sorta friends'.. then I'm sorry, that's just a total waste of a premise. From there on, you can approach this film two ways: Frustratingly illogical... or just incredibly bland and repetitive. I understand the production underwent a lot of revisions/problems and there were probably 30 uncredited writers on the film. It definitely shows. It feels safe and at times lacking strong direction or purpose. Why's the main character the 'Good' Dinosaur anyway? What did he do that was so good? And why the hell are they farming?? How the hell did they figure out how to farm? How many animals are smart enough to start farming? Why not give them blue jeans and eyeglasses while you're at it? The worst was the last scene, that was begging to be a tear jerker; in the end the dinosaur and the kid can't be together. The kid needs to be taken in by some RANDOM FAMILY THAT HE NEVER MET IN HIS LIFE. Why would you leave this kid with a bunch of strangers, that for all we know could be cannibals?? Why can't he just stay with his dinosaur friend? Because they don't look the same? Isn't that called segregation? Ohhh I know. Because they want to make it all sad and touchy-feely. Fine. Whatever. I'm tearing up because of how hard it's trying. It's pathetic. And it's just a terrible message. Aside from the story, I was not very impressed with the characters designs (aside from maybe the little cave boy) or art direction. They just felt super basic and unoriginal. A lot of the secondary characters felt like they were lifted right out of Ice Age. Sure, the environments felt super realistic and golly gee whiz, that sure is a great accomplishment. Technically. But c'mon.. how about being creative with things? If I want to see a photo realistic flower... I'll watch National Geographic. You just spent millions of dollars trying to make a 3D tree look like a real tree... why not just shoot video of a real tree if that's what you want. Ugh. The Croods (2013) may have had it's flaws, but it was so much better on every level. Go watch that instead."
2174,mad-max-fury-road-movie,ninnypick,1,Should have named it Mad Maxine. Max was gagged most of the movie so the real testosterone in the movie could do her thing. Silly and illogical. Waste of time and money.
