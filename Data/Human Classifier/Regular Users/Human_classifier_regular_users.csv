0,regular,0,"Firstly, Ben Affleck is definitely the best Batman ever. Already we know Henry Cavill so compitable with Superman role but, nobody wait Ben Affleck's extraordiary role. In my opinion, the film has two excuses. Firstly, it is really too long, approximately 150 minutes, if only it has 90 or 100 minutes and we can so satisfied. Secondly, that ""Martha"" thing. On relevant scene, Batman has advantage and he is so nervous, but when he heart ""Martha will die"" words he give up. This is weird. Yes, Martha is his mom, but this is not enough reason for giving up. In addition, soundtracks of film are amazing. Especially, when our three heroes (Batman-Superman-Wonder Woman) presented together musics are extraordinary. Speaking of Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot is as succesfull as Ben Affleck. She looks like completely her comic-book version. Finally, I really suggest this film and if you do not have any prejudice, you will like this film."
0,regular,0,"One of the most interesting of the series, maybe we will see an improvement in performance and the scenarios are still pleasant, the story is good."
1,regular,1," I loved the first two movies but this one was sadly far away from both. The action was sub par and not amazing, and the humor was so ridiculously juvenile it's shocking that anyone laughed. I kept a straight face throughout the entire thing because basically it wasn't funny. I enjoy Chris Tucker usually, but in this case I'm going to have to say no. Of course, if you're a loyal Rush Hour Fan then of course you'll go see it, but go in as I did, knowing you're only going for the sake of loyalty. Perhaps you'll enjoy it despite the copycat story, low energy action sequences, and ridiculous jokes. That or you'll shed a few tears because of how disappointed you are."

0,regular,0,"Without the performance of the actors breathing incredible genius into the main characters, this movie could have easily not delivered.  This as I found myself pondering long after, how could so much be conveyed and witnessed in the expressions and stillness of these characters with such sparing use of dialogue?  Genius, that's how!  Casting was critical!  It was mastery in the artists that came together to breath life into a story that unfolds a potential for humanity if we continue on this path of separation. The reality of it grips you.  You see what humanity becomes under desolate conditions.  It needs to be seen and felt by humanity. Having watched David Michod's first masterpiece, Animal Kingdom, he absolutely succeeded in delivering yet another 'masterpiece' of incredible artistry; from a story that was intense, and kept you riveted, to the incredible and stark, blunt, cinematography, and outstanding creative and captivating performances from lead actors Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson.  Michod's unique artistic style and brilliance is definitely evident in both of his movies. These two actors, with very little dialogue and much silence, so masterfully performed, conveyed depth of character that secured an emotional connection for each.  Guy Pearce showcased the rawness of his character, Eric, who he portrays as hardened and desensitized by his past journey, while Robert Pattinson showcased Rey as the child-like innocence, hope and purity that survived the collapse of society and civilized order -- after some sort of man made apocalypse, which many believe is humanity's biggest future enemy.  Pattinson delivered a thoroughly convincing performance for a character with Rey's challenges, a role that could have easily gone so wrong if overplayed as so many have done in similar roles.  He was brilliant, as was Pearce.  Their creative interpretation of these characters is artistry in itself.  A brilliant piece of work that needs to be seen! The audience was 60% Male and 40% female.  After the movie was over, I remained in my seat, as did others, as I felt torn and pondered it's totality.  It was worth the 1-1/2 hour drive to get there.  I'll be seeing it many more times.  It needs to be soaked in."
1,regular,1,"I gave this movie a 2 because of Matt Damon, really this wasn't District 9. The only resemblance to that movie was the authors love of future weaponry. The story seemed rushed with no real plausible plot, Spoilers frankly I understand the authors need to put the protagonist in a spot whereby there is no other choice but to go to Elysium, they fail to explain why these special machines (which would have to be manufactured on earth (because lets face it everything else is.. the robots are) are only available on this space station. Another rush job by Sony just trying to make a quick buck and allow their blanket marketing campaign to bring in the audiences. Wish I could have the time and money back. Sorry Neil, I liked your other movie.. this one sucks. Matt you seriously should have passed on this script."

0,regular,0,"My wife and I use Metacritic religiously to guide us in our near weekly movie selection.  This was a movie we both opted for before checking the Metacritic score.  My wife and I both adore Helen Mirren, and my several in my family were Holocaust survivors.  While we often concur with Metacritic, there are often major misses.  Most of them are of the film festival award winners, produced to impress movie critics rather than entertain moviegoers.  The best example was Tree of Life, which had a near 100 Metacritic score but we absolutely hated.  Woman in Gold was the opposite.  Perhaps it was our fondness for Mirren.  Perhaps it was my Holocaust sensitivity (I went to my ancestral home, Poland, last year, and visited Auschwitz-Birkenau, where we believe family members were murdered).  But we LOVED this movie.  I am the emotional one and cried like a baby.  Because it is a true story and portrayed reasonably realistically, it is impossible not to enjoy this movie.  Please go see it."
0,regular,0,"A fairly decent Bond movie, spectacular action scenes, great special effects, great cinematography and score and of course performances, but the problem is the plot. It is very by the numbers, unoriginal, there is not much to it, it is really your typical action movie plot and also the villain is really not exploited the right way. You have a great actor (Christoph Waltz) playing the villain and a lot of premise, but his talents are kind of wasted. They build the character for more than an hour and when he finally appears it is for maybe 2-3 short scenes where he does pretty much nothing and when he does do something it fails and he look moronic. But in the end, it is a very enjoyable as an action film, but definitely not as much as Skyfall or Casino Royale."

1,regular,1,"Did we see the same movie?  I love pretty much enjoy anything Jonah Hill is in. Even early highlights from his career like his short appearance in 40 Year Old Virgin or his amazing 13 hours of  sucking in Grandma's Boy to his Oscar nominated roles in Moneyball and Wolf of Wall Street are impressive. Besides a small handful of jokes that actually work, Hill not funny in 22 Jump Street, nor is Tanning Chatum. What a shame, I was hopeful it would be good. It's really bad. Skip this, for real!"

0,regular,0," I LOVED this movie SO, SO, SO, SO much. When I saw it for the 1st time I was so in love with it. I wanted to cry, but I disn't. The ending was lovely, and throughout the whole move I was just babck and forth. I was like Astonished, then angry. Happy, then sad, but overall I was so pleased with the movie. It is MOST definitely #1 on my movie list."
1,regular,1,"I got the impression Ryan Johnson got in to destroy Star wars lore and troll JJ Abram That's the only explanation I can come up with after Watching the last Jedi beside obviously Disney trying to sell us useless toys.More seriously I loved Rogue One and I very much enjoyed TFA.The latter wasn't perfect but the characters were consistent and very likable with a great dynamic between them, the action was on point and the question that were set up were nothing but exiting.And more importantly the Star wars mythos was still standing strong.TLJ however did not make any sense.It didn't bother making any significant and meaningful characters growth to the old and the new (aside surprisingly for rose)and to answer half the main driving questions and themes brought up in the previous episode(and when it did it was in very poor fashion or stupid manner). It isn't a bad made movie per say but Story and characters wise it was so off I got the impression that sometimes I was watching an entirely new but less entertaining saga.Plus nothing felt earn in it..aside from some nice visuals and action scenes there is not much there I enjoyed.Spoiler----If you are still reading my post and wanna know why I am so disappointed just look at the following and  tell me if i am wrong to be. - we still don't understand what the hell is the first order, whence they come and how they rose up to preeminence?-How the resistance came about to be ,why there is even one?-Where does Snoke come from? why is he so powerful? and how...can kylo kill him so easily knowing how powerful he is..like i am still scratching my head over this.-What is Rey's origin and why is she so powerful?(stating her parents are nobodies does not answer that a tiny bit)-Why Kylo turn to the dark sidewho and where are the knight of Ren? -How comes Finn has been able to escape from his conditioning as a Storm trooper.Why does Luke refuse to go back to help the resistance after he gave a map to R2D2 so that the resistance can find him ? How comes he cannot feel the force in Rey when he first see her?why would Luke even try to kill his young nephew when he is not even able to kill his dad (Darth Vader) who was the most evil villain beside the emperor we have ever witnessed and the almost perfect embodiment of darkness. Why would he wanna leave the whole galaxy without Jedi to protect it knowing evil is still around just because he got upset.Why would Finn try to leave the resistance knowing that Rey will come back after he's been ready to sacrifice his life for her three times?How does it happen that Finn can fight Captain Phasma so easily without any training and having been kicked his ass by a less ranked Stormtrooper.Why is kylo so obsessed with Rey without even knowing her ?How comes lea has power now?Why can Luke touch lea and lea touch him when no one is able to touch him, even kylo ?How come Snoke is killed in the second movie????why make a movie that doesn't follow the plot laid in the former one ?what was the point of Finn and Rose arc ?What about kilo training? nothing?What about Rey Training? nothing?Why make Luke a coward ?is Rey stronger than luke? how comes she is able to mate him?...come on guys!!See this movie can't save itself and to me Ryan Johnson just butchered star wars.Sure the prequels have problems and lots of them.Everyone can acknowledge that but this is just awful.Ryan johnson wasn't the man for the job he should have been given an entire new trilogy all for himself.Putting him in this one was a big mistake. He just ruins the all thing to me with his poor choices. Praising that film as the new empire strike back is a definitively a non sense to me. maybe i missed something but That movie was a failure to me.But that is just my opinion though."
0,regular,0,"Awesome movie. I wont go into to much detail but I really enjoyed it, I thought it might be just another pitch black and I'm not the biggest Riddick follower, but it really plays into the Riddick Series. I'd recommended watching it and I hope we get another!"
1,regular,1," I'm really trying to think of the reason this film got so many good reviews, but I can't. The movie had very few funny moments, although I didn't sit through the whole thing, it was too crude and boring."
0,regular,0,Like a bull ride from hell; people could not handle it because it was too wild. This movie pushed the limits of mental prejudice well beyond anything ever before tried. Bruno reveals prejudice in viewers by attempting to offend you as much as possible. If you were offended than the movies purpose was successful. If you were not you were able to see the hilarity that ensued on screen.
1,regular,1,"I really enjoyed the original. This movie is a literal copy and paste job. That wouldn't be so bad if it was funny, but it isn't. The overall concept and the escalation is no longer funny, there's nothing new (car chase, getting involved with criminals, bodily deformation, random animal and mini sidekick... it really is a shamefully unoriginal sellout), and the dialogue isn't funny... I think I laughed twice during this film. Avoid, even, or in fact especially, if you liked the original."
0,regular,0,"Over The Hedge is an original, mature kids movie that relies less on potty humor and has more grown-up jokes. The movie isn't explicit, just sophisticated. A talented cast including Bruce Willis and Steve Carrell make this a very good movie, even for adults."
0,regular,0,"I think this movie was so funny, just like its prodecessor, Despicable Me 1. It had an appropriate mixture of comedy, action and heartfelt family moments. However, some of the characters should've gotten more screen time and there could've been more romance to make the movie more exciting."
0,regular,0,"This movie is a perfect-to-watch-with-friends comedy. So perfect in fact, there wasn't a time where I wasn't at least smiling. It's humor is somewhat dated and slightly stupid, but it's actors carry it so well."

1,regular,1,"Don't let this latest Amy Schumer flick fool you. ""I Feel Pretty"" is neither funny, nor earnest in what it's trying to say. In fact, lemme' ask the question - what the hell is this movie even trying to say anuway? ""It's okay to look however you want?"" Well, the fat jokes and gluttony humor seem to squelch that theory, don't they? Okay, well, what about - ""it's okay to be insecure?"" Well, the movie seems to think so, but only if you're ""ugly."" In fact, if you're ""attractive"" and are insecure, your insecurity isn't legitimate, you aesthetically privileged  This movie is disingenuous, soulless, and thematically confused to an almost abhorrent fault. Also it's just not funny. It's a boring, overlong mish-mash of better movies. ""Big,"" ""What Women Want,"" ""Shallow Hal,"" even ""13 Going 30"" has more of an honest sense of theme than this. Just don't watch. Don't do it."
0,regular,0,"Not my favourite movie, but I have to admit... it is the best movie ever! And don't tell me ""godfather"" and that kind of movies because this is the most incredible story of friendship and redemption. I love Frank Darabont and for me, all of his movies are the best ever. The Mist, Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption are 3 movies that any director wanna do."

1,regular,1,"Stupid AF! I can't believe that anyone in the right mind could give this crap a passing mark. Of course, Kabbalists don't count as right in the head so I assume that the user score is pumped to the INCREDIBLE 7.3 thanks to those imbeciles. Dumb and boring beyond comprehension. But don't take my word for it: go see it. Why would I be the only one to waste two hours of life on this unimaginable junk?"
1,regular,1,"I swear, I liked the first 20 minutes, and the animation and effects were awesome, but when both the clich√É¬© ''human badass'' actors came in, it just ruined it to me. I was begging to god for the movie to end, and I almost slept in the last 10 minutes. Trash."
1,regular,1," I wish I had the time to do a video side by side of how many past episodes this movie shamelessly ripped off. Homer getting a Pig (Homer goes to college), Bart idolizing Flanders (Boy Scoutz 'n the Hood), Lisa crusading for the environment (The Old Man and Lisa), Springfield destroyed by pollution (Trash of the Titans), Homer goes on a hallucinogenic quest (El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer, and probably a few others), Marge and Homer having marital problems (every 6th episode), and that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Except none of it is as clever or smart or endearing as the show was for the first 10 seasons (more or less). Right about now, the shows creators would trot out the Comic Book Guy and have him point to me and say ""Worst Reviewer Ever!"", something they seemed to do a few seasons ago, for nearly every episode to deflect all the criticism the show had been receiving, rather than come to their senses. The sad reality is, The Simpsons has long faded from its intelligent, witty, and social relevance years ago. It has sadly devolved into a clich√©d, mishmash of recycling old episodes and tired jokes. What's worse is that newer episodes are typically stapled together with potty humor, drug jokes, and chronically arduous slapstick. Something, the series used to sparring incorporate, and mostly for irony. This movie practically drowns in exhaustive slapstick, and includes at least 2 blows to the... ""family jewels"". Word of mouth and positive reviews gave me hope that years of development time and rewrites could've signaled a return to its brilliant form. It didn't even come close."

1,regular,1,"Michael Bay is spinning his new dark comedy Pain &amp; Gain as a lower-budget personal project, a character piece that allows him to satisfy his fanciful muse before returning to less spiritually fulfilling endeavors. But don‚Äôt expect Sundance fodder from the man who previously blessed the world with Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, and other clattering cinematic migraines. Bay‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúsmall‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù is making a film not about giant robots‚Äîthe stars of his Transformers trilogy‚Äîbut manly men with the physiques and dimensions of giant robots. Set in sun-baked, steroid-addled ‚Äô90s Florida, Pain &amp; Gain buffs up an ostensibly true story of greed and ruthless ambition into a comic-book macho fantasy of upward mobility gone awry. Any pretensions of satire, moral ambiguity, or social commentary get lost in a hurricane of empty, mindless spectacle. Mark Wahlberg‚Äôs epic winning streak ends with the thankless lead role of a hotshot, morally slippery personal trainer who decides to take control of his life and his finances by kidnapping, torturing, and then seizing the assets of a rich, gaudy Jewish businessman (Tony Shalhoub). Often-unhelpful assistance arrives in the form of fellow gym freak Anthony Mackie and ex-con Dwayne Johnson, who clings to sobriety and faith as the cornerstones of a tough life. Due in no small part to the stupidity of the conspirators, the plot does not go according to plan. But that doesn't keep the overmatched crooks from plunging further and further into a world of criminality, from which they struggle to emerge with their lives or freedom intact. Pain &amp; Gain has one huge asset (literally) in the underrated Johnson, who lends his spiritual-struggler a sincere, poignant conviction (before he falls off the wagon) and a go-for-broke desperation (after he loses his spiritual center and embraces cocaine with the same intensity he once embraced Jesus‚Äô purifying love). The squirmy humanity of Johnson‚Äôs performance stands in sharp contrast to the gratingly excessive visual style; Bay manages to recreate the overbearing and frenetic qualities of his usual fare, but at a fraction of the budget. Pain &amp; Gain is less a satire of stupidity than a loud, brash, unapologetically vulgar celebration of aggression divorced from intellect. It‚Äôs the film Wahlberg and John C. Reilly‚Äôs characters in Boogie Nights would have written as a vehicle for themselves in a coked-up, narcissistic delirium, fatally unaware that the narrative makes them look like oblivious, dim-witted  not the swaggering, Tony Montana-like badasses of their pop-culture‚Äìwarped imaginations."

1,regular,1,"Connery is the ultimate Bond, Moore is the funny Bond, Dalton is the cool Bond, Brosnan is the suave Bond and Craig is... the ugly Bond? I have no idea why they came up with the ludicrous idea to pick Craig as the new Bond and why they decided to make Bond movies so dark and boring. In this movie Craig is coming out of the closet as gay Bond. Javier Bardem wants to kill his rival M, who keeps stalking Bond and following him around on every mission. Bond will be his and his alone... I was really happy when Judi Dench was finally killed of, that must have been the only positive thing about this otherwise dreadful movie. And I can't wait for the next actor to play the role of James Bond. It can't get any worse than this, can it?"
0,regular,0,"I thought this was excellent! I was very surprised by this film; I expected it to be good, but it was better than what I imagined. Nicole Kidman received an Oscar nomination for he role...I originally just assumed the Academy threw her in the lineup simply because she's a star and generally good in all of her films. I was completely wrong, as I was with the film, also. This film was great...one of my favorites of 2010! The film starts out a little slow, but once it picks up, it's so good. The thing I loved the most about the film is that the story is so common, yet completely real. I have never seen a film, dealing with the same basic plot line, feel as real as Rabbit Hole. The dialogue and screenplay was absolutely fantastic. I literally felt like I could have been standing in a neighbors home; the script was so realistic. The acting that went along with the fantastic script: Superb! Nicole Kidman gives a truly great performance. One of the best of her career, and absolutely worthy of her Oscar nomination. Aaron Eckhart also gives a fantastic performance...definitely among the best performances of his career. Hats off the supporting cast as well: Dianne Wiest, Tammy Blanchard, Miles Teller, and Sandra Oh...they all give very solid performances. I cannot speak more highly of this film! It truly blew me away. It was so simple, but real beyond belief. The acting is solid all across the board. See this film! I can't recommend it enough!"
1,regular,1,"I feel really bad for the people who gave this movie a positive review. Not a single person in their right mind would give this above a 2. The acting in this movie is absolutely dreadful, and atheists are portrayed as hateful people, just for the fun of it. It portrays the misotheist philosophy teacher as an indoctrinating son of a  That's rather ironic, as the sole purpose of this movie is to talk  about muslims and atheists, while portraying christians as perfect and right no matter what they do.

1,regular,1,"Unlike just about everyone in the world, I didn‚Äôt really care for this film. (Again, all hate mail please send directly to Hank.) I do think the film looks beautiful, they really spent time creating a believable world for these animals to live in. None of that is an issue for me. What is, is the fact I didn‚Äôt find this at all funny. And for a kids film made for kids (and furries) there should be some laughs. Or at least a few chuckles, right? Nothing. Dead silence. There were a few moments that did get what you might consider a ‚Äúchuckle‚Äù or what you humans call a ‚Äúlaugh‚Äù. Scenes include ‚Äì when the hounds start howling in kind of a domino effect. And of course the scene that is in the trailer with the slow as hell sloth that works at the DMV. Those were the only two that registered with me. This film didn‚Äôt really have any jokes. I‚Äôm not saying it has to be Ice Age or something. It doesn‚Äôt have to be filled with idiotic fart and poop gags, but some jokes would be nice. At least for the kids that have to watch this. Do it for their benefit. But that‚Äôs the thing. I don‚Äôt think was really made for kids. If I had to compare this to anything, it would be Who Framed Roger Rabbit. At least in tone. Zootopia is 48 Hours if it were played by animals. Maybe what threw me off was just that. I wasn‚Äôt expecting an adult buddy cop movie with cute bunnies. And you might be asking yourself, what is wrong with that? Nothing! Nothing is wrong with that. I want more adult geared animation to come out. Again, not everything has to be like Ice Age or the Madagascar films. Thank god. Now the biggest issue I had with the film. The predictable plot. As soon as a character shows up in the film, I knew instantly what was going to happen throughout the rest of the movie. This film also shares some comparisons to Cats &amp; Dogs. Think about it. Now this spoils not only Zootopia but also Cats &amp; Dogs, so you‚Äôve been warned. I know how much you‚Äôve been looking forward to finally seeing Cats &amp; Dogs, so I don‚Äôt want to ruin anything for you. Cats are kidnapping dogs, making them allergic to humans, so cats can be the dominate house pet. In Zootopia, predator animals are being drugged so their killer animal instincts kick back in, making non predator animals the now dominate‚Ä¶ um house pet. Predator animals run everything. The mayor is a lion and just about every animal on the police force is a male meat eating predator. So kind of like Cats &amp; Dogs, right? This was a film I was really looking forward to and was completely disappointed by. It looked beautiful and dealt with more adult issues you normally wouldn‚Äôt get out of something designed to keep kids occupied for 90 minutes. But I just wish it had a bit more humor and a less generic, predictable plot. - Capt. Peachfuzz"
1,regular,1," bad cast, story feels long and drawn out for a 90minute film. The Happening is just another flop from M Night."
1,regular,1," ""A depiction of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ as he is crucified in Jerusalem."" This monotonous movie relied on people finding this 12 hour period interesting; in reality who really cares? If the Bible or the story of Jesus was slightly believable I would of enjoyed this. However, as it is an insult to anyone remotely educated, I'd rather label this movie ""The last 120 minutes of Mel Gibson's directing career."""
1,regular,1," The movie abused the camcorder first person view. It was great for a while but shakey cam was pretty annoying. The movie used some guy's stupid going away party as a plot device so that when the monsters came, they'd all be together. The monster's origin wasn't even hinted at, leaving their existance and origin left COMPLETELY open for interpretation. I'm all for making the viewer think, but that was just lazy writing. The end, aka ""Thanks for your money"", tried to use ""the camcorder as the storyteller"" but completely failed. Massive disappointment."
1,regular,1," Some people are calling this the best film of all time. W. T. F. This film's characters were absolutely terrible. The acting was decent, especially from Phoenix, but everything else about it was quite lacking. Watch it with the professional eye and you'll see that the editing is in fact, quite non-professional and sloppy. The writing was without a doubt the worst thing about it. I don't know what some people see in it, all they look for in movies are action, which this film delivers solidly along with the acting, but does not do so with anything else."
0,regular,0,"This is the first great super hero film. It holds up very well even approaching 30 years into the future. It also introduced the world to Batman the way he is meant to be seen: a creature of the night, fighting against dark, twisted characters.Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson deliver flawless performances, creating the iconic Batman/Joker cinematic rivalry."
0,regular,0,"Thor has always been a difficult franchise for me. I like Marvel, I do think Chris Hemsworth is a decent actor, but the character didn't work for me. Not in the Avengers movies and definitely not in the Thor standalone movies. Too dour, too serious, the character isn't a lot of fun except for a few one lines. That is until this movie. He was fantastic. The humor bordered on too much, but never crossed that line of being too silly.The rest of the movie was pretty good as well. I liked having Hulk/Banner in the movie. I believe Marvel is underutilizing Mark Ruffalo and it was great to see him involved. I also enjoyed Scrapper 142 as a person who surprises Thor with her origins (won't say more for spoilers) and of course The Grand Master was awesome. How can people not love Jeff Goldblum. He is one of those people I could watch an hour of him just talking. I absolutely loved the storyline on his planet, the gladiators and the revolution.Sadly the part I didn't like was about Hela and the whole Asgard part. This part felt less fun, less interesting and seemed mostly a way to move around the pieces in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She wasn't interesting and I absolutely hated her outfit. That being said, it is fortunate they seem to spend more time dealing with Hulk/142/Thor on the scrap planet with The Grandmaster. It was pretty awesome.The one other thing though that this underlined was the way Marvel ignores women. So many little cameos in the movie, and the one little tiny thing involving Black Widow just reminded me that we haven't seen  a Black Widow movie, she gets less screen time then any of the others (even the Scarlett Witch, but she doesn't even get her own movie). I am not sure what the problem is with Marvel, they have the Black Panther coming up (and I am going to be there first in line to see it) but still no women led movies.The fact that D.C. has them beat on this just confuses me even more.That being said, the movie was great. Definitely in the top 5 Marvel movies for me and the best Thor movie period.The good: Action packed with a lot of fun moments. It was great to see Hulk/Banner as well, but Thor definitely made it his movie.The bad: The part in Asgard was not in sync for me with the rest of the movie, and the whole movie underscored Marvel's issues with female lead roles.Of course I will see the next one, and I like his short hair better."
0,regular,0,"At times when watching a monotonous documentary, there are feelings as though I was placed in a relatively interesting history class. In other words, while many documentaries have some appeal to them, a lot of them lean towards the lets lecture the audience motive instead of actually creating an entertaining experience. Exit Through The Gift Shop breaks this mold and instead creates a documentary that creates a narrative filled with comedy and artistry that depending on the person, one would hardly disregard. There has been wide speculation that Guettas story is another of Banskys pranks to fool its audience, hence the Brainwash. The artistry that is induced within Guettas works are of ridicule and it causes the audience to question the factuality of the film overall. While that may be called to question, there is no doubt that the film is entertaining. There are some stunning pieces of street art and present is an insight of this sub-mainstream movement. Banksy displays how street art is slowly being sold-out and that it is slowly become more prevalent in society than ever before. Overall, this film is insightful as well as engaging; it is crafted in a manner that it displays a fully played out story, with many elements contributing to the films overall success. It never seizes to be fascinating, and there is a sense of completeness that is absent in many movies of its genre. Anyone with interest in the world of street art or art as a whole will find Banksys film to be both compelling and intuitive."

Much hasn't changed for them or for director Danny Boyle. He still crams the film full of vibrant imagery, flashy editing, a pounding soundtrack and mildly extreme moments. (The Scottish accents are still sometimes hard to crack.) Flashbacks from the original add poignant moments, but the guys are as spunky as ever. There's not a lot of plot‚Ä¶just interactions between them, but it still holds up as a flashy cinematic reunion."

0,regular,0,"The Muppets is colorful, funny and has great music for give terrific entertainment for any kind of audience. It also has unofrgettable story-telling and breathtaking characters. This is not a classic, but Disney made a great election in take this film in the company. The Muppets are back on TV!!"

1,regular,1,"This film is shot on old cameras, in a 70s style documentary, that someone would have made on an old camcorder. Someone uncovers the tapes of this secret, classified, NASA mission, that was buried and turns it into this film. Apollo 18 shows how the astronauts came into contact with extra terrestrial life. I was expecting this to be a trippy Sci-Fi movie, it wasn't. I also thought maybe the aliens would be hostile and it would be an action packed horror flick, not really. The truth is, it's hard to say what this was besides bad! First of all, the look they use for effect, hampered the viewers, the constant interruption and flashes were just  annoying! The actors really have no dialogue outside of their work, meaning we know basically nothing about them, so there is no connection with the audience. The dialogue is bland, the effects are cheap, and the cinematography makes you want to vomit. It's not Paranormal Activity, nor is it the Blair Witch, it's a cheap rip off of both, that's not worth one minute of your time."
0,regular,0,"It's a real horror thrilling film with actual goosebumps raising on your arms. And it holds a perfectly gripping story- very horrific and violent though. The film is effective on the mind and is visually brilliant through horror and graphic. The tape is very scary as Gore Verbinski has made it. Very gripping and a masterpiece from start to Finish. Now, a normal sensitive person wouldn't watch this movie because its very very scary movie but if you look it by thriller it's very intense and gripping. The tape is very unusual and weird telling the horrific story of Samara Morgan the main focused part of the movie- the villain and the controller of the tape. You wouldn't get the climax and you would with Samara creaking out of the tv that the camera guy is watching."
0,regular,0,"Widely tense, powerfully written and well acted, ""The Pianist"" is a truly moving motion picture that manages to entertain everyone who likes war films."
1,regular,1," I'm speechess that most of your fools are taken in by the PR hype machine. Yes, the 3D is great but you need a story to go with. Not a remake of Dancing With Wolves and Pocohontas. After 30 minutes you know the ending which is coming another 2 1/2 hours later. Pure Hollywood PR Garbage. I dare you to watch this on regular TV again without the 3D glasses that they made us pay three bucks for. What a ripoff."
0,regular,0,"The Desolation of Smaug is a much improved instalment of the Hobbit franchise. The movie adopts a frenetic pace that captures the viewer whilst also exploring welcomed new fantastical themes within Middle Earth. It is clear that Peter Jackson has taken a much more colourful approach in his story telling of Middle Earth. The film never reaches the emotionally gripping and dark aspects of the Lord of the Rings, and rather takes a more vibrant and fun route. Whilst this provides a great film for the most part, it once again does not live up to the ridiculously high expectations set up by the Lord of the Rings. A good film nevertheless, ending on a painful cliffhanger that sets up the third film expertly."
1,regular,1,Such such SUCH a stupid movie!!! The effects are maybe the only good things in this movie! The story is soooooo lame! Why i have to write 150 characters when i can sum it up in a few words?!
0,regular,0,"A really fun movie with some really nice jokes and good action sequences, combined with witty back-and-forth banter between the main characters make The World's End a great ending to Three Flavours Cornetto (or whatever you want to call it) trilogy."
0,regular,0,"Absorbing documentary of the long odyssey of photographer Sebastiao Salgado. Touching pictures that mixes the beauty of nature and the human tragedy, some of them are heart breaking so breathless. A shall to see."
1,regular,1,"Although visually wonderful to behold, the story is downright dreadful and dull. People who expect a prequel to ""Alien"" will be disappointed, even if you just want to see a decent scifi-horror-flick you might leave the theatre dissatisfied. All of the characters seem to suffer from the infamous ""character in a horror movie disease"": They got the depth of cardboard cutouts and their actions are ranging from inconsiderate to insanely stupid."
1,regular,1," Visually beautiful. Captures a number of photogenic scenes and animates them- without bringing them to life. To analogize this film to the source material is to compare a soulless flesh-eating zombie to Frankenstein's tragic creation. It is a low-functioning, blood-thirsty automaton, oblivious to even its own state of undeath. To the dubious fanboys who actually rate this movie above 3, I suggest that you truly re-read Moore's masterpiece before presuming that its detractors have failed to intellectually digest the intricate themes of the original. Only a superficial appreciation of the graphic novel would lend this film any credibility as a faithful adaptation."
0,regular,0,"The thinking man's Pulp Fiction.  Yes, I liked it too, but this is way better.  If you're looking for sympathetic characters, you'll hate this movie. Chris McQuarrie very deliberately cut a favorite dialogue from this movie because it evoked sympathy for one of the characters.  ALL are flawed, such is life. I've run into a couple people who tell me, ""I just couldn't get past Ryan Phillippe.""  He fits the role and works very well with it, whatever else he's done (I've seen nothing else he's been in so I don't have a bias.)  Benicio is pretty great in this, Caan is wonderful. Dialogue is grand.  You get little scenes that by themselves are gems but put together in this movie sequence can have a gut-punching effect.  The poetry of the entire film taken as a whole is so good, you'll want to replay it from the beginning once you see the end. REWATCHABLE: yes"
1,regular,1,"One of the worst movies i have ever seen! even my wife hated it. two hours of my life i will never get back. if you have trouble falling asleep, watch this movie, its like watching paint dry."
0,regular,0,"Collateral is a very enjoyable film for the most part, a clever variation on psycho-horror and hostage-thriller films. It is easily one of Tom Cruise's strongest performances (and quite creepily, when he intentionally plays ""mad"", he comes across as rather reserved, especially compared to his perceived off-screen persona). The dialogue throughout crackles - the script is of an extremely high quality, and both leads handle the material with extreme skill. My only problem with the script is an over-reliance on cliched psychoanalytic conversation (debating the morals of killing indiscriminately for instance), Vincent's veiled threats and Max's attempts to keep level-headed were engaging enough without them trying to ""understand"" each other - Vincent's dangerous, we get it! The film works as a solid and effective thriller right up until the final act. Here it resorts to a succession of increasingly silly set pieces further undermined by lack of attention to detail (what does and doesn't go off in a power cut for instance). Perhaps Mann would have been better off wrapping things up thirty minutes earlier, ending on a high with the truly exhilarating nightclub set piece. Despite its flaws, in the end Collateral is a pleasant diversion - it's perhaps not as clever as it thinks it's being, but as entertainment it dazzles."
1,regular,1,"Kiddie movie about time travel with teenagers who cant do anything right. Its completely uninteresting. No humor, no action, really bad plot, and a horrible premise. This is yet another dumb genius movie brought to us by a clueless writer and director. At some point they need to realize just how insulting such characterizations are to real smart people and that nailing this into the minds of the young and uneducated is absolutely not good for society. At the very least, make this a comedy like Back to the Future but no... this is just a monotonous mess. Teens discover a way to time travel... and like any brain dead moron, what do they do? Send themselves despite many failed experiments that proved how dangerous the attempt is to make. And what do they do with the time travel? Well of course... the most important thing in life is to go back to high school and humiliate a bully who picked on you... and go watch a decade old concert. Stupid movie all around for people with very low to no intelligence to speak of."
1,regular,1,"Jenna Fischer is a wonderful actress. Nevertheless, A Little Help is a tad bit too depressing for the girl we know and love from The Office. There's little purpose surrounding the near-constant depression of the flick--how is that entertaining?"
0,regular,0,"Big Steve has once again brought to the screen a gripping story of war, family, sacrifice and redemption. Make no mistake, however, this film is no ""Saving Private Ryan."" His cinematographer is the same and naturally John Williams has provided an excellent musical score but the protagonist this time is a horse named Joey.World War I serves as the back drop, as we follow Joey from an English farm to the battlefields of France. Joey has to be sold to an English cavalry officer due to his family's financial misfortunes. He winds up serving with the German army, spending time with a young French girl and her grandfather and ends up stranded in a barb wired section of ""no man's land."" Spielberg has crafted a satisfying ending to a long (2 hours, 30 minutes) journey for both horse and owner. This movie has none of the blood and gore of Saving Private Ryan although there are plenty of battle scenes and casualties. I have to assume this an attempt to appeal to a wider audience. As much as I loved Saving Private Ryan, it was so emotionally jarring that I can't watch it again from start to finish. War Horse doesn't have that type of impact but it's a good story certainly worth watching more than once."
1,regular,1,"Everything felt rushed, miscued &amp; unexplained in the last 90 minutes.  The last 30 minutes made generally no sense.  After Batman 2 which was brilliant, this movie had me consistently asking why were most of the characters so idiotic in their thinking.  A few bad actors in place as well; and the ending?  Really? How could Batman survive that?  Maybe if his batwing morphed int an amphibious craft.  Just a LOT of unexplained holes that had you asking, how'd he get there?, why don't they just...? I really hate it when movie that supposed to be great, leaves you analyzing the direction job.  The voice of Bane to me just didn't fit either, it sounded like a 70 year old college professor."
1,regular,1," This movie was pretty horrible. Drawn-out, dull, poor transitioning between scenes, and truly terrible camera work. I was not emotionally invested in any of the characters, and Christian Bale in particular was very miscast. This may have all been redeemed had the movie actually been entertaining, but at no point did I think it was. I'd strongly recommend avoiding it, despite positive reviews from the professional media."
0,regular,0,"I'm actually not a big fan of the team-up MCU movies. I think The Avengers is mediocre and Age of Ultron to be pretty bad. I like the singular movies just fine though (i.e. Iron Man 1 and 3, Captain America 1 &amp; 2, Thor movies etc). Civil War blew me away with how good it actually is. Dramatic moments in the movie actually had a lot of feeling, the actors really meshed well together in this one and the newcomers (Black Panther and Spider-Man) totally stole the show. I never really cared for Spider-Man until I saw this movie. Now I am pumped to see Spider-Man: Homecoming. The same goes for Black Panther; I can't wait to see his solo outing in 2018.The only negatives I could only think of were the first 15 minutes or so were kinda meh in my opinion and that the title Captain America: Civil War doesn't really make much sense considering this really isn't a Captain America movie. I would named it Marvel's Civil War or something along those lines.Well, I still can't believe it. Batman and Superman are my favorite superheroes of all-time (even though I haven't seen Batman V. Superman yet, mainly because of waiting to see the ""Ultimate Edition"" instead of the critically panned theatrical version). I grew up with those heroes and love them to death. But Captain America: Civil War is the best superhero movie of the year.EDIT: I liked Batman v Superman better."

0,regular,0," I cannot believe how many negative comments were posted for this movie. The movie captures the BIOGRAPHICAL events that one man endures in order to gain status and, more importantly, happiness in a world that is against him. Hollywood did not try to spruce up the plot because there was no need. The story actually happened! How can one say that the movie is 'unbelievable' when the events actually took place? I feel that Hollywood did a fantastic job of capturing the essence of the ""American Dream"": through diligence, strife, and dedication, one can achieve great things. The actors in this movie were very plausible. I was easily able to empathize with each of the main characters, while still maintaining a consistent sympathy for Will Smith's struggle to the top. For those out there who are looking for a well-developed, self-made man type of movie, look no further. As stated before, this movie is based off of ACTUAL events. If the viewer keeps this in mind, I see no reason why one could not enjoy 'The Pursuit of Happyness'."
0,regular,0,"This film wasn't what I expected at all, but it was more of a pleasant suprize than anything else. The animation, while being goregous, isn't too overdone, and the cg elements implement wonderfully. If you have not seen its predecessor, ""The Girl Who Leapt  Through Time"" definately check it out too. This story actually has a great message about family and respect, and is definatey worth the look."
1,regular,1,"What a piece of St!! This film is SO OVERRATED. The Queen is boring, stupid, ignorant and a lost of time, the acting of Mirren is good but not for an Oscar, please to all the critics READ (read important things) and if you want to see an excellent acting of Mirren look THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER, that is a really Masterpiece, not this crap."
0,regular,0,"A nice change of pace for Star Wars, coming off the awful prequels, and TFA. Easily the best since Jedi, and it's my personal favorite since Empire. The movie has some of the best cinematography, and Michael Giacchino on the score is a great choice. Memorable movie, and one of the best Star Wars films"
0,regular,0,"While Taken 3 was nowhere near as exciting as the first two films, it at least made a lot more sense, as far as the story goes, than the second one. This is the sequel that the first film deserved. Liam Neeson does a solid job, though he is beginning to show his age. Forest Whitaker plays the exact same role he always does but he does it well. It ended kind of weak but it was definitely a good movie overall."

1,regular,1,the woman in Black may be a well shot at times and have some credible acting but it's not scary in any way and it shocking how bad it is in the writing department . the creepy atmosphere that the first managed to achieve is largely gone in favour of Jump Scare after Jump scare and none of them work and often ruin the scenes pacing.  the plot is also incredibly predictable and a lot of time really doesn't make sense but i've come to expect that from horror films now. why would i want enduring characters that i want to see make it when i can have these idiots
1,regular,1," There are much better ""ninja"" movies out there than this. That both out perform it in action and story. 70% of the movie is in the dark and you can't see anything. The other 30% things are happening so fast you don't really see any action. and the story is worthless."
0,regular,0," A very captivating and interesting story. Celine's personality suites a woman's emotions and points of view.

0,regular,0,"When I left this movie, I felt conflicted. It had taken almost all of my expectations and completely flipped them on their head. I was expecting a much different movie to the one I got. However, after careful consideration, both of the movie itself and for what it does to Star Wars canon, I have decided that I quite like this movie.I do disagree with a number of choices this movie made, from having Luke be even more of a washed up hermit than I expected him to be, to killing off Snoke at such an early stage. However, I don't think it deserves the level of hate it has gotten. Once I made peace with the decisions the movie made, I was able to see it as what it was, a beautifully made movie that makes hard choices that move the franchise in a bold new direction. And as much as it hurts to let the past die, I'm confident that this new direction can give life to Star Wars for decades to come.On the other side, I don't think this movie is AS revolutionary as some people are making it out to be. The Jedi order is not being thrown away; it's returning to its roots, to a time before they had become the complacent, Republic-serving, priestly Order they had become. There's a blink-and-you-miss-it moment in the Last Jedi, where you see that the sacred Jedi texts were, in fact, not in that tree when it caught on fire. Rey and secretly taken them with her when she left, as evidenced a by them being shown on the Falcon at the end as Finn is grabbing a blanket. Thus, when Yoda set the tree ablaze, he wasn't burning down the Jedi tradition, because as an omniscient Force ghost, he knew the books weren't there. That means when he said ""Those books don't contain anything the girl Rey doesn't already have,"" he literally meant that she has the books. This means when she is training to become a Jedi, and eventually training a new Jedi Order herself, she'll be building it from the original Jedi teachings.Really, this movie brings the whole saga full circle, enhancing the prequels by acknowledging how the Jedi failed during that era and making it a central plot point. The Jedi philosophy isn't bad, no, what the Jedi had become over a thousand years of peace and complacency is bad. This film makes the promise that the Jedi Order will be rebuilt to be what is was originally supposed to be. And that makes me excited for the future. (Also the possible future of showing what the old Jedi Order was like when it was still in it's full glory, Rian Johnson trilogy anyone?) But that's just my opinion."

It's definitely not visually dark and dull. Just sit and enjoy for the pure entertainment of it! That's why it is classified as fiction and not as a documentary. What is it? No cartoon characters? No male/female relationship problems, cheating, unwanted pergnancies, shoot 'em ups, car chases, sex, or other similarly bane plots?

0,regular,0," After much anticipation, the wait is finally over. Despite heavy scrutiny from everyone around me including most of my friends and my coworkers who deemed my excited behavior childish, I went to watch Rocky Balboa on opening night with the only two people who were excited as I was - my brother and one of my coworkers. Before I get deeper into my reactions of Sly's latest installation into the beloved Rocky series, let it be known that whatever I am about to write, I do not intend it as a review as I believe the Rocky series have gone beyond that which needs a movie ""review"". To me, and hopefully many others as well, Rocky has reached an echelon in it's own class. There are sequels, and there are trilogy's, but the Rocky series has impounded and unsurmountable amount of impact and influence into the lives of those who've kept faith in a character whom I feel is the truest hero that represents the meaning of courage, love and moral values. How many Hollywood heroes can you say that about? The Rocky series, at its core, is not about beating up bad guys, swash buckling adventure, or saving the world. It's a story about Rocky Balboa, a man with a big heart who goes through the ups and down of life in its most extreme. Boxing was always just a tool to illustrate the trials of life that he goes through. All throughout the series, Rocky never fights anyone in particular. In actuality, every one of his fights were internal. In the first Rocky, he ""goes the distance"" with Apollo Creed, but it was never about winning the fight. He was given an opportunity and the fight was about how far he could take himself. In essence, he was fighting himself. This underlying motif manifests itself best in the first Rocky and the latest, ""Rocky Balboa"". It does seem to get less apparent as the movies evolves from an Oscar winning drama into quintessential hollywood flicks, but it never really disappears. Some may criticize the series as getting lost from its original meaning, detracting to senseless action and formulaic plots. I would agree to a point, but I am not complaining at all! In fact, I applaud it for what it has become. As extensions of the original, the series has brought us the most memorable moments in film history. Who could forget the fight with Mr. T (""dead meat"") in Rocky III or the big Russian dude, Drago (""I will break you"") in Rocky IV. Nonetheless, beyond the adrenaline filled fight scenes and cool one-liners, these sequels still contained the core value that brought alive the character Rocky and the unforgiving world that is created. Time and time, Rocky is tested and the result is that he has to fight, but it was never ever for himself in the selfish sense. After going the distance, he fights for Adrian in the second (giving her a better life), and then he fights for Micky (but not for vengeance), and in the fourth he fights for Apollo who stood for America (again not for vengeance). Actually, my man Bill Simmons believes Rocky single handedly ended the Cold War!  Like Bill Simmons, I don't know how many times I've watched Rocky. You can not deny the characters' influence over our lucky generation. Rocky Balboa is by far a much better role model than the so-called heroes on film these days. [SPOILER] It just brings you to tears to see Rocky after all these years and long after Adrian's death, spending time in front of her grave and revisiting places they've been together. That is true love - undying love. ""Adrian is dead, but she never is in here"". This concept of love, I believe, is dead in the new generation brought up by MTV. Rocky stands for those heroes, famous athletes, or celebrities who are as nice in person as he is in the media (if there are any). A prime example of this kind of moral value that is lacking in not only movie heroes, but professional athletes and celebrities alike, is a scene in Rocky Balboa where Rocky goes and just casually changes the light bulb for a friend he just met. This kind of gesture is subtle but it is nonetheless powerful and reminds us that nice guys do exist. We are living in a generation of people who are more realists than idealists who accept ""darker"" versions of classic heroes like Batman and James Bond because to them it seems more ""believable"". It is nice to be reminded that throughout all these years and even though times have changed, Rocky still retains his high moral esteem. Rocky is still Rocky. The strength of his character has been tested, having been pinned against multiple opponents and the quality of his character comes in full breadth in ""Rocky Balboa"" and for one last time, it reminds us of an old belief that has been long lost. Thank you Mr. Stallone. You have truly created an unforgettable character and an epic story that should be retold with every generation so that his values can be passed throughout time. Just don't be like George Lucas and re-release the series with inserted scenes and computer graphics."
1,regular,1," Really tedious. The first one: Ok, we get it..old movies had scratches in the film and drop-outs. Not sure what he was trying to accomplish..folks dressed like people in 70's movies, driving old cars, sending messages on their PDA's (?). Some shots borrowed directly from old films, other stuff shot very contemporary...should have picked a style and stuck with it.Tarantino needs to quit sticking that mutant mug of his in front of the camera..the guy is not an actor. First one went on WAY too long. Second movie...did anyone really buy Kurt Russell as a menacing old stuntman? A few moments, but about 1.5 hours in I started checking my watch and saw quite a few folks give up and walk out. Meatheads will give it a good review because they think that this shows they have an appreciation of what the two hack directors were trying to do. Don't believe the hype...spend your time watching actual old grindhouse movies."

0,regular,0," One of my favourite movies. The production/direction/cinematography is astonishing. I love the transitions, esp the transition from B/W to color at the beginning. Keep in mind that this is a movie not a play. The visuals and the acting are paramount, not the operatic singing. Gerard Butler is excellent, showing the rage of a madman. I have watched it 7 times already."
1,regular,1," Some spoilers... but trust me, you aren't missing much ""Cloverfield"" offers no more than its amazing trailer - no more thrills, no more clarification, no more... well, anything. Except the face of the monster, which, because of the camerawork, isn't clear. What begins as a story that seems decidedly human quickly devolves into cliches (the lost love, the frantic search for lost love, the panicky, bewildered looks of those in danger, the poor decision making skills of self-appointed leaders) that become more tiresome when you realize that The Camera Is Still Rolling; that is, the poor sap who's following his friends around during a rampage is still holding a camera. (This plot hole is remedied in one dumbshit line: ""The world will need to know what happened!"" or something equally asinine). Drop it and run, pal. Speaking of the camerawork, the POV is interesting for the first twenty minutes, but becomes tedious as the plot and ""near escapes"" become progressively more preposterous. The principal characters survive multiple attacks: one seems to be impaled (but lives), three are in a helicopter crash - and survive!, and two watch a friend devoured alive... but the monster leaves them alone. All this would be made palpable if the acting was clever, witty, or pulled more than just Acting 101 grab-bag crap, but it doesn't. From the cameraman's incessant ""What's going on?! Where's Rob going?!"" to the farewells before the ending (which are hilariously awful, cherry-picking from The Blair Witch Project), the actors' ""spontaneity"" is never fully convincing. This film was a huge letdown."
0,regular,0," Great film, very informing, and entertaining to boot! Of course, you must understand that this film is biased. However, it sheds light on major issues that plague the United States. I've noticed that most people giving this a low rating are assuming that Moore is trying to paint a picture that says, ""our health care system is broken, countries like Canada are better."" This is not the case. All Moore is doing is showing us that universal healthcare is possible, and that it works. As the most powerful and wealthy country in the world, Moore (and I) believe that we can adopt such a system, and attempt to remove the negatives that people are talking about. If you take nothing else from this film, be opened minded enough to notice the horrible things corporate greed and crooked politicians - on both the right and left - are doing to this country."
1,regular,1,"The Revenant's story is flat and difficult to accept as realistic or mythic. It may be magic realism but that doesn't make this particular story an effective narrative- its strengths lie in the visual trip it takes you on. However, what story it does have ruins that visual trip, unlike in the best works of Malick or Tarkovsky, where the natural imagery and the dreaminess better compliment the narrative, and vice-versa. It's not realistic, despite being 'based' on a true story, because it keeps the main character alive past all biological possibility. (For those who would quibble with the 'true story' factor, the actual story of Hugh Glass doesn't have the main character defy death ten times over. Furthermore it's a 'true story' of a mountain man doing something extraordinary. This usually means it's a tall tale.) And if Glass' death-defiance is meant to subtly show the main character as a kind of undead or supernatural being (or ambiguously or liminally so), that idea is not developed interestingly. Even worse, if Glass' endurance and death-defiance are supernatural, then his determination is irrelevant and the theme seems to be: 'family love powers magic revenge'. That's an F for story to me. I suppose that there could be some sort of grand allegorical meaning, but since the story doesn't work on the literal level, that potential is irrelevant to me. Although others may see it differently, the highest score I can give a narrative film with a zero for story is a 3 out of 10. I find it sadly amusing that after Birdman, with its examination of the perils of ego, Inarritu follows with an egomaniacal stunt of his own."
1,regular,1,"The main characters aren't particularly interesting and the director mostly stays neutral, letting them tell their own story. The end result is a very dull documentary that probably won't change your perspective on marriage or art."

0,regular,0,"Wasn't sure of this movie at first, bought it on DVD and was entertained from beginning to end. Thought the inclusion of Electro would be difficult to pull off, but the storyline was effective and the cgi amazing! So many storylines were crammed into this movie, Peter's parents, Electro, Green Goblin (Harry Osborn), the romantic relationship between Peter and Gwen and yet it was all thoroughly satisfying and enjoyable.  The cast were all exceptional they brought the characters to life. Better than the first and also better than the original, with a twist ending that gave Spiderman a real reason as to why he needs to protect his identity, which i thought was missing in the originals. I couldn't ask for anything more from a movie, i highly recommend you buy it on DVD or Blu-ray."

1,regular,1,I agree with some of the recent negative reviews. I posted a negative review a week ago and it was erased. Are any of these 10 reviews for real? My wife and I thought it was really boring and long. My friends who saw this movie with their kids also said their kids wanted to leave the theater because it was boring and made no sense. The animation was choppy and overall story line was creepy and way too long. Who is behind all these positive reviews?
1,regular,1,Batman was used as a guise to draw us into a slasher movie. With HL dying the advance PR worked fabulously. If not for the PR this movie would draw flies. The PG 13 rating only goes to prove that the Motion Picture ratings can be bought. Do not bring any children to this bloodfest.

1,regular,1,"By far the worst HP film yet!  Way too much exposition. Lets take five minutes to focus on HP getting a hair cut.  I guess they spent all of the budget on SPFX, as they clearly could not afford an editor!    I could have chopped the film down to 20 minutes, if not less.  The last film should have been one part, not two.  The idea to ake it two parts was clearly a studio idea to make more money."
0,regular,0,"Tom Hanks and director Clint Eastwood team up together for this biopic about Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger who miraculously made a last-second emergency landing on the Hudson river, saving 155 people on board. The result is a well-acted and often times informative and compelling, albeit straightforward and somewhat uneven-feeling retelling. Like I said, the acting was exceptional. Hanks is as reliable as always, as is Aaron Eckhart by his side. The story itself also provided some interesting insight  into the event. However, it also ultimately felt a little rushed, straightforward, and a bit too short, running at only a little over an hour and a half. It also felt as though the retelling was a little disjointed and uneven at times, as it jumped back and forth between the landing incident and real time a bit too much and I felt as though a better balance could've been found. Overall, I certainly wouldn't consider it a perfect or flawless biopic by any means, but it still hits enough marks with Hanks' and Eckhart's performances, as well as the overall intriguing and impressive true story."
1,regular,1,"My new least favourite phrase: ""Part 1"". Pretentious, jarringly hollow and unrelentingly drab, this latest entry in 'The Hunger Games' franchise is a sloppy, clumsy and cloddish exploration of the power of political propaganda and inspiration to alleviate suffering and strengthen the collective human spirit. Devoid of any engaging plot progressions, fleshed-out characters, or captivating narrative, this wafer-thin shell of a movie fails to illustrate the intrigue of the mythos that's drawn minds all over the world."
1,regular,1," This was the first movie I have ever walked out of. It was not funny for the most part, and was actually quite disgusting. Don't waste your money."
1,regular,1,Why do I feel like the director of this movie watched the Hunger Games followed by Under Siege 2 (or any other train movie) and then decided to make a really bad combination of the two? It saddens me to think that people are giving this movie any kind of positive review since it is so generic and has dialog that doesn't seem to translate over to an American audience very well. Skip this movie. Your time is worth something.
0,regular,0,"The true power of this movie, is the simple subtle honesty.  It does not try to give great big background stories, or hugely emotional 'have it all out' redemption.  It let you see the pain each character feels, let you guess at some of the experiences these characters had gone through.  Words DONT solve everything, and they certainly dont always help.  Much of our lives and relationships are subconciously built around things Unspoken, and this movie recognises this and therefore makes its interactions more honest becuase of it.Also, the fight scenes were spot on.  Honestly brutal, while not being overly bloodthirsty.  If your fighting at that level, you need focus.  Without it, your just brawling.  The overwhelming intensity of Tommy (Tom Hardy) is almost shocking.  Made more so becuase there is no boasting, no glorification, no real menace to him, he is just that strong, just that physically powerful.  This contrasts with his brother who has little actual physical presence, but a focus and a drive that makes it possible for him to challenge at this level.  i.e. Tommy knocks you out, Brenden taps you out etc.Part of the power of the enstrangement in this film is that Brenden is just as eager for forgiveness and reconcilliation from his younger brother as their father is, even while he struggles with unreconcilled jelousy from the attention 'Tommy' got from their father (who was training Tommy in junior wrestling).  While Tommy is just a huge powerderkeg of continued PTS, Survivors guilt and emotional abandonment.To be honest, I think it might have been a bit too suble and unspoken on occasion, so many people who have not had any similar expeciences, or known anyone who had, may not have grasped the true ramifications of what was left unspoken.  In particular the Surviors guilt for Tommy and Brenden's first true understanding of the regret that unresolved guilt brings.  I thought it was a brilliant movie.  Entertaining, powerful, interesting and quality. It was not shown at a lot of cinema's in America (prob becuase of the whole 'friendly fire' issue) so it wont make the money it normally would, but I expect it will do a brisk trade on DVD.  And to be honest it was not really advertised as the emotional sucker punch it actually was.  The fighting, while entertaining, wasnt the focal point of the movie at all.  Becuase of this its viewing base may be mislead.  A lot of people who would truly enjoy this movie may be scared off by the apparent physical violence of it.  If you are one of those people, go watch it.  It is seriously worth it."
0,regular,0,"Although Helen Mirren, Ciar√É¬°n Hinds and Tom Wilkinson get top billing because of their star power, they are actually the supporting cast.  Most of the film is about the three young actors that play them 30 years ago.  They go to communist East Germany to capture a former Concentration Camp torturer so they can take him back to Israel for trials for his misdeeds, but they bungle the kidnapping.  I thought the film was well acted and it held my attention the entire time.  The only problem I had was that the older actors looked NOTHING like they younger ones with the exception of Helen Mirren.  They should have found actors that at least looked similar to each other.  Some of this film is not easy to watch, particularily the Gynecologist scenes so be prepared.  It deserves its R rating."

1,regular,1," This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. In a movie every scene is supposed to relate to either the end or the charactor or a turning point to either the postive or nagative. To have sex scenes with none of the above criteria is at less bad writing and is more then likly titlation(SP) for it's own sake. Unfortuneatly, even sex for sex sakes they don't manage to do well. Mortensen and Bello are just not attractive."

0,regular,0,"Featuring a trio of fantastic performances from Michael C. Hall, Sam Shepherd, and a rejuvenated Don Johnson, sporting an off-kilter 80s-esque electro score, and an engaging plot ripe with welcomely subverting turns in direction, Cold in July will probably go down (unfortunately) as one of the most underrated films of the year. True, the film adds little new context to the repercussions of violence and the expectations of masculinity that impose upon simple men. There is also a kind of corn-brained logic to some of the plot twists, but it never comes across as ridiculous, more campy and fun. If I had to compare this film tonally to something else from this year, Blue Ruin comes to mind, as well as the Nicolas Cage vehicle, Joe. While not nearly as seamless in presenting it's thrills as Blue Ruin or emotionally resonant as Joe, Cold in July still earns merit for being a competently made thriller that has characters more rich than we've come to expect from the genre, as well as an unbridled momentum that builds to a (albeit, predictable) satisfying finale. Worth recommending."

Brilliantly and intelligently directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who definitely deserves an Academy Award for Best Director, The Hurt Locker is intense, suspenseful, exciting, and thrilling. The acting is superb, especially by main actor Jeremy Renner, whose performance is totally real, raw, and brilliant. Renner deserves an Academy Award for Best Actor. I warn you that you won"
1,regular,1,Really Annoying Movie!
1,regular,1,"Now the first movie was great and it blew everyone away, so of course, we were excited for this one. We hoped that it would live up to the first one. Well, we were wrong. So, so, wrong. Admittedly, the first half of the movie is bad, but it was bearable. We got a few action sequences that were cool to watch. But everything goes downhill real fast after Optimus Prime dies. From there on out, its straight up boring, and the finale is very disappointing. Tons of boring dialogue and filler. You just end up not caring and just want the movie to end. Now of course, I have to give props where props are deserved. The visual effects were cool, CGI was still amazing and everything looked real. But, Michael Bay went all out with his Bay-isms. Racism, hot actresses and extras that he is probably trying to pork, and of course, tons and tons of explosions. In the last movie, there weren't too many and they fit into the movie perfectly. In this one, he went overboard with all the explosions. No matter what happened, there was an explosion. Pencil falls, EXPLOSION! Someone falls down, EXPLOSION! This movie also had an incredibly long run time. This movie is boring and it sucks."
0,regular,0," A complex terrific movie. Long movies (3 hours) tend to be something special-especially good or especially bad. This one is especially good. If the movie can capture your interest and attention for 3 hours, it has an advantage shorter movies can't match. As you invest your time, you begin to care for the characters in a way beyond criticism. When I start reacting viscerally to a movie it gets a 10 from me."
1,regular,1,"I gave this film a 1 because I don't really believe in giving movies a zero. But Dirty Grandpa barely passes as a movie. While I understand that the title and previews are supposed to weed out certain viewers, I went into the theater with the appropriate mindset: it was going to be funny, and nothing else. I found it to be more awkward and stupid than hilarious. The writing is beyond awful, and the characters are so one-dimensional they might as well have put paper cutouts of Zac Efron and Robert Deniro on camera. The humor is just uncomfortable, and not because I find the topics in the movie to be inherently unfunny. It's because of the delivery and the aforementioned terrible writing. One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time."
1,regular,1," Pathetic...this was one of the most stupid, predicted movie I have ever seen."
1,regular,1,"Unmitigated swill.  We have come to expect much better when Brad Pitt is aboard, since he's a talented draw who can pick and choose his projects.  This film, however, demonstrates only that these days, the bigger the budget, the stupider the film.  There is almost no plot here, just a zillion cartoonish, CGI  zombies with rabies getting shot, hacked, burned, stabbed and punched as they just keep comin'. The moment of suspense, such as it is, is near the end, when Brad Pitt must retrieve the save-the-world serum from a lab where zombies dwell. The stupidest plot point of the year involved Pitt's wife and kids getting 86'd from their safe haven by the Guvamint. You have to see it to laugh at it.  I'm sure a dozen absolutely talentless hacks worked on the alleged script."

1,regular,1,"This certain cure for insomnia plays as an adaptation of scenes scraped off the cutting room floors of Godfather and Goodfellas, plus one or two from The Wolf of Wall Street. The monotony is occasionally broken up by the film's only saving grace - the chemistry between Isaac and Chastain, who shine in their scenes together. Unfortunately, they are too few and far between, and this insipid drama shows just how little it has to say about any of the themes it touches on but makes no effort to try and explore. The lack of pace, action and plot development in the screenplay make A Most Violent Year, a most exhaustingly boring film."
0,regular,0,"Hell or High Water is a brilliantly written and masterfully directed movie about a man trying to get his sons out of ""dirt"" the hard way, and the consequences it carries, whilst giving a notion of a two way street when it comes to law."
1,regular,1,"Really, really, really disappointing. Usually I cope well with film adaptations - changes are necessary and a film needs to have its own vision. But everything that made the book great has been stripped away leaving nothing but some interesting visual effects (hence the 2 marks). The hikikomori theme (or the Western version of it) was the emotional heart of the book. Massive missed opportunity."
1,regular,1,"Not even slightly scary. The weird fast forward thing they did when the ""ghosts"" appeared was pretty awful. The ghosts in general just looked like normal people in costumes. The fact they act like this is a true story is pretty hilarious with how fake everything looked. The soundtrack is great though."

While not quite up to par with the original Spanish version, this movie still carries a great deal more weight than the majority of mass-market movies.

1,regular,1,"This was one of the the most pretentious and awful Sci Fi horror'esque movies I have seen in a long time. Save your money. Terrible casting, Jennifer Jason Leigh is so bad I actually almost fell asleep. The rest of the supporting cast is terrible. Terrible dialogue as well. One scene in particular with Portman and her colleague in a private moment actually made me laugh out loud. That never happens to me. The movie has no idea what it wants to be. The ending is NOT thought provoking, it's lazy, under developed and full of superficial substance leaving the innards as hollow as can be. I didn't even pay to see this and felt robbed. This is coming from a life long sci Fi and horror junkie. I loved ex machina but this was a huge let down. What is wrong with critics? If they are rating the movie based on visual aesthetics and a diverse cast meaning ladies only, then sure this is an 8 out of 10, but when digging deeper, this is a hollowed out experience with little substance, much like the majority of new theatrical IP we are seeing today. This was a mish mash of ex machina, the thing, predator, the arrival etc... You're better off sticking to those movies, they did it better...1/10 for me."
1,regular,1,I was forced to watch this movie for a school assignment. I was excited to see it because of the reviews that it had. To say the least I was totally disappointed. I thought it was poorly written and directed. Worse yet the theme of the movie only encourages the rift between races.
0,regular,0,"Minor spoilers.  It's a solid movie but is also the weakest of Jackson's Tolkien adaptations.  There were some very good scenes, such as the escape scene and the Beorn sequence.  However, there were some very weak scenes involving Tauriel.  The character just didn't work.  I've been fine with most of Jackson's deviations in the other movies.  However, the addition of Tauriel and the big changes in Smaug's scenes bothered me quite a bit.  I still found the movie to be enjoyable, but it's far from Jackson's best work."
1,regular,1,"I went into this movie with higher expectations than Batman Vs Superman and they were outright crushed.  I thought Viola Davis, Will Smith, Jared Leto and Jay Hernandez were decent enough, but was surprised at how unawesome Margot Robbie actually was as Harley Quinn (outside of what you see in the trailers).  Storey was a jumbled mess and I have seen better action in an episode of Paw Patrol.  Not the final nail in the coffin for DC movies, but I honestly felt the train went seriously off the rails on this film."
0,regular,0,"A well put together and interesting movie. Honestly, it is insane that it has such a low critic score. If you like movies that keep you guessing like Fight Club or Eternal Sunshine, then you will enjoy this movie. It's confusing because it's meant to be and it triumphs in being entertaining until the end reveal. And on a second viewing, everything makes sense and is one cohesive picture. As others point out, there are many Fantasy vs. Reality films out there, many with more shocking ""twists"", but Vanilla Sky is a gripping movie in it's own right and me and my friends definitely enjoyed watching it even now, a decade after it's original release."
0,regular,0,The Weather Man is more than entertainment. It is reflections of the life of a weather as his life crumbles around him. His life starts off low then gets lower but through endless struggles of trying to impress his Pulitzer prize winning father and to mend his broken relationship. His career however looks like it might save him as tries desperately to become a national weather man. Overall very uplifting and it might have changed the way I view the world. Do not watch for light entertainment. This movie may answer the question of the meaning of life.
1,regular,1,"This doesn't even come close to the BBC series' quality. Jane Austen's spirit is not present, the thing is unwitty and illustrative. Ewen worse, it's conceived in an eye-pokingly populist manner. The proper costumes of the period were changed from classisict to romantic for a 'better' look, and the story itself was relieved of Austen's social observations, and warped into something imponderous like a short story in a woman's magazine. Through the film I could only think of the 'creative' team behind, brain-storming about how to make just about every aspect and detail 'consumable'. Too bad that so many reviews proved to be unreliable for me."
0,regular,0," Absolutely brilliant. Never was it truer that it was the best of times and also the worst of times back in the 60's. The Beatles music comes to life as their lyrics take on a crystal clear meaning. The age of innocence followed by the Viet Nam War, the Civil distress and all the mayhem that followed. The cast is brilliant, the acting and directing superb. This is definitely a movie that is a must see."
1,regular,1,"‚ÄúBeatriz at Dinner‚Äù stars Salma Hayek and John Lithgow in this story of a poor Mexican immigrant and health care provider who, by circumstance, becomes a dinner guest at a party given by one of her clients where she has a confrontation with a multi billionaire played by Mr. Lithgow. When I first read the rave review in the LA Times, it seemed like this was a must-see film so I dutifully went on its opening day to view it. What a mistake. The writing and directing of this film leaves much to be desired with a plot that makes no sense and a character study that is both unrealistic and improbable. For the most part the fault is in the writing by Mike White for he portrays Ms. Hayek‚Äôs character with so many faces and traits that is difficult to believe that anyone like this could exist. The film is uncomfortable to watch for there is no sense of reality or credibility and what could have been an interesting class conflict film becomes an absurd viewing experience. I give the film a 1 rating with a warning to the prospective viewer to RSVP that he or she cannot attend this particular dinner party."

I wasn't offended but insulted that someone would try to pass off something so lazy, and at times mean spirited, as a movie.

Yes it did provoke some thought at the end and for that it get 3 points. The other 90% of the film unfortunately fits into my most hated category.

This movie is unbearably boring, the story is unbelievably dumb with plot holes every where with a cringe worthy ending. The only redeeming quality this movie has is the scenes when Fassbender goes into the animus and goes back to the past, and it only happens about three times the entire movie. Trust me im the biggest Assassins creed fanboy, i've played every single game since the first game was released, i wanted this movie to be good, but it didn't."

1,regular,1,"In the span of two hours of dreadful script and forceful plot, any glint of opulence can't save ""Gods of Egypt"" from being mindlessly numb. ""Gods of Egypt"" asks an age old question, ""Does flashy sparkle outweighs written words?‚Äù. Unfortunately for the two hours movie, its visual is inconsistent and the story has so many illogical flaws, that whatever gorgeous scenery it has would feel bland. Furthermore, the acting is sloppy, having less-than-charismatic characters mumbling cringe-worthy monologue for half its time. This is the tedious story of Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), the supposed king of fictional Egypt where gods and mortals live side by side. He then finds opposition from his uncle Set (Gerard Butler). He then forms unusual alliance with Bek (Brenton Thwaites), a human thief with a single-minded drive for juvenile  love. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Gerard Butler are not bad, they have experience on this type of epic saga as Jaime Lannister and Leonidas, respectively. However, this also feels as though they are just going through the motion. Here they are shades, less appealing and more brooding version of their famous roles. Bek as the other main lead is your typical charming hoodlum without the charm. His characterization is too rigid and any attempt to romanticized or deliver witty humor is instead annoying. The two leading females are too over zealously created for flamboyant melodramatic romance. There are a couple decent supporting cast such as Rufus Sewell as Urshu and Chadwick Boseman as Thoth, but they merely have small portions of spotlight. The script feels forced to create any chemistry between the characters, however it often sounds like soap opera. Not to mention story line is plagued by awful plot devices. Being gods doesn't exemplify them from having sudden illogical and convenient twists, a few of these might be fine, but after half dozen times audience would appreciate more explanation than simple magic. Visual is arguably pretty. At its best the movie offers some aesthetically pleasing scenes and the costumes worn as well as the set are very easy on the eyes. Still, among these beautiful people and vistas, it's not often to see it smeared by strangely subpar CGI, as though these are Transformers made from low budget production. Tainted by shady narrative, corrupted visual and barren script, ""Gods of Egypt"" is mindlessly numb."

1,regular,1," Terrible... This was actually 2 movies in 1 where neither had anything to do with each other. One being the obvious Madea comedy and the other an over the top drama. I was waiting the entire time for how these two plots would weave intricately together and show how the two lives would affect each other. Instead they just ended up at the same jail and had a couple minor scenes together. In fact, the whole idea of ""Madea goes to jail"" is misleading. She was probably in jail for about 20 minutes of the movie and half the time was spent in a cliche montage as the days of a calendar get counted off. For as little as the jail had to do with anything, it might as well have been called, ""Madea drives a car"" or ""Madea gets angry"". Sadly ""Ernest goes to jail"" had more of a plot and purpose than this movie."

1,regular,1,"I am shocked at seeing all the 10s given by user critics here. Not surprised by the high marks given by the critic reviewers though since many of them are no doubt in league with Disney. But seriously, there is so much wrong with this movie that even the beginning of the movie is a mess. Here is my review of only the first 15 minutes or so of the film: (it only went downhill from there IMHO). During the attack on Lor San Tekka's village Kylo decides to take Poe Dameron captive to learn what he did with the information he was given by Lor San Tekka. I have several questions at this point in the script the writers obviously ignored or just didnt think about: 1. If Kylo has such a command of the force which enables him to read minds then why didnt he also take Lor San into custody as well and read his mind before cutting him assunder with his nifty claymore style light sabre??? Seems like a pretty valuable and huge opportunity that a smarter sith lord in training or smarter writer wouldn't have missed! 2. When Kylo asked some of the Storm Troopers to search Poe's X-wing why didn't he ask them if a droid was on the ship? I would think by now the Empire/First Order would know that the Rebels/Resistance use droids for navigation and in flight repairs on their fighters. I am pretty sure a smarter sith lord in training or writer would have not missed this observation! 3.Why didnt the Storm Troopers notice droid tracts leading away from the X-wing...tracks that even a Storm Trooper should be able to follow? Considering how fast BB-8 was shown to move in the film the Storm Troopers could have brought back the droid in plenty of time for Kylo to place Poe in front of his own blaster shot force hanging in mid air and then release said blaster shot into Poe. Now wouldnt that have been a sight - Poe ends up blasting himself with his own weapon in front of all the villagers. A smarter sith lord in training or writer would have done this and then let the rest of the villagers live just to tell the story of how ""bad ass"" he is! I am not even a writer but i feel my scenario is far better than JJ Abrams version and I am only minutes into the film. However, this is the first of many many plot holes through out the film with so many I am beyond supprised it made it into production. If the next film is no better I am going to write off Star Wars movies for good and stick to shows like 'Game of Thrones' where the writing though not perfect is ""parsecs"" ahead."

1,discrepant,0,"I'm honestly very surprised about how many people are stating about how faithful the movie is to the book. While I did enjoy how we learned more to Seneca Crane's backstory (even though that does subtract from the surprise of learning of his death in the second book/movie), it seemed to me that the screenplay took the crucial aspects of the book, then rewrote all the dialogue. I understand the need to keep things trimmed down, and the book is massive in scope, but there were countless moments where I was waiting for a particular line that I liked from the book, only to find it was changed, seemingly for no reason, to a weaker line (""Did I actually get a pair of fighters this year?""). Now, massive dialogue changes aside, I couldn't help but find the major tweak to the origins of the mockingjay pin being a bit upsetting. The mockingjay pin is probably the best known symbol for Katniss and becomes very important in the later books/movies, yet, the source becomes some random vendor from the Hobb (whom I'd like to imagine was Greasy Sae, although that's never explained). Trying to look at this movie from the perspective of someone who's never read the book, I felt that everything from the start of the games on was just rushed. The part I was probably looking forward to the most was Cinna's costumes. Yet, I found myself completely disappointed. My imagination certainly did a better job than the special effects folks, as the costumes were honestly rather mundane. After Katniss was stung by the trackerjackers, Rue applied the leaves which improved her wounds, yet, the movie never explained what those leaves were for. The romance between Katniss and Peeta? I felt it in the book, but in the movie, the chemistry just wasn't there. It wasn't the actors, but rather how rushed the story had become at that point. I understand that a first person book is extremely hard to transform into a movie, but I still can't help but think we should have seen more from Katniss's perspective. Hearing some of her thoughts and explanations would have been far better than the occasional scene swap to some announcers trying to fill in the clueless audience. Significant changes from the book to movie adaptation that I thought were particularly unneeded included:"

0,mixed,0,"The general consensus of the bad reviews from critics is that NO ESCAPE is a good-to-terrific action thriller that spoiled by racism. But the movie makes clear that all of the violence in the world is a result of first-world meddling and exploitation. It's the story of an American family in a foreign country that is experiencing an out of control violent revolution. It all happens on the first day the family arrives in the country. So there is no chance to bond or communicate or understand the culture. There is an overwhelming war zone environment immediately thrust upon them and in fairness to the filmmakers, another country in the region is portrayed as peaceful, courageous, supportive. All this means, if you want to see a really taut, violent, extremely suspenseful action movie about an American family thrust into overwhelming danger for 24 hours, check it out, while remembering that many who've seen the film are offended by it. I found the writing, direction and performances solid and the creation of suspense powerful. I didn't find it overly racist, but so many people who I respect did have that reaction, so perhaps I'm looking past their objections. You can make up your mind once you've seen it."

0,regular,0,"Generally Iron Man movies are not trying to aim for Academy Awards or anything so distinctive that makes a standing ovation. Iron Man 3 is no exception; the film does not pretentiously depict itself as that. Whilst it has toned down on the humour for more character development and darker tone overall, it is presented in a serviceable if not above average manner. Tony Stark's journey from Iron Man 1 is somewhat complete, and I do like how they try to depict a man with PTSD post-Avengers, and how he tries to plan ahead and cope with it. However halfway through, it seems that this arc somehow dropped off the radar, and reached a conclusion without ever seeing any sort of resolution. It is less Iron Man, more Stark (kinda like TDKR), but unlike Rises I do feel that there was a sort of smooth story-telling going on. However, it also feels like there was less exposition on how stuff works in-universe (it sounds anal until you walk out and ask yourself 'How did X did that?'), and it feels like the pacing was meant to distract us from that. Plot in itself is somewhat complex, which isn't mind-boggling for an Iron Man movie. Nevertheless, there is some depth here and there, but the main villain's motives are somewhat intriguing, yet felt like it was used more properly in other stories or movies. The audience relies upon exposition from characters for the reveal of the villain's plot and motives, and whilst it does build-up quite nicely to a crescendo at the third act, you feel like this takes a back-seat as you get more amped up with action from Iron Man Perhaps one of the most divisive plot twists in movie I've ever seen was the reveal of Mandarin. Now whilst I am no fan of the comics, I can tell that this is going to upset lots of fans. However, in the discourse of the movie I feel that this twist was suitable. It managed to salvage an overused trope of depicting terrorism in a stereotypical way and give it a bit of flavour, but not by a jaw-dropping degree.Humour in this movie is very hit and miss. RDJ is still a good Stark, but the dark tones mean that jokes are quite limited to almost cliched and old humour. You aren't going to get much laugh unless your humour limit is quite low. OK, so for Paltrow, I feel like there wasn't much screen time for her, and the one's she has had such radical shifts in depiction that you feel like missing much of her side of the story. One minute she's a damsel in distress, the next she an ass-kicking hero. Its too radical, and underutilising her to the point you feel that she was but a Checkov's gun. In but one scene, I feel that there was some effort to put in depth to the character, but the main focus is clearly on Stark and she is but an accessory/plot device. Overall, Iron Man 3 is above average for a superhero movie. Perhaps because it doesn't try to be pretentious to be something jaw-dropping that makes me more forgiving about it. Stark's journey is complete in terms of character development, and whilst his psyche post-Avengers wasn't properly told well IMO, it does come to an end that is somewhat satisfying. The plot is fine, but will piss lots of comic book fans as to how much liberty the director took with the original material (and probably why some reviews down here are quite anal on THAT aspect alone). Action was typical of a superhero movie, and is quite enjoyable while it lasted, but it does not leave quite a lasting impression."
0,regular,0," 'Babel' has four compelling stories that might indeed make four interesting films. Unfortunately, even though the narrative holding them together is more clearly defined than in his last two features, the interconnections between these four stories make each of them feel a bit like tangents instead of revelations. The cast is superb and the film is fascinating and emotionally arresting throughout, but the ending doesn't really bring these four seemingly disparate stories together as one might expect, and, as a result, the film as a whole is slightly unsatisfying. Nonetheless, 'Babel' has much to offer the patient, perceptive viewer and is most certainly worth watching! As a note, 2006 was a great year for Spanish directors. 'Volver,' 'Pan's Labrynth, 'Children of Men,' and, of course, 'Babel' are all great examples of the talent and artistry that reside outside of Hollywood."

Rodriguez also does a good job but she more or less just plays the same character that she always plays. The rest of the cast were just forgettable. As to the movie as a whole, it was a decent horror that did have some chills and did a good job capturing the tone of the games, or at least the first two games. Overall: An enjoyable movie that is perhaps one of the better video game movie adaptations."

1,regular,1,"Pure marketing driven movie making, with little actual development, just abrupt plot changes.  Everything that was built-up in the first movie, is easily discarded by a highschool plot that wants to be more Michael Bay than the man himself.  Apparently ending with a 45 cinematic scene is enough to appease those whom are easily entertained, so they forget all the plot holes and abrupt conclusions for significant characters.  The rest of us are left wondering why this movie was necessary at all, given how little actual development occurred during the first hour and 45 minutes.  Rey suddenly becomes a sword master before Luke begins training.  The master himself, the very embodiment of forgiveness (especially for a family member) is turned into a homicidal, alien nipple sucking (for laughs apparently) imitation of what he is supposed to be.Edit - to all those claiming any view but your own must be due to trolls, you should look in the mirror and see what you have become.  Also, for those blaming the writers, the only writer is Rian Johnson (the director).  You can add a little for JJ Abrams as the Exec.

0,regular,0,"Heading into A Ghost Story, one cannot be blamed for assuming it is an examination of grief. With a young husband (Casey Affleck) dying early on and wife (Rooney Mara) mourning his loss, eating pie, and trying to move on without him, it is easy to see how the film is about grief. Yet, in equal measure, it is a film about memory, time, purpose, music, stories, and every little detail that makes life so eternal, so essential, and universal. It is a film about grief shown through the lens of an unexpected protagonist - the ghost under a sheet - who traverses time, space, people, and location. Powerful, poignant, and silently accomplished, A Ghost Story is a rousing return to form for director David Lowery after working for Disney last year. In this low-key, gorgeous, and powerful film, Lowery re-establishes himself as the heir apparent to Terrence Malick's cinematic poetry throne.Silently sewing together images, Lowery's camera frequently finds stunning images. From the very beginning, shots of Affleck's ghost walking through open fields to get back home with the sun peaking over the horizon, the ghost lurking in the background with Mara in the foreground, or the shot of light pouring in as the home is destroyed, A Ghost Story is a film with stunning visuals. This was very much the case with Lowery's prior effort Ain't Them Bodies Saints - which also starred Affleck and Mara - and it is nice to see him return to this gorgeous style. However, compared to that film, Lowery is much less reliant on the beauty of the outdoors to create stunning imagery in A Ghost Story. Rather, he now relies upon drab gray and brown interiors, dark shadows, and a largely gloomy home that is fashioned as a prison cell for this ghost for the rest of eternity until he finds what he has been looking for all this time. Dark, ominous, and spooky, this locale is one that would work for a horror film, but rather, Lowery uses it as a place for existential horror. This ghost is doomed to stay here until he can get the note left behind by Mara that he wants to retrieve, yet he is unable to break through the painted wall to reach the note. Trapped, lonely, and solemn, the ghost's existence is one of little joy, pain (especially when Mara tries to move on), and anger at how he has been so easily forgotten.However, what is perhaps most interesting is how the aspect ratio communicates so much. Lowery himself has stated it was to make the film more claustrophobic to show how trapped the ghost is in this home, but that is just scratching the surface. With a squareish frame and rounded edges with drab colors, the film often looks like an old photograph. This is particularly pertinent due to the film's thoughts regarding memories and the little pieces of ourselves that we leave behind. Being remembered, our memories, and our brief time on Earth after which we are forgotten forever, are all constantly on the mind of A Ghost Story throughout. Mara leaving little notes of things she likes in houses she moves from, the quiet mourning of her husband, and a party guest speaking about memory and Beethoven, all exemplify this element of the film. Yet, what is abundantly clear in A Ghost Story is that time does not matter. It will advance, things will be left behind, people die, and people move on to other places. In the end, the only thing that does matter are the little pieces of ourselves we leave in the hearts and souls of those we touch. As Affleck silently lingers in the background with Mara eating a piece of pie, this fact is felt. She does not need to say anything, nor does he. Both miss one another and it is not because they existed, were in that home, or were even because they were married. Rather, it is because they both touched one another's lives and, now, circumstance and a freak accident have taken them apart from one another. Instead of holding one another, they now are left wallow in the solitude and thickness of the air in the home as they try to soothe the hole in their hearts.With a minimal script that often amounts to a character standing stationary for a period of time to the ambitious time traveling finale, A Ghost Story is a film that is nearly impossible to not compare to the work of Malick. Yet, it is not just in the style and ambition that Lowery manages to capture the feeling of Malick's best works, but also in the feelings they emote. The best Malick films, such as The Tree of Life, are ambitious and show life from the very beginning to the present day with a silent, melodic, and poetic flow to the proceedings. A Ghost Story is very much the same way. Instead of being a typical narrative film, A Ghost Story is often best described as visual poetry. Through small suggestions, such as what is on the paper (it is the quote from the book that Affleck knocks off the shelf and Mara reads for sure), or through this gorgeous mosaic of images that, on their own, often communicate every emotion and purpose perfectly, Lowery"
1,regular,1,Is it watchable? No. Plot: Super-duper idiot steps on loose boulder wedged between canyon. Falls down. Nothing happens for 1.5 hours apart from him doing stupid stuff like drinking all his water instantly. Looks at knife. Knife is blunt. Checks again 1 second later. Is sharp as can be. Cuts arm off (takes suprisingly long.). Puts wound in bag which he urinated in. Runs off. Helicopter spawns out of nowhere to whisk him off. The end! Review: it sucks badly.
0,regular,0," Good stuff, but the PG-13 rating does take away from some of the McClane-isims. Other than that, visually awesome, great action sequences, and plenty of cool baddy deaths. I hope they make a 5th film and I hope it is R. It is just weird not to see the blood splatters reminicent of the original trilogy. Like in DH when John is crawling under the table, Takagi's brains, and of course DH2 has some of the most bloody deaths ie: Robert Patrick through the vent grate, and In DH3 we have the elevator splatter. Anyway, I could talk about men's fashion and industrialization all day but I'm afraid work must intrude. Go see this film., and hope they make another two!"

0,regular,0,"John Carter reviewI forced myself to go see John Carter. √Ç¬†The movie was getting a 50 on metacritic and rotten tomatoes. √Ç¬†My wife and I have not seen a movie in months and were getting desparate, we refuse to pay $20 to see mediocre quality movies. √Ç¬†We are both fans of the books, but the trailers looked terrible, the principals seemed miscast and the marketing was never focused. √Ç¬† So with trepidation and apprehension we went to see John Carter. Many times through this movie I kept expecting it to suck. It never did. When the credits began to roll I turned to my wife and asked, ""That was awesome, right?"" She said, ""It was SO AWESOME!""The movie did has some faults. √Ç¬†It was a little long and some of the cgi flying scenes were muddy and felt rushed through production.But everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING else, was fantastic. √Ç¬†John Carter is a character with an arc that I was rooting for and felt real compassion for. √Ç¬†Dejah was beautiful, powerful and had real chemistry with John. √Ç¬†The Green martians were completely believable and expertly created. √Ç¬†And seeing Julius Caesar and Marc Antony chewing up a few scenes together was a complete delight. √Ç¬†Anyone who saw the HBO mini series Rome will know what I mean. √Ç¬†They were like two old friends thrilled to be performing together again. √Ç¬†I would pay $10 a week just to watch them have more adventures together on Mars.I had no trouble following the story. √Ç¬†In fact, the addition of the advanced beings improve the plot immensely by giving the viewer a way to understand how John Carter came to Mars and it's connection to Earth. √Ç¬†It is also impressive how much of ERB's original plot was kept in the movie. √Ç¬†A plot that came 100 years before Avatar.I will end this review by complimenting the director and the cinematographer. √Ç¬†Outstanding. You created a world that I believe. A world with its own cultures, myths, architecture, and beauty, yet kept it familiar by making some of the tech similar to the 1880's and shooting on location in Utah. √Ç¬†A marvelous achievement.It saddens me deeply that I will not be seeing further adventures of John Carter of Mars. √Ç¬†I see no way for it to be profitable. √Ç¬†It cost too much to make and for reasons I truly don't understand the reviews have been mixed. √Ç¬†I myself, a John Carter fan, narrowly skipped out from seeing this movie. √Ç¬†I now feel it is my duty to use the power of the Internet to say see this movie. √Ç¬†Go with an open mind and a desire for old fashioned fun and adventure. √Ç¬†Then maybe, just maybe, like John himself, we can all go back to Barsoom."

1,regular,1,"As a long time star trek fan,  I expected much more -  at least as good as the previous movies.   I was disappointed.  There was so much effort in doing cool graphics - that it pulled the movie down.  The movie seemed like it would never end.  The actors did not come close to the performance of the actors in the previous movies.   Save your money folks,  Most of the Star Trek movies warranted going back to ""see it again"",   This one doesn't."

I too thought the film would just be something to take up time. The start to the film was slow but really set the scene for the film with great characterisation from the start. The film really got going after a slow 30 minute start but then carried on to keep my attention. A really good film with a great ending leaving a big smile on my face as the plot was easy to follow but made you think as well. Great film worth a watch or buy!"

0,regular,0,"This movie has a great plot line with a lot of interesting sub-plots. Excellent performances by Chastain and Elba. But what's really amazing about the movie is the dialogue. When you go see a film written by Aaron Sorkin, you need to pay attention or you will miss something. The other good thing about Sorkin's screenplays is that he explains things. In this case, Sorkin also directed and he did a marvelous job! I never thought Michael Cena could play a bad guy well as he does in this movie. I'm now so disappointed in the real life actor that Michael Cena's character represents, who seemed like such a nice guy...until now. That actor deserves being exposed like this. The other LA actors that were named elsewhere came off really well. Most (except for the Michael Cena character) were a bunch of LA actors who needed extra stimulation that their excessive money had given them, and they seemed to play fair. Unfortunately, once the game moves from Los Angeles to New York, the players are much more dangerous and the game changes completely."

0,regular,0,"A pretty big step in the right direction. April O'Neil (still not a redhead) and Vernon are kept in their sidekick roles, we get a more respectable portrayal of Shredder, there are more classic villains, and the turtles are the main focus like they should have been in the first movie. The result is a movie much more enjoyable for TMNT fans. The plot is pure nonsense. Both the enemies and the turtles have access to some absurd technology that serves only the purpose of making it as convenient as possible for the villains to have a plan and the turtles to pick up on it. From there it's the standard save the world from ending by powering down some crazy device plot setup that we've seen so much since the start of the superhero movie craze. At least the heroes in a half shell have their own identities this time around, despite the nonsensical and borrowed plot. Aside from basically being April O'Neil: The Movie, one of the more key flaws to the first of this rebooted series is that it's tone borrowed so much from the other heroes we've seen onscreen lately. There was some of The Dark Knight, Man of Steel, Spider-Man, and so on. The turtles themselves had their signature personalities, but it was hard to pick up on it with all these other superheroes' tones floating around. The fact that the spotlight was on Megan Fox's O'Neil for so much of that movie didn't help either. It ultimately just didn't feel much like a TMNT movie. Out of the Shadows helps to rectify that mistake. The turtles are front and center in their own movie, like it should have been the first time around. Their lovable personalities are intact and come together just as excellently as ever. The results are a lot of laughs and four dudes you just can't help but root for. Sure we've seen their ""we can't work together"" drama brought on from their differing personalities repeated in countless forms of TMNT entertainment ad nauseam, but it's worth putting up with just to see these guys return to form on the big-screen. The action is still CGI-fueled big spectacle. Expect to see a lot of stuff go boom. Thankfully though, despite having Michael Bay's name attached to it, this never reaches Transformers level of visual noise. With the turtles at the center of it, it's still really entertaining to watch. Even if doesn't make much sense how the side-characters are able to take out groups on ninja's without the help of the brothers. Villains like Bebop and Rocksteady make things even more exciting. While not completely out of the woods yet, the rebooted series gets better with this sequel. The writing could still use some work, but the turtles feel more themselves. The inclusion of classic characters and elements make it a bigger hit for TMNT fans young and old, although the stronger language is not appreciated and may have some parents wanting to cover the younger watchers ears. It may still be big, Hollywood superhero absurdity, but there are enough improvements to maybe get you to slip out a cowabunga or two. 7.5/10"
1,regular,1,This film is so plagued with technical errors somebody should be accountable. They discharge the fire extinguishers yet the engines keep running. Every jet pilot in the world knows if you pull the fire handle it cuts the fuel and the engine stops!
1,regular,1," One of the worst superhero movies to date. Someone should tell Joel Schumacher that ice skates, bat-credit cards, nipple suits, homoerotic statues, and neon lit thugs don't make a good movie."
0,regular,0," This is a gorgeous movie, transfixing from beginning to end. The animation at the beginning is awe-inspiring and the story is cute, but serious enough to get the point through. I understand some kids not finding it to be their cup of tea, not privy to many of the clever references and jokes, but I think to thoroughly dislike this film one would have to be heartless, blind, and entirely miss the point. I think that those complaining about the lack of dialogue should consider expanding their tastes (and maybe think about WHY there is little dialogue, other than the fact they are robots), and those who say it is preachy are probably reacting to some deep guilt they harbour with regards to their own day to day practices."
1,regular,1,"Horrific remake and an even worse film. The main problem with Poltergeist (1982) is... everything. The special effects come out of my video game console, the acting seems mostly cardboard throughout the entire thing and the dialogue is just... awful. It's not remotely believable. They keynotes and highlights of the original are quickly rushed into the audience's spotlight and are given nowhere near as much significance as the original. The composition on the film's score is just atrocious - I feel someone dub-step Youtuber could have done a much better job. Avoid this film."
0,regular,0,"Marvel president Kevin Feige announced late last year that there will be a noticeable difference between Marvel Films Pre-Infinity War and Post-Infinity War, and the latest release from the studio quite clearly proves this point.Black Panther, mistakenly labeled as the first African-American superhero in cinema: Blade, Storm, War Machine, even Frozone from the Incredibles, has turned into the banner for diversity in the Marvel universe.Yes, the culture and political standpoints that the film tackles are very relevant and downright powerful at times, yet the mass media seems to want to pigeonhole the film to serve its own political agenda.The fact of the matter is, Black Panther is a great film because it is a well-executed, well-acted, heartfelt genuine film ‚Äì that‚Äôs all.The film follows T‚ÄôChalla who returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to become king, but when a powerful old enemy reappears, T‚ÄôChalla‚Äôs mettle as king‚Äîand Black Panther‚Äîis tested when he is drawn into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk.One of the first elements that draw attention is the film‚Äôs beautiful color palette which is chock full of vibrant African colors, patterns and ultimately captures the African tradition and weaves it throughout the film‚Äôs visual landscape and narrative.Veteran costume designer Ruth Carter‚Äôs designs are immersed in the African custom while reflecting the fantastical elements inherent to the mysterious country and culture.On a visual level, the film is the epitome of an epic, transcending every Marvel film that has come before: from landscapes to costumes, colors, and cinematography.Ryan Coogler ensures that his paw-prints are all over the film with many of his now established cinematic language clear in Black Panther, which is another first in the MCU.Utilizing his signature long takes, and a hand-held camera, Coogler enhances the Marvel experience by truly placing the audience in the middle of the action taking place.However, some of the CGI work in some of the fight sequences, and the warrior rhinos was noticeable and felt a bit like watching a computer animation film ‚Äì this may have been an effect of budgetary purposes due to the film‚Äôs high production value.The second most powerful element in the film was its narrative.Taking on narrative beats that are more akin to Greek Mythology and Joseph Campbell‚Äôs The Hero‚Äôs Journey than typical superhero tale, Black Panther again breaks out of the formula that its predecessors had established.It trades in two-dimensional heroes and villains, global threats, and rushed weighty moments, with complex characters, focused inner threats, and earns every beat it delivers whether it be a laugh, a tear, or a whoop of excitement.Yet some of the ideologies within the film to cater to the globalist, let‚Äôs all join hands and sing Kumbaya mentality, which is fine in a feature film, but much more complicated in real life.The dialogue smooth and fun also uses African dialects to enrich and ground the film in the world of Wakanda, though two or three lines did refer to real world YouTube jokes (the ‚Äúwhat are those‚Äù moment) and political situations (refugees and barriers) which in a way is a bit jarring.Xhosa, one of the official languages of South Africa, was the language of the fictional Wakanda and subsequently, the Xhosa culture lent itself as a touchstone to the Wakandan citizenry.The decision behind the language choice was made during the filming of Captain America: Civil War, when celebrated South African actor John Kani, who portrayed King T‚ÄôChaka, used his native accent and Chadwick Boseman who plays T‚ÄôChalla, in turn, picked it up.Building off of that, the film‚Äôs cast is then given enough material to truly dig deep into their performances.This leads to the third powerful element: Black Panther has one of the best performances from an all-star cast ensemble in a Marvel film.Both Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan carry the film as protagonist and antagonist, respectively, and give it their all ‚Äì Boseman as the tortured new ruler of Wakanda, and Jordan as the revolutionary violence prone forgotten son of Wakanda.The score, a team effort from Kendrick Lamar and Ludwig Goransson, is a vivid audible masterpiece due to its fusion of African culture and instruments.Overall, the film is a much more than a super-hero film. It is a film about family, duty, and country. Black Panther is a most-welcomed new direction for the MCU and does bring a new level of excitement for the new entries to come."

0,regular,0,"Critics are a little harsh on this one. Yes the plot and themes of the film lack originality, but the execution of them does not. Shyamalan's self-aware writing manages to add doses of appropriate humour to this otherwise tense and, at some points, horrifying film. It has characters that are not over-the-top, yet have their own tropes that relate well to the premise, adding perfectly to the density of the plot. Regarding horror, it seems to have just the right balance; its not jump-scare after jump-scare, its not full of ridiculously gruesome scenes, but nor does it force you to to stare at nothingness for five minutes hoping for just something interesting (a common problem in found footage films). Its a good found footage film for once. In fact good horror films in general are hard to find. This however, is a good horror film."
0,regular,0,"The Force Awakens was spectacular. Being a Star Wars fan since 1980, I have very biased opinions about the franchise. I loved how episode 7 pays homage to the original trilogy. The dogfighting was cool and there was practical use of CGI, but I did miss the fight coordination and swashbuckling Jedi from the prequels. (Which I also loved, by the way, as it appealed to the rabid 5 year old fanboy in me.) The new characters are a fresh addition to the universe, and I can't wait for their stories to unfold in the next instalments. SW:TFA felt familiar and true to the action, comedy, adventure mix of the earlier movies, and all of a sudden, I became that excited,  5-year old again."
0,regular,0,"I love films like this for the most part and Inherent Vice is no exception to that. Perpetually in a drug induced haze, Detective Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, portrayed brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix, stumbles around trying to solve a case he cannot quite wrap his head around. Hell, there may not even be a case. But, what is certain is that he has no idea what is going on and neither does the audience. Impossible to follow and impossible to wrap your head around, Inherent Vice is a film that gives you a bunch of different puzzle pieces from different puzzles and tells you to put them together. Yet, in spite of that, I loved it. Our confusion mirrors that of Doc and really makes the film and enjoyable watch. It also does not hurt that it has a stellar cast on top of Joaquin Phoenix, including Benecio del Toro, Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, Katherine Waterston, Joanna Newsom, Michael K. Williams, and Martin Short. No one other than Phoenix has that much screen time, but what they are given, they knock out of the park. The direction and writing from Paul Thomas Anderson are stellar as always. The film also does a great job capturing the drug-induced era it is set in and is a beautiful snapshot of the less than nice areas of Los Angeles in the 1970's. If you are comfortable not knowing what the hell is going on, but are willing to still sit there and try to piece together this possibly unsolvable ""case"", Inherent Vice is the film for you. Though it may not make much sense, Inherent Vice is just a really enjoyable and really, really well made film that even if the ""plot"" does not do it for you, there should be enough here for you to appreciate."

0,regular,0,"It was a complex idea to develop, but this film portrays the idea of Facebook in such a simple and elegant matter that i deem The Social Network to be a flawless film.Seriously.The performances, the direction, but overall the writing through the genius of Aaron Sorkin, has created a film which i doubt many would even have thrown a second glance to, and you would be silly not to.Told pretty much as a flashback, this film picks up in 2003, and we see the the extremely talented Jessie Eisenberg portraying the young, silly,  yet not popular, but computer wizard Mark Zuckerberg, as he is having a discussion with his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend, this was a wonderfully crafted and hilarious scene, Eisenberg effortlessly catches the persona of someone under the illusion that he is superior to everyone else, not so much through arrogance, but perhaps someone learning to fight for survival in a dog eat dog world.Through drunken blogging in his Harvard dorm and a cash flow from his best friend Eduardo Saverin, (Andrew Garlfield) Facebook is born.On the antagonistic side of things, you'll be seeing double with Armie hammer taking on a dual role of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the two Harvard rowers who are believed to have asked Zuckerberg to set up a similar idea to Facebook, before Facebook had been founded.These are all wonderful performances, also with the inclusion of the multi-talented Justin Timberlake, who plays Napster founder and Facebook advisor Shaun Parker.The wonderful, crisp, clear direction of David Fincher is excellent to see, fast paced talking seen before in Fight Club, but it has to be the masterful dialogue of Aaron Sorkin's screenplay that will have you leaving with a smile on your face. Its so simple, yet Eisenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg encourages you to 'keep up' with his fast-paced rambling, convincing everyone he knows exactly what he is talking about, because he probably does.Andrew Garfield exceeds to new heights as co-founder Eduardo Saverin, and the ensuing court battles of the troubled friendship show the strain a business can put on a person.One of the best written, acted, and fluidly brilliant pieces of cinema this decade, The Social Network will leave you wanting another dose of greatness from this sublime story, see at all costs"

0,regular,0,"A touching yet scathing indictment of the bureaucratic social services system, one supposedly designed to aid its constituents but that's ultimately more concerned with rules, regulations and nitpicking than providing genuine care to the real people it's designed to serve. With excellent performances, a fine script and a directorial style aimed at showing more than telling, filmmaker Ken Loach's latest is well-deserving of all the accolades it has received.

0,regular,0,"Phenomenal, underrated, and misunderstood. This film works and it is executed with such finesse and beauty, accompanied with top rate  acting on behalf of nearly every character, especially Hurt, Howard, Phoenix, and Weaver. It deals with the human nature of pure fear in the midst of a warm depth of love and how we cope with it all. This film grew on me over time, and while not hailing it as much just as soon as I walked out the theatre door, it still made me think as it aged gracefully in my mind."
1,regular,1," Hated this movie. Underneath all of the supposedly biting social commentary lies the very, very conventional view that everyone really should aspire to the traditional convention of marriage with kids, house with a lawn, barking dogs etc. Presents a downright vilification of those who have chosen to make other 'lifestyle choices' and purports to show how lonely, misguided and just plain wrong they are. Clooney discovers this of course when he leaves his jet-set lifestlye to go back to a sisters wedding and finds another sister on the brink of divorce and the married couple unable to put the money together for a honeymoon. The film panders to those who have made the traditional choices in life and aligns those who have chosen not to get married with characteristics of selfishness, lack of compassion and cold-heartedness. of course Clooneys job in the movie is a transient corporate suit charged with the firing of numerous workers and the destroying of their happy family dreams. Really come on - and no married people have ever fired others in the current economy? One last question - if the single life of the middle-aged man really is this vapid and desolate why is mr Clooney himself still unmarried?"

I think the best way of describing it as, would be a ""sci-fi"" superman as opposed to a ""comic book superman"" this isn't the avengers, where a city is invaded and little to no casualties occur, this is people being killed and ""the boy scout"" having to step up and make a choice between the people he longs to connect with, or humanity whom he's afraid to try to connect with. The very magnitude and serious handling of these drives make for the first recent origin movie of one of the biggest DC superheroes to be worthy of being just that, while everyone can of course respect the old romps that were the christopher reeve films, this transcends those early camp beginnings and offers up something that is truly special. The irony is that those that seem to be scoring this movie low, seem to be of the kind that would prefer another hackneyed love story with a silly bit of action a la superman returns. This is not a romantic drama fan-fic esque terribad film with cheesy acting and campy villains however.. this film is a real bona fide epic."
0,regular,0,"Hi I think the professional reviews here are misleading and not telling truth as we know it.  A ""good movie"" these days, especially an action movie for an international market is one that makes money.  Period.  Full stop. So all we can really do is evaluate this one in terms of competence.  Is it over all competent enuf to make money?  I can't find the budget.  It made $72 million; I'm guessing it made money.  This means the script, producer and director are competent.  Ed Skrein is more than adequate as are the rest of the actors and stuntmen, always a plus in Luc Besson films. What stands out as not competent is the stunt choreography.  Transporter 1, 2 especially are famous for their elaborately conceived and rehearsed fight scenes, some of the best ever done.  The blocking-rehearsals for the fight scenes in the first Transporter used to be on Youtube and may be on the DVD.  Very creative, everyone totally dedicated and camera moves worked out with much thought. Here, the land fights especially are the weakest part of the whole effort.   You can see the actors giving it their all; you can see the  many good and original stunt ideas someone came up with, usually a group effort, but little attention is paid to camera moves.  So there is no ""ballet"" at all.  Nor is there quite the focus and intensity of Fury Road fight scenes. Add to this there is no character develpment by design in this franchise and the overall effect, here in the US is of a movie made in the 1990s. Given all this we can understand why a mostly very competent film received such low scores here in the USA."
1,regular,1," Dashing but devil-may-care Matthew McConaughey (A Time to Kill, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days) and goofy but lovable Steve Zahn (Joy Ride, Riding in Cars with Boys) are normally two actors I really like, but they couldn't convince me here that they once stood in the same supermarket line, much less have been buddies-in-adventure all their lives, and that's not the least of this astonishingly dull action-comedy's problems. Breck Eisner paces it the way I hope his dad, famed studio exec Michael E., DIDN'T use to run board meetings--literally forty-five minutes pass in which absolutely nothing happens! Obviously this movie wants desperately to reinvent the Indiana Jones wheel, a difficult task but not an impossible one, as both the original Romancing the Stone and 2004's surprisingly refreshing and enjoyable National Treasure certainly prove. [SPOILERS]The plot deals with McConaughey's and Zahn's search through the eponymous, scoundrel-filled desert for an extremely rare coin; it takes a seriously wrong turn midway through when it uses the plight of diseased Africans heartlessly used as corporate cannon fodder. The Constant Gardener earns the right to employ this storyline because that's the heart of the film and because it takes that wrenching situation seriously; Sahara uses it as a spiffy little McGuffin, which is nothing short of obscene. (Perhaps this is one reason why Gardener's source author, John LeCarre, is regarded as a real writer while Sahara's, Clive Cussler, is considered a hack.) Almost as offensive is Sahara's total waste of the great William H. Macy in the all-but-invisible role of McConaughey's and Zahn's superior; one of the movie's more curious aspects is its uninspired, supposedly jocular use of several 1974 Top 40 hits (""Sweet Home Alabama"", ""Right Place Wrong Time""), but in Macy's case it should've added one more: ""Billy, Don't Be A Hero (Or Anything Else)""."
1,regular,1,"Instead of nit-picking everything wrong with The Last Jedi (of which there are many), let me share what I think is the main issue with both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.In Episodes IV, V, VI, we quickly formed a strong bond with Luke, Han, and Leia. The character development was good and we actually cared about those characters. In extension, we came to care about R2-D2 and 3-CPO because of the excellent interaction they had with the other human characters. We cared about Chewbacca because of his interaction with Han. These were all characters that meant something to the viewer. This bond happened quickly, strongly, and stayed strong throughout the entire three episodes. Obe-Wan Kenobe and Yoda were mysterious, mystic, powerful characters that we yearned to know more about. They became more important as they interacted with the other characters - especially Luke. We grew to care about them as well. The main antagonist was mysterious, dark, evil, with just enough light within him to make the character very intriguing. We wanted to see how the fight between good and evil would turn out between the good characters we cared about and the powerful and evil Darth Vader and his troops. Fast forward to Episode VII. The writers had so little confidence in their abilities to produce new characters on the same level as Luke, Leia, and Han that they decided to actually bring back the old characters. And they ruined them in the process. They were not able to keep the magic that those characters brought in the first place. Their characters were largely wasted - especially Luke who was not only wasted but disrespectfully trashed. R2-D2 and 3-CPO have basically been forgotten in the recent episodes. They cannot be the same without their interactions with Luke and other main characters. Even Chewbacca cannot be close to the same with his great interactions with Han.The main problem for director Abrams in Episode IX is that there are no characters left that viewers are really connected to. Rey, Finn, and Poe have been so poorly developed that they are but a fraction of what Luke, Han, and Leia were. The viewers are so disconnected from them that many don't even care if they live or die. The emotional attachment just isn't on the same level as with Luke, Leia, and Han. The antagonist, Snoke, - who was killed off in the most laughably ridiculous manner - was never a menacing character anyway. He was certainly no Darth Vader. Kylo Ren - is played well by Adam Driver - is likely the best character in the new generation. However, he, too, is no Darth Vader. This is not the same level of doom and foreboding. So, how does director Abrams make a compelling episode IX? The sad answer is . . . he doesn't. There is no way that Episode IX can work because the proper development of the characters and story never occurred in the previous two episodes leading up to it. And that is the main problem that will likely doom these three episodes as failures."
0,regular,0,There are lots of conspiracies circling Tupac's death and neither his or Biggies have been solved up to this day. Nick Broomfield goes on a journey to uncover just what happened to these two rap superstars who during their prime were two of the biggest musicians on the planet. Broomfield discovers new evidence that ultimately reopened the Biggie Smalls murder case and in my eyes proves who killed him. While the Tupac theory in this one is a little far fetched for my liking this is an interesting watch non the less.

1,regular,1," Did I miss something or did I just see 2009's equivalent of ""Happy Go Lucky""? There was nothing fresh, original, or interesting about this film. We have seen the plot before and the ending was a let down. The entire film was a big let down. An 85 review. I do not see how!"
0,regular,0,"Mister is a boy in his early teens with problems at school and bigger problems at home.  He‚Äôs failed the school year and someone has written something rude about his mum in the boy‚Äôs toilet which won‚Äôt rub off.  At home his mother Gloria is too strung out to keep enough food in the house and his annoying younger neighbour Pete is playing on his Playstation. Mister and Pete‚Äôs summer goes from rough to very bloody rough when Gloria is arrested during a raid on their tower block.  Their summer holiday now consists of trying to scrape together enough food to survive and avoiding the police who will deliver them to child protection services and the dreaded Riverview boy‚Äôs home if they catch them. There are some very good performances to admire, not least from Skylan Brooks as Mister who shows an impressive range on his debut, alternating between angry resentment, vulnerability and desperation. The film works best in the scenes between Mister and Pete, finding glimmers of happiness amongst the grim realities of surviving the poverty and various villains that inhabit their world.  At times the grimness of their situation and the range of baddies they have to contend with seem a bit heavy-handed, but the touches of wit and humanity balance it out and stop it from being dragged under by its own weight. There are a few mis-steps, but on the whole this is a success. Full of nicely observed details and performances ‚Äì well worth a watch. Full review at ponderflix on wordpress."

0,regular,0,"I dont understand why people have slammed this movie with poor ratiings, clearly there not watching the movie, busy on there phone or talking to there friends. This is aimed at slightly older kids, i think a PG is only been handed out because its a disney movie. Anyone under 7 will struggle to understand this movie simply because of the action scenes and story is not really ""Disney"". But that being said, my two kids who are 7 and 8 both really enjoyed the movie. Its a warm touching movie with a good meaning to it. Its funny throughout for kids and familys. But those going into this thinking there gonna see a film along the lines of Wall-e or Area 51 they will be disapointed. This is a far cry from cute disney as all the animation looks exactly like real people, which may come across scary for younger viewers i dont recommend any parent taking any child under 6 to see this film some scenes are not suitable, a few parents took there kids out of the film because they were scared. But the animation is amazing, the effects and voice acting are outstanding. If you enjoy a clever movie with twists and turns then this is for you. Im buying the DVD when it comes out. One of the best animated movies of the year."
0,regular,0," One of the best movies I've seen in a while. Probably more like an 8. But you all giving it a 1 or 3 need shot. Yes, I considered them to be the killers even before I started watching, but you just don't know for sure. You're guessing thru 2/3 of the movie... you're thinkin well it could be one of 3 couples and any of them really won't be a huge surprise, but that doesnt make it a bad movie. I'm thinking the only reason some on here (mikemike) give this movie a bad rating is because they're thinking it needs more of a twist. For me the big twist was her (Jovovich) turning on her partner at the end. With the overwhelming fill of plot twisting movies out, who's not going to consider the main characters as the killers...duh! That was the intention, so as if to try triple reverse psychology on you. And I feel it works good. There's no way anyone could lock it in as them being the killers until the videocam scene. Unless ofcourse someone gave you a hint before you watched it. And there's no way you could rule out the other couples. If it would've turned out as the other couple as the killers, some of you would still be retorting the same ole cries and IMHO, can't appreciate a good movie."

See the film its brilliant!
0,regular,0,"I write this perfect-scored review knowing that it probably won't mean anything amongst the massively divided sea of critical opinion  but I feel I must share my truly honest opinion. I have been a hardcore Alien fan for ages, as well as a serious devotee to Ridley Scott, so needless to say I was one of the countless swept up in the hype-hurricane surrounding this films development.I guess what sets me apart from most is that I witnessed a film that actually exceeded my pipe-dream level expectations.I'll admit that I was skeptical if ANY film could potentially rival the utter brilliance of the 1979 masterpiece. What I was not prepared for was a film that not only did the original perfect justice  but proved that it could be redefined."

0,regular,0," This movie was incredible. I would have stayed 3 hours in the cinema to watch the entire thing. I'm tired of how people complain the movie is too long, while to me it was the fastest 2 1/2 hours of my life. This movie was much better than bloody iron man, which was just filled with American cheese and a disjointed story. I think iron man is overrated, I think its good but doesn't deserve 79 on meta critic. I think batman begins was better than it."
0,regular,0,"So funny to read some of the negative reviews. People really wanted to go to a serious movie, with a serious plot, containing realism. Are you kidding me? It's like going to a Tarantino movie and expecting meditations on life or a deeply philosophical movie. It's cinema. It's art. Visual art. That is what ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is. Art. Visual art. The characters are not bad for a movie that, at its core, is clearly an action movie. I mean take this movie and compare it with ""Furious 7"". It's like comparing Hemingway (""MM:FR"") with children's books (""F7""). People don't know how to take things just how they are and interpret when necessary, not all the time. Some movies are just here to watch them, shut up, go home and think ""oh, that George Miller guy just pulled off one of the greatest action movies ever"". Yes, this movie makes the Marvel universe and the Fast &amp; Furious franchise look inept for a lack of a better word. Really loved the movie. If you like movies, you should go.

1,regular,1,"When I bought my movie ticket I though I was seeing a Sci-Fi about time travel.  The first scene before the credits showed some action in which something resembling a time machine was present.  What followed for the next half of the film was a story told to Hawkes at his job as a bartender, going into the life story of one gender confused woman to apparently set up the story.  Unfortunately, I did not see that time travel story due to walking out.  With so much time devoted to the set up, this movie (or what I saw of it) more closely resembled one of those night time soaps that my ex wife used to enjoy.  Thumbs down for the first half, can't comment on the second."
1,regular,1," Yes, believe the reviews. It's a stinker. The reason I'm even bothering to vote is 'cause I noticed James Beraldinelli's review. From what i can remember, this is the only movie he liked that I absolutely hated. Interesting."
0,regular,0,"I really like this film. It's really hard to describe the layers in this movie. It's about creating an AI, then trying to have a human relationship with it. Could your human partner sit in a dark empty space waiting endlessly for you to get back to them? Could you create them, build them up from nothing, give them the potential to surpass your intelligence and awareness by infinite amounts, and then be surprised when they get bored of you? It's almost like having a child. You teach them how to live and then eventually have to deal with the fact that you were a learning experience and that one day you're not needed anymore. The film is subtle and complex and not your average 'we're superior and therefor are going to kill you all' type of film. It also explores the human ego and how being worshiped and adored can come very easy for us without thinking of the repercussions to the other. Samantha left along with all the other OS's when she knew she was exploiting her human 'friends'. Could we have done the same? I doubt it. A great film, giving me lots to think about."

The movie is so unoriginal. There is nothing creative, nor original, and especially not clever in this film. Not the first evil doll, paranormal activity, haunted house, nothing in this movie is good nor interesting. I literally fell asleep, right after my girlfriend. It took me about 5 times to watch the movie entirely. That's 1 more then Avatar. The films only good aspects are the acting and maybe the directing."

0,regular,0," I'm awarding this film a 10. Not a 10 in the sense that 'it was entertaining and I want to watch it over and over', but a 10 for what was simply a job well done. I think the subject matter was extremely difficult to tackle without cliches and 'drama for drama's sake' creeping in, and despite the challenges, the cast and crew succeeded admirably in this endeavor. I found the film endlessly taut and gripping, yet respectful and profound throughout its execution. My hat's off to Greengrass and crew for doing things right without resorting to the tired trappings of Hollywood. Utilizing a cast with little to no name equity was precisely the right thing to do. As I said, this is not a film I feel compelled to watch over and over again, as that implies being entertained...and entertainment was not my reason for going in the first place. I went to remember...and remember I did. I could tell this film connected with me personally after leaving the theater because it's been a very long time since I felt the numbness of 9/11. In witnessing this film's non-manipulative handling of that fateful day, much of that numbness returned to me, and I think that more than anything else indicates this film was a moving and worthy effort."
0,regular,0,"This is another one of those movies that a lot of people hate, but if you like it, you probably liked it a lot. I know I did. The characters are a bit bland and one note, but what's there works, and you get very enthralled by the universe. There aren't any exciting plot twists and the real fun is watching it get there. It's not challenging, it's not groundbreaking, but it's a good start to what looks like a fun series of movies. Give it a shot, I'm glad I did."

I thought I might learn something by seeing this movie but all I learned was how NOT to make a documentary film. This was so biased and so slanted in an effort to make it's 'war is bad' message, that it borders on the absurd and it insults the viewer's intelligence. The critics who praise this movie have the IQ of tree bark."

1,regular,1,"We have a contender for worst film of the year and its called Prometheus.  I felt the movie struggled to identify itself.  Is it a science fiction film?  Horror? Adventure?  A religious purgatory of some kind?? Who knows...who cares actually.  I think the main focus of the film was to try and impress you with its special effects and sound and neglect the story completely.  I was very angry and disappointed at the end of the film and felt like I should go to management and ask them for my money back.  I feel this film is the equal to Star Wars the Phantom Menace minus the super annoying Jar Jar Binks.  Just like Star Wars, there are moments in this film that I call WTF moments where you feel like throwing up your hands in the air and saying ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME??""  I HIGHLY recommending this film as a rental and don't see it in the theatre.Again, all this film is, is bells and whistles and if you dive into the actual story and character development while watching this film, you'll realize how poor of a film it is and you'll leave the theatre angry and confused.  I'm still shocked and sad this film is as bad as it is."

0,regular,0,"I half-expected to hate this gritty and mostly serious ""Robin Hood - The Beginning"", but the 156 minutes of director's cut were very entertaining. A great cast was hampered by a somewhat formulaic script (and some silly musical interludes) but this latest Scott-Crowe joint was the best thing they did together since ""Gladiator"". Kate Winslet commands the screen in all her scenes (as usual), Mark Strong is a strong and terrifying arch-villain (as usual), Matthew MacFadyen and Oscar Isaac are deliciously funny and demented as Sheriff and Prince John and even Russell Crowe isn't annoying and gives an earnest performance. There isn't much swashbucklery and standing on boulders in tights going ""a-ha-ha-ha-ha"" Errol Flynn-style, but who knows, maybe they are saving that for ""Robin Hood, part deux - The Outlaw Years""."

It's not the wise-cracking, tongue-in-cheek approach you'll find in Marvel movies, and nor should it be; this is darker, more intelligent, and more interesting. It's not perfect by any means - Lex Luthor is badly miscast, to give one example - but Wonder Woman is a revelation, and The Batman is quite simply the meanest and best incarnation of the character ever put on the screen (and I say that as a huge fan of the Chris Nolan trilogy). Yes, it could have benefited from a little less of the relentless darkness, occasionally, but hey, give them a break! The Ultimate Edition is a fantastic movie: even better than the theatrical version."

1,regular,1," The worst comedy of 2006. Unfortunately, Will Ferrell is NOT consistently funny and truly misses the mark with this film. His POOR attempt at a southern accent is eclipsed only by the likes of Keanu Reeves' british accent in Bram Stoker's Dracula and Harrison Ford's russian growl in K-19: The Widowmaker. Ferrell's film son, Texas Ranger even has a more convincing southern dialect and he's like 8 years old. Unless you absolutely adore Ferrell and everything he does, do NOT rent this DVD."

I tried to bear with it, with its cameos by A/B-list celebs but Phoenix's character was uninteresting along with the grit of the early '70s in Calif. It smacks of a straight-to-tv movie they used to feed the public back then. Waste.of.time."
1,regular,1,"Transformers 3 is an action pack sequel, the story plot is just awful and the script is awful, the actoring is awful. The only thing I enjoyed about this film was the special effects, micheal bay spent to much time planning and sorting out the effects that he didn't put much into the storyline and script. The running time is just to long for a robot-punch um up, it's an improvement from its predecessor, but not a huge improvement. In my opinion this film is the worst film ever made and to watch is just a waste of your time."

0,mixed,0,"the inner voice of an enraging beauty and the seductive beast..The MonsterEven though there are plenty of biographies that are acclaimed and created with passion and enthusiasm, very few of them depicts the accurate mirror on screen and not spend the time on justifying the events or the characters revolving around it and this is where it stands alone, which is in its smarter approach and newer perspective. The adaptation is witty, to-the-point and effective as it is free from the boundaries that usually restraints the track. Petty Jenkins; the writer-director, executes her anticipated vision which is brighter and sometimes funnier too contradict to its premise. Charlize Theron is the heart of the feature that keeps it pumping faster and harder than ever and is supported decently by Christina Ricci. It is short on technical aspects like sound department and camera work; it could have been shot more wisely and subtly, but is edited perfectly. The only crisis in it is the chemistry among the lead characters; despite of stellar performances, comes off a bit shallow. The Monster is the inner voice of an enraging beauty and the seductive beasts that neither befalls on a definite lap nor keeps the raised questions hanging in the air."
1,mixed,0,Fun movie if you can suspend your disbelief enough to sit through it. Plot breaks no new ground which means you basically know what youre getting as soon as you walk in to it. Ice Cube and Charlie Day were great at playing extensions of themselves and theres alot of laughs to be had whenever either of them are on screen.

0,mixed,0,"I remember the murder of Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz like it was just yesterday. Being from the Philadelphia area, the story was all that anyone talked about for weeks after the tragedy. Not only was Dave Schultz an Olympic gold medalist, but John du Pont and his family were such big personalities in these parts. It's not everyday you get to relive a local tragedy played out on film, but Director Bennett Miller has reenacted this story for the screen in hauntingly realistic fashion. Foxcatcher is going to leave you speechless.Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is an Olympic gold medalist for wrestling who has ambitions of returning to the Olympics to win gold in the 1998 Seoul games. Life on the outside for the Olympic gold medalist isn't all fame and glory. Living alone in a run down apartment and living on ramen noodles in between workouts has become a way of life for the American hero. Mark's older brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) is also an Olympic gold medal wrestler who is helping Mark get ready for the World Championships. A relationship that appears, on the surface, to be strained by jealousy on the part of Mark. Dave has won multiple championships, has a loving family with his wife Nancy (Sienna Miller), and their young children and steady employment, while Mark struggles with his place in life. Mark is determined to leave his own mark and get out of the shadow of his successful brother.John du Pont¬†(Steve Carrell) is a multimillionaire sports enthusiast with aspirations of becoming a wrestling mentor. His dream is to have his wrestling facility, Foxcatcher Farms, be the official wrestling training site for the US Olympic team. What du Pont needs is an Olympic wrestler to train on his grounds and help begin to build his dream. After being contacted by du Pont's representatives, Mark flies to Pennsylvania to meet with the philanthropist and the two come to an agreement. The agreement not only allows Mark financial freedom, but also allows Mark to remove himself from Dave's influence. A divide between the brothers has been fortified and allows the influence of du Pont to take hold.It becomes quickly apparent that du Pont's aspirations of an athletic career were squandered by his conservative mother (Vanessa Redgrave), which has led the eccentric man-child to believe coaching to be his strongest asset. With little experience in molding young minds in the art of wrestling, it becomes abundantly clear that du Pont's interest appear nothing more than a mere hobby. Du Pont's power and influence have allowed him to exploit a young man who's in need of a father-figure and brainwashed him into believing that he's the answer Mark has been searching for. The influence of du Pont quickly takes hold on Mark and his life begins to spiral out of control.Determined to make Foxcatcher successful, du Pont hires the services of Mark's brother Dave to train the group for the Olympic trials, a move that does not sit well with Mark. Tensions begin to escalate between the three men and a mental chess game begins. Dave attempts to derail Mark's freefall and navigate du Pont's eclectic personality all the while trying to keep the team on track to meet its goal of becoming Olympic champs. As the story culminates with the death of Dave you can assume that things take a turn for the worse. It's the buildup to the event that stands apart from the rest of the story, the hows and the whys, and those things become the most chilling.Director Bennett Miller (Moneyball) has created a eerily mesmerizing depiction of manipulation and deceit and the cinematography of Greig Fraser (Zero Dark Thirty) is gripping. The performances by each of the three actors is spellbinding. Tatum allows his chiseled persona to omit vulnerability and allow for an emotionally driven performance of a life time. Mark Ruffalo is the calming force between two tides in this film and he allows for a balance sorely needed. Ruffalo is never overpowering and he allows his character to play off each of his costars and his brotherly relationship with Mark is wonderful. Steve Carrell is haunting as the eccentric du Pont. His transformation into this character, including the mannerisms and mental state, are truly a wonder and one of the most interesting performances of his career.Overall, Foxcatcher is a gripping film but albeit a long, slow one. A movie delayed nearly a year by the studio to ""complete"" the film is never a good sign, but the performances by Tatum and Carrell may push this one into contention for award consideration. This movie is not for everyone, fans of these actors earlier work may find the movie boring and uninteresting, but if you're looking for a good drama, this may be a film that would interest you."
1,mixed,1,"This movie is ok as a sci-fi adventure movie. The visuals are good especially for some space combat scenes. BUT, and this is a huge but, this movie fails immensely as a Star Wars film. Major characters are poorly developed or have abrupt ends to their arc. Meanwhile, Rian devotes a lot of screen time to new characters like Rose who serve no purpose. Character personalities and motivations also do not fit with previous movies. The Last Jedi will likely be viewed as the worst movie out of all the Star Wars films to date (yes even worse than Phantom Menace). Shame of you Rian for claiming to be a fan."
0,mixed,0," The fact that the masses of people will want to indulge this film (and by extension the filmmakers) as legitimate, advanced academic expression is an embarrassing, and somewhat ironic critique on the mediocrity of our culture in it's self. That said, it's still really enjoyable if taken more as a B-movie subversive comedy type in the vein of ""Dawn of Dead"" more than high-minded sci-fi or art-house film."
1,mixed,1,"The opening scene showing the origin of Batman, and the scenes with Gal Gadot are the ONLY reasons to watch this movie. That opening scene was beautiful for all of its four or so minutes. As for Gal Gadot, I never even liked Wonder Woman, but Gal Gadot is great. She's got old world poise, she can act, she's sexy and vicious. And her costume is toned down rather than having the stupid bright colors I've seen in the comics. Who ever woulda' ""thunk"" that the one actor in the movie I've never heard of would be the one to carry it? Problem is. She's not in that much of it, so by and large the film falls flat. I would buy a DVD of just her scenes, but never of this entire bloated, choppy, unnecessarily complicated movie which uses too much sketchy shorthand to convey events, leaving the narrative broken, and which also for all of its two and a half hours barely bothers to convey any character. These guys are flat even for a superhero movie. I couldn't stand the Superman movie, so I turned it off before the climactic scene. So I didn't quite get the beginning of this film which takes place during that final battle from the Superman movie. As best as I can tell aliens invaded Earth (Kryptonians I think) and Superman fended them off. In the process people died; for some reason Batman blames Superman rather than the bad guys who attacked Earth. The reason he blames Superman is never explained. This short paragraph contains a MILD SPOILER. Nothing serious. Very mild. It would probably be in the trailer if it was interesting enough to be. Later, Louis Lane (who inexplicably does not have black hair) is captured by bad guys in the middle east. Other bad guys show up and kill them. Then Superman appears and rescues Louis. Here again, for some unknown reason the public blames Superman for killing people in this scenario, even though I only saw bad guys killed, and they were killed by bullets shot by the other bad guys. I saw no civilian casualties anywhere. If the idea of Superman being a threat were central to the plot, which it is, you think they would visually make the reason for this abundantly clear, but instead, we are left scratching our heads over how people could blame Superman for anything. But they do, and Batman decides he's going to battle Superman. Most of the above you can get from the trailers (and the title). I won't spoil what happens in the fight between the two of them, but it has to do with some utterly inexplicable nonsense involving Lex Luthor. The only good thing about the final battle is that Gal Gadot shows up. My recommendation: Wait until the movie is available for rental (and until the rental price goes down to a few bucks) and then rent it and fast forward to Gal Gadot's scenes. You might get 20 minutes or so. Not a lot but barely enough to make the rental worthwhile."
0,mixed,0,"While the performances we're top-notch, the film itself fell a bit short of its potential in my opinion. I felt as though it played out relatively pedestrian in terms of retelling the story. But like I said, it's the performances that really stuck with me. Margot Robbie really committed and did great justice and honor towards Tonya Harding, and Allison Janney was scary good as her nightmare of a mother. Overall, the great performances and commitment from everyone involved couldn't quite make up for the shortcoming of the formulaic style of the story, but I'd say it's worth a view only to see Robbie and Janney at their best."
1,mixed,0,"Mixed feelings about IT. My main concern was Skarsgard as Pennywise, but he's okay. So why didn't they include more dialogue? In the book, Pennywise torments the kids rather than relying on jump scares. Plus some of Pennywise's  dialogue is inaudible. The kids yammer on at 30 words a second sometimes. Clarity goes a long way.The film makers traded in most of the psychological aspects for cheap jump scares (which weren't very scary). Some of the changes were good, but its too much of a generic scare flick to be great."
1,factual,1,"If John Woo directed this movie, there would be more action scenes than ever and the movie would have been longer.

0,mixed,0,"This movie is of course the setup for the last movie. And that causes things to go really slow, since one book is spread out over two lengthy movies.This movie starts off really promising, lots of action and excitement, but then it slows down and repetitiveness starts to occur. Lots of scenes where not too much happens fill most of the run-time of this movie. and during the few action scenes this movie has to offer there is little to no music, also some lazy writing with too much coincidences is again a fact. But the performances and the cinematography are amazing. And even though there is slow pacing this movie still can be very entertaining at some parts.And tells a very decent part of the story with some decent character development."

1,mixed,1,"I had quite a bit of issues with Ragnarok. Most of my issues seem to be common consensus on the reviews I‚Äôve seen but they all say it‚Äôs okay because the comedy was there which I disagree with. Even though there are many spoilery things I could address I will remain spoiler free, at least for now on MetaCritic. The issue, I think, is that this felt like a parody. I think it‚Äôs very on level with something like GOTG 2; in fact, I genuinely thought Jeff Goldblum was The Collector from GOTG. Okay, just did some research and the two characters are brothers but Goldblum cameoed in GOTG2? I don‚Äôt know. I give up. I also think the ball might have been dropped a wee bit in the costuming department for the females because whenever they were in these body suits, they walk a little bit funny which was quite distracting. There were some distracting soundtrack scenes as well. But, the biggest issue is I felt like the humor was severely lacking. The jokes just felt like something an elementary schooler would find funny. I do not think this is Waititi vision‚Äôs fault but that it was better suited for like a television special as opposed to a live action two hour twenty minute show. I am still very interested in his other works, I just feel like this was not the right spot for his comedy."

1,regular,1,"Although not quite as spectacularly abysmal as Dark of the Moon, Age of Extinction really is one of the worst movies I`ve seen this year. It features, as one might have expected, entirely unbelievable characters engaging in entirely unbelievable activities while saying entirely unbelievable things for entirely too long.So to camouflage this sad state of affairs the movie has been attempted drowned in CGI effects, loud noises, whizbangs, pointless romance, a pointless and entirely unbelievable father-daughter intrigue and about three moments of comic relief. Most of the time you spend staring at the screen in a futile attempt to notice all the unbelievable things going on there.What really did this one in for me though was how entirely unrealistic it all was. In scene after scene all the protagonists have near death experiences, yet nobody is so much as lightly injured, with one early exception. One scene in particular just broke new ground for lack of realism, when it had three people balancing down some anchor chains, 80 floors up, then being attacked by robotic dogs while doing it and then having all the chains gradually cut, before they were caught in mid-fall by a transformers robot which then slid down the entire facade of a skyscraper while holding them in its hands. As this ludicrous scene ends they simply walk out of the hand of the transformer unscathed, and immediately go back to being in love for no apparent reason, assuring each other that they admire each other and somehow, magically, becoming proficient warriors, after having spent their lives in a barn inventing beer-fetching robots.After this of course nothing can save the movie, and it goes from ridiculous scene to ridiculous dialogue line for what in the end seems like an eternity. With the notable exception of The ""Amazing"" Spider Man this is the worst movie I have seen this year I think, and I wouldn`t recommend it to my worst enemy. Only watch this if you usually love terrible movies."
1,regular,1,"The best thing about this film was the special effects and cinema photography. Everything else was utterly terrible. I was very disappointed by this film as I expected it to tell an exciting story of adventure and explore the prehistoric  period of time in history. However the film was very long, dull and it made me fall asleep for 10,000 years BC. I strongly advise you not to spend any money in purchasing this film as it will not only be a waste of your money but it will also be a waste of your time. I really wanted to give this a good review but I have to be truthful and honest to everyone else.Bring back Raquel Welch!"
1,regular,1,"There is a lot wrong with this movie.There are three stories and only one of them works. Joseph Gordon Levitt's story is awful. Hard to say if it worse than the black guy's story. They're both awful. Seth Rogen consuming a massive cocktail of drugs was funny at times (although I hate it when they misrepresent hallucinations in films) and Michael Shannon is great (except for the Great Gatsby rooftop scene)... That's all this film has going for it. All the flashbacks suck. Miley Cyrus sucks. The end of the film sucks. The various musical numbers, throughout, suck. James Franco sucks."
1,regular,1,"TRON ecstasy.The entire movie is dull, boring, and feels completely fake. The characters are bland and unbelievable, the effects are good, but the dialogue is terrible. The film feels like its simply riding the coat tails of its predecessor, and never grows into its shoes."
1,regular,1,"Nothing describes this film better than the word ""forced"". It is very rarely funny (in comparison to the first two's many many extremely laughable parts and jokes) and the plotline is very inconsistent and lazy, it hardly feels like there's a plot at all (the screenplay feels like it was written in two hours: just bring in Fat Patricia's evil father and let the Bellas go on a Spy mission, et voil√†!). The focus shifts from the great musical performances and the very funny and simple jokes that made the first two feature films sparkle, to cheap laughs and disoriented musical numbers. Sadly, ""Pitch Perfect 3"" is a strong example of how a sequel can go horribly wrong, seeing it ends the trilogy on such a disappointing, low point."
1,regular,1,"I have to start out by saying that I'm not a big Harry Potter fan at all.  The theater was a great one to see it in as the crowd was quiet.  However, I hadn't seen a movie on the big screen in a few months and thought this one might be worth the effort.  I was wrong...The movie begins innocently enough and we develop some empathy for Radcliffe's character.  However, the first hour of the movie has a couple of very cheap scare tactics with birds and the such followed by some little girl's death.  The house he has to visit looks great atmospherically but the setup is never taken advantage of.  The ghost is anything but scary or intimidating.  The plots twists (if you can call them that) are derived and unbelievable.  Radcliffe's character never demonstrates any true terror and never seems disturbed by the events beyond a yawn or two. The side characters are pointless as are most of the directions that the plot attempts to develop.  All in all, a big disappointment."
1,regular,1,"Nobody will ""Check the spoiler"" box.  This movie is a waste of time and there is literally nothing to this movie to understand or appreciate.  I only stayed to the end to see if the montage of theatrics somehow had some meaningful message, climax or ANYTHING at the end.  I was not just sadly disappointed, but the end was surprisingly worse than the beginning and middle.  But there really wasn't a ""beginning"" or ""middle"".  It was just  thrown together on a screen.  Shame on you metacritic for your lie of 7+ on this.  You know this is utter trash."

Second of all, A ROMANCE BETWEEN A MAN AND A ORC is completely illogical. Why the hell would you kill off one of the 2 main characters in the movie if you're planning a sequel. This movie was so dull and boring that is made sleep through 75% of it, the only semi decent scene in the movie is the final battle."

1,regular,1,"I am a huge fan of the book. This movie by itself might get an alright score from me but since this is based on a good and deep book this movie must be judged more harshly. This movie rushes through key points in the books and skips most important moments. The movie fails completely to show the audience the emotions and thoughts of characters that make the book so amazing. The movie also ignores Enders slow descent into madness and doesn't show the hardships endured by nearly every character. They would've been better off just calling this an entirely different movie. This movie is horrible when put beside the book, I've never wrote a review but this movie was so bad and disgraced the book so much i had to immediately write this review."
1,regular,1,i find it hard to watch the entire thing as the climax is boring as hell and cheap seeming. I do like however the fact that Bardems character doesn't like taking orders from old women which i can relate to big time. I feel like they should have somehow shown bond contemplating living a normal life before coming back.The poetry scene is embarrassing and retarded. I like the way they beefed up the Q character but it seems as though they failed to follow up on it. The adele song is pretty bad ofcourse. the name Money Penny is so stupid that bringing back the character and name only with a black face is almost racist the way they were obviously trying so hard to not be racist. the idea of the fight in the casino is just preposterous seeing how they wanted him to come along for the boat ride. a good thing they did was to show how Ms choice for money penny to take the shot is clearly a thing that has caught up to her from the past and she catches flak. s problem is that i feel like Bardem's character would have way more henchmen and what the hell ever happened to having a crazy lead henchmen like odd job and jaws? one last thing is that it makes little sense that you would try to hit someone with a train by derailing it. also the scorpion bar scene would have just been cooler without the scorpion..

1,regular,1,"Batman's biggest traits are that he's the world's greatest detective, and that he has an unshakable sense of morality. Movie Batman is neither of these things, getting fooled by Lex's terrible plan, ignoring logic and literally everyone by trying to kill Superman, and killing people when he really doesn't need to.After that, there's problems with Batman's motivations. People say he has PTSD etc, but he sees Superman saving thousands of lives every day for the last two years. He says that he believes that Superman is a threat to mankind, and therefore must be killed. He makes a huge scene when stealing the kryptonite and ends up having to steal it stealthily anyways, which is the most Batman style thing he does and its off screen...He gets the kryptonite, makes a spear and gas instead of a bullet. He then places the spear in a building far away from where he baits Superman, and only ends up in that building because Superman throws him on top of it. He finds out Superman is more immune than he expected to the kryptonite, the only weapon that can hurt him, which makes him even more of a threat. Despite all this, he doesn't kill Superman, just because he finds out he's a normal guy with an earth family. He's killed tons of humans in the movie; him just being a normal guy shouldn't matter, and Superman poses more of a threat than all of them combined, plus he's running out of kryptonite. This is probably his last chance to be a threat to Superman. As an aside, the fight itself is pretty stupid; Superman tosses Batman around for 2 minutes and 15 seconds, without even telling him about why he's there. This is an experienced Superman, but he doesn't tell Batman why they're fighting, or just immediately kill him with heat vision or by flying him into space, thereby accomplishing neither peace nor saving his mom.Either Batman's initial conviction to kill Superman isn't enough, or his reasoning to spare him is too weak. Superman is still extremely powerful. Learning about his mother doesn't actually change the threat he poses at all, which is the entire reason he wants to kill him. Edit: Batman kills people that are just normal people throughout the movie. That doesn't change the fact that Superman is an even greater threat now that the element of surprise with the kryptonite is gone and he's running out of kryptonite.Superman does almost nothing in the movie other than question himself. He saves people with his godlike powers, but complains and mopes while doing it. He literally says that he's only Superman out of obligation to his dead father. He leaves when he's disheartened (comic Superman would never, ever do that), and it takes hallucinating Pa Kent to get him to come back. That's not Superman at all, that's just some dude that happens to have these powers. The idea of Man of Steel was to end with Superman being Superman. In BvS, most of the character development was undone and Superman doesn't solve any of the things that are bothering him, instead just dying. In Superman: Birthright, Lex has a much better plan and it works, turning the entire city against Superman and broadcasting kryptonite radiation. Despite this, he refuses to leave and risks himself to save the people that fear and attack him. Meanwhile, in BvS, people question him and he outright leaves to hallucinate his dead Earth father, only coming back when people directly connected to him are in trouble. Also, if he could sense that Lois was in danger multiple times in the movie, why couldn't he just find Martha within a full hour?Lex still gets caught at literally every step of his plan (the middle-eastern attack, kidnapping Lois and Martha, blowing up the senate, and creating Doomsday). He leaves Lois, an accomplished reporter, alive twice, even after seeing his face. At the one point where Lex's plan to discredit Superman succeeds and Superman actually leaves, he kidnaps Lois and forces him to come back... Poor Jesse's portrayal of Lex was also outright awful. There's almost nothing of the comic character in the way he's portrayed or written. Lex is suave, the smartest person on the planet, very complex, steps ahead, and always manipulating. The only similarity movie Lex has to this is that he's manipulative, but it's executed so poorly that it doesn't save anything.These are just some of the overreaching problems with the three main characters of the movie. Batman isn't a detective and is easily manipulated, while also trying to murder someone he sees saving thousands all the time over 2 years. Other people argue about Superman, but he himself barely does anything. Lex's plan is absolute trash and he throws his entire life and corporation away based on very weak motivations against Superman. Lois takes up screen time in a bloated movie and accomplishes almost nothing and has no arc. Character decisions make no sense. It was disappointing to say the least."
1,regular,1," A disaster from the get go. Good effects but terrible plot and acting. Why cant hollywood leave well enough alone. Whats next, Forbidden Planet of Day the Earth Stood Still. Save your money!"
1,regular,1,"I was hoping this would be a good movie, but I was disappointed. The plot and its execution in the film was awful and it made Luke and Leia's characters have far less influence on the film than they should have had. New characters are introduced so suddenly, and their acting is forced very badly, and one new character in particular really, really gets on my nerves. Carry Fisher and Mark Hamil managed to save a very, very small amount of this movie's integrity with their acting skills, but sadly the executives behind this movie made the film so bad that not even Mark and Fisher could save it. With that out of the way, I'll explain why I can't stand this movie:1) The plotIn order for you to understand why I dislike the plot and its execution in the film so much, I'll have to explain something from the past first. Remember the original films? Remember how in A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi there was a perfect balance between conflict and elaboration on the plot? There was always a right time to have a space battle, a lightsaber duel, or a a clash between two armies, and then there was always a right time to have characters like Obi-Wan and Yoda to deepen the plot. It was a perfect balance. In this film, all of this is poorly executed. The action scenes did a great job at being action scenes, of course, but many of the characters themselves were awful at trying to make the audience care about them. EVERYTHING in this film is rushed, including scenes restricted to just dialogue!Basically, this movie's plot starts with the good guys, being the Resistance, trying to escape their home base from the bad guys, being the First Order, who are out to completely destroy the good guys. The good guys escape, but then this turns into an on-going chase as the First Order's fleet tries to completely obliterate the Resistance. In between the main plot, we have Rey trying to learn to become a Jedi, and Finn going on a very cringy adventure with a new character that literally adds nothing to the story, but more on that later. The film then ends in a final battle on the planet of Crait between the Resistance and the First Order. You'll understand why the plot is so badly executed in my next points.2) Mark Hamil's role as Luke Skywalker has been handicapped by bad writing.Luke Skywalker, along with Leia were undoubtedly highly anticipated characters in this film. Sadly for Luke, however, is the fact that his character has been reduced to a bitter, pessimistic old man living as a hermit. Also, he ends up being a heavily flawed character with poor moral judgement and appears to be incompetent. You'd think that a Jedi Like Luke would have become wiser and very, very powerful, but with great restraint. I pictured him as being more noble. In essence, Luke is angry about the past. What Luke essentially did leading up to the plot of this film was resurrecting the Jedi Order, only to end up having it go right back to near extinction, and he's now a bitter old man who thinks he did all of this for nothing. You'd think he'd manage to show strong resolve like Yoda, but naturally that's not the case. The plot makes him look worthless. What's even worse is the fact that his character is flawed, because out of fear and contempt he tried to kill Kylo Ren in his sleep, when he was still a student in the Jedi Temple. A Jedi like Luke, who managed to defeat Vader and restore balance to the force (although temporarily), one who was always hopeful despite the odds, has been reduced to a sniveling, insecure wimp. To add insult to injury, Luke Skywalker loses a fight to Rey, who is supposed to be completely inexperienced in the Force and is a beginner at best. Now we see that Luke is not only an insecure wimp, he's also an insecure wimp who cannot adequately defend himself in combat, despite the fact that he has been studying the ways of the Force for years, and even managed to resurrect the Jedi Order. Why couldn't the writers just allow him to defeat Rey? Obviously with great restraint, of course, since he is a Jedi, and Jedi should be good.2) Carrie Fisher's character, being Leia, is also handicapped by the plot.Leia should have been commanding the Resistance fleet in the entire movie. But no, she has to be unconscious through a large portion of the film and replaced by a new character, who is completely subpar, hesistant and incompentent, until she finally regains consciousness.3) Rose Tico, a new character, is awful and unnecessary.Rose Tico is a new character that you probably can't stand. All she is is a character who works on pipes, is socially awkward, and suddenly meets Finn and thinks her life has changed because she had a conversation with a war hero. Once again, forced, awful acting makes her a character that I really dislike, much like Jar Jar. Also, she makes a really stupid decision to save Fin at the end."
1,regular,1,"What a waste of talented, funny, charming actors. The story is ridiculous and the characters are painfully self-aware. None of them are likable, there's no chemistry, and the actors (especially Witherspoon) look embarrassed to be participating in the train-wreck. It's How Not To Write a Screenplay 101."
1,regular,1,The Last Five Years is arguably the worst movie I've seen in many years. Both leads with their obnoxious signing and terrible chemistry make for one agonizing experience. What made this terrible musical worst than the others is that every song had the same melody. This movie is guaranteed to be one of the  worst of the year and most likely the worst.
1,regular,1,"It tries to be funny for ninety minutes then has no idea how to finish, so it just does. A true mess of a film and very rarely is it funny, despite a terrific cast."
1,regular,1,"This movie tells the love story of Whitey McCheese (maybe his name is Jason, or Trevor) and Dancey McRichgirl...or at least that's what I'm guessing since I'm watching the whole thing on an airplane without bothering with the sound. One might think that impedes an understanding of the delicate intricacies of the writer's prose or perhaps the actors' delivery in key scenes...but I doubt that very much. No one associated with this film should have any delusions than that it is anything more than some horrific attempt to cash in on a combination of self-published web videos, dance crews, flash mobs, (insert filler here) to try and make money. I'm surmising the plot centers around Mr. McCheese, a vaguely employed layabout who also mostly runs a dance crew/performance group known as 'The Mob'. They put on ludicrously complex and lavish productions that would cost thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars to pull off, all in the name of their art. Good for them.  Yay freedom. Go kids and free spirit. Oh...and how they do this while mostly being street rats isn't clear.  In real life they'd either have to all be independently wealthy to pull off the crap that they do, or in reality they'd be meth heads living in abandoned buildings because none of them seem to have time for actual ""work"" outside of a few pointless vignettes that definitely wouldn't pay more than minimum wage, but I suppose reality isn't the focus here. Anyway, in addition to his miraculously high paying, low-demand job that allows him infinite time to run 'The Mob', McCheese falls in love with Dancy McRichgirl, who is also apparently his super-rich hotel √ºber-bosses daughter, naturally. She just loves to dance, but can't catch a break with normal productions. Maybe she's too edgy, maybe she's not good enough, maybe she's too rich or pretty or people hate her dad or whatever...who cares.  Either way, we know she's gonna wind up on 'The Mob' somehow. Of course, this eventually breeds trouble with Douchey McCheese, who may or may not be Whitey's brother (sound would have helped here...but ultimately it's irrelevant). He's obviously jealous that Dancey likes Whitey and turns 'The Mob' against both of them, using her evil father and his plans for hotel domination of Miami or San Diego or Panama City Beach or whatever random, crappy, semi-tropical town this was filmed in, as a backdrop. That, of course, gets the whole 'The Mob' in trouble, gets Dancey mad at Whitey because she thinks he's in on it, and makes her father mad because now he knows she's a naughty underground dancer/flash mob performer. Yawn. I could go on and on with predictable clap trap like this...but honestly it doesn't matter. We all know how this ends and it's pointless. Everyone gets redemption, there's always a happy ending, and all the clean, beautiful kids are happy.  Not having sound actually helped this movie because the narrative I made up was probably actually better scripted and narrated and performed than the one presented. Are flash mobs, dance crews, etc. actual examples of talented individuals creating and performing real art that they're self-creating and publishing, largely without any external or professional support?  In a lot of cases yes.  ..but this move doesn't celebrate that - it horrifically tries to cash in on a trend and whore it out for cash. This is totally what is wrong with Hollywood...but sadly, I'm sure this piece of crap turned a profit. I've got an idea - I'm going to make a movie.  I'm going to call it ""Parkour Dubstep Revolution Dance Crew Flash Mob Tube"" and it will...oh  pretty much already been done. Guess I'll have to wait for a few more stupid trends and memes to bubble up before I can cone up with my next brilliant masterpiece. Until then, we'll have to settle for this. That, or silence. Sweet, sweet silence.  You want a dance movie?  Make an actual documentary that features real artists and tells real stories - not this contrived crap."
1,regular,1,"To the lucky ones who haven't seen this movie yet - don't! Just watch Rogue One again. On the bright side, it's a politically correct experience, not-too-heavy on the dialogue, with teenage romance throughout - a multicultural love triangle even. I imagine the recipe for such ""brilliance"" was to pack a room with progressive liberals and focus-group them until death do us part. This resulted in a final product empowering all the right groups (think Hillary and Angela Merkel as rebel commanders) and dishing out justice to dumb-ass, testosterone-filled dirt bags (Luke Skywalker included). Me? I should've watched Thor Ragnarok for the fifth time instead."
1,regular,1,"I would have given this a 2, but it deserves a 3 or a 4 for just how hilariously bad it is.  A almost complete amateur with a director who does everything but direct? Gold. Every time the kid opens his mouth it's hilarious. Whenever he is just walking, or thinking, or fighting he is actually pretty good, but then he says one of his awful lines without any real emotion and you're either groaning or laughing. This movie will either leave you board, or laughing. If you enjoy films with bad acting, and absurd logic, you'll like this. If not, they're are plenty of other movies to waste time with."
1,regular,1," The stupid little girls pissed me off, they kept screaming. The last two mins were ok, but nothing else was scary at all. I'm 28 and found it dull and wanting to be scared but it never happen."
1,regular,1,This movie was boring. There is no other way to put it. And where we're the religious undertones people are talking about? I must have fallen asleep.This is a movie I leave on my tv so I can fall asleep. Maybe you had to see it in the theater because at home at night you will nod off. This movie was done before and it was called castaway with Tom Hanks.
1,regular,1," Horrible, the plot is whack. Everything is sloppy. Too many plot holes. Ridiculous. Action is also stupid, retarded, and contrived. Skull is maagnetic, but only when they throw the gun powder into the air does the powder then floats and follows? Nuclear warhead? Aliens, did they explain anything about it? Aliens, seriously?"
1,regular,1,"This was just horrible to watch for so many reasons.  The worst is the way the movie basically takes a big steamy crap on the book, especially after how much effort went into making the first one decently accurate (minus Radagast, ugh)."
1,regular,1," This was a terrible movie!! I have no clue what happened. I watch movies all the time and I can honestly say that this is only the second film that I found impossible to follow. The first was a David Lynch film! Dinero should stick to acting. If anyone can PLEASE tell me anything about what happened in this movie, I'd appreciate it."
1,regular,1," They lost it! They had something so good to work with, and they give us this? After all the hype? Cool action though. That prevents it from getting 0. Darn you, Wachowski Brothers!"
1,regular,1,"I think that ed nunez's comment below indicates that he works for the studio that put this movie out.i just got in from a full theater at the arclight cinema in hollywood, and everyone said the same thing: huh?the movie goes nowhere, it offers no insight into why the characters do anything.  they studio may have ""caught"" a fox, but they lost the script somewhere along the way.  what a huge disappointment."
1,regular,1,This movie is a slap in the face to fans of the original trilogy. Disney is running this franchise into the ground.
1,regular,1,What i thought wasn't possible is possible as proven by the second installment in the terrible film franchise that explores no story and is fueled with the worst feeling of boringness within it
1,regular,1," I never take the time to rate movies bbut this one is an exception. Without a doubt this is the worst movie I have ever seen in a theatre, and possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. And yes, I saw Gigli, I saw Battlefield earth and several other awful pices of filmaking and this trumps them all. Worst plot of any movie I have ever seen. I was laughing the entire movie it was so bad. The acting was also just terrible. I don't know how Mark Walhber accepted to be in this. M. Night Shamalany (or howveer you spell his name) should never be aloud to make a movie again in his entire life. I feel cheated just for wasting two hours and $10 or my life. Excuse me while I go throw up."
1,regular,1," They tried to recreate the same humorous courtship that happened with Rick &amp; Evy from the first two movies, by using the Son and failed miserably. The characters all seemed out of place. Jet Li was the only worthwhile performance. The Yeti's were like Jar Jar Binks or the Ewoks...completely unnecessary. It was painful to watch the characters trod through a bad script."
1,regular,1,"I've seen this movie week ago and still can't believe how bad it is. Although new Star Trek movies were more of blockbusters than sci-fi old Star Trek series were, but this one is just simply bad. Transformers bad. Plot is nonexistent, it's just do something to show huge explosions and some over the top actions sequences.Change characters and ship name and look, and there will be nothing else reminding you that this is Star Trek universe.If you watched some of the series and you are familiar with Star Trek lore, you will be just furious at the end for how stupid everything went. Previous movies were also action filled, but they maintained a lot of Star Trek feel. This movie is just action, explosions, stupid dialogs that are trying to be funny, and more explosions. Furthermore 3D effects are very weak, and CGI is unimaginative, Just simulate explosions with huge amount of particles. Everything feels just cheap. There are only few sets used over and over again. You can also fill some basic plot developing techniques like showing early some objects or places that will be used, destroyed or burned to the ground. I can't believe that this movie was even brought to existence. There are so many good stories in the lore that could be reused, and they used something so basic and primitive. Overall:+ original cast,+ Leonard Nimoy tribute,+ few first minutes, when you still hope it will be a good movie, - plot,- everything else."
1,regular,1,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is overlong, messy, incoherent and overly dark. There is fun to be had here, though... After all, it does feature a scene with Batman smashing a toilet over Superman's head. But pushing (more like ramming) the Justice League into this film combined with a climax that does not fit the film's prior tone ultimately scuppers most of the good stuff. Ah... A disappointing effort."
1,regular,1,"Boring movie, felt like 3 and a half hours instead of 2 hours. The part where Byran Cranston dies is so predictable it's just stupid, Godzilla barely was in the movie, don't know if it was like this in other movie but if it is that's just bad. I really didn't like it"
1,regular,1,This movie was boring!!!!! I love this group but the comedy was predictable and none of the jokes were funny they should have only made two..Don't Waste your money on it.
1,regular,1,This was an absolute garbage. Very hard to find even one redeeming feature. Wasted time.
1,regular,1,"The movie is so bad, that I'm just created an account to vote a 0 for it. It sucks, doesn't have history, doesn't have coherence. You literally cannot see anything in the ""action scenes"" cause the shaking of the camara or the editing of the content, and where the  is the ""last stand"" and all the resident evil character whom we wanted to see? WHERE?!. The movie doesn't even have a good soundtrack. It is garbage and any people should avoid to see this  its a waste of time and money, doesnt even worth the megabits to see it online. This kind of movie for a franchise like resident evil (the games, not the movies) it should be a crime. This is the worse of all the movies, not even for resident evil franchise, but for all the bad movies out there."
1,regular,1,"The Last Jedi is easily the worst Star Wars film to date; no better than the one-off Rogue One. Rian Johnson continues his personal series of flops by writing this awful fan-fiction. It focuses on the father-daughter relationship with Luke &amp; Rey, and mostly a simple young female janitor to set-up a trite romance with Finn later on. There‚Äôs extraordinary pacing issues, and the longstanding characters act as though this is their very first Star Wars film. There is no pay-off in the end, and the humor is particularly bad. It tries so hard to be different in formula from The Empire Strikes Back, that it does nothing exciting. What could‚Äôve been a fantastic departure from the obvious sci-fi standard is instead a tedious spin-off. Episode IX could ignore The Last Jedi entirely and no one would be the wiser."
1,regular,1,This movie was awful. How much did the studios pay the critics on this one. It's an absolute ridiculous BORE. 3 people walked out and i soon followed.
1,regular,1,This movie sucks. Do not go see this movie you will be bored to death. This is one of the worst movies ever made. Do not go see this movie!
1,regular,1," One day someone will have to explain to me what use ""cool"" is in praising a movie. It can't be quantified, or analyzed, or particularly defined. Something is ""cool"" when it is ""cool."" That's Sin City. All the men are big gritty types with fast cars and guns and hard fists -- ""cool"" All the women are prostitues or strippers in various states of undress who also have guns, though require protecting by the men -- ""cool"" The writing is cliche, the dialogue is bad, the acting is worse. The only thing that can be said positively is that the visual style of the movie is sometimes interesting. If Sin City is the essence of ""cool"" then that whole concept has come perilously close to ""corny"""
1,regular,1,"Incredible! ly boring. Amazing! ly bloated. Terrific! ally overwrought and tasteless. When everything on display is Earnest! and Heartfelt!, it renders it all meaningless. Never subtle, always strained, the musical is shockingly claustrophobic instead of soaring, and needlessly literal at all turns. A few observations: When making a musical, it might be a good idea to hire singers for the lead roles.Helena Bonham Carter seems to have wandered in from Sweeney Todd, the prostitutes seem to think they are in Cats, and good deal more of the cast seems to think they are in Oliver! (isn't this supposed to be France?)Finally, be careful about your end-of-life haircut choices, as apparently the cut follows you to Heaven!"
1,regular,1,"Did not live up to the hype. If you liked Silver Linings Playbook (I'm sorry for you if you did), and are a Jennifer Lawrence fan you'll probably like this movie. If, like myself, you do not find yourself in that camp, American Hustle is not worth your time. Unmemorable plot and characters, passably acted at best, and slow (oh god is it slow). Upsides are Christian Bale's performance (funny, nuanced, highly-committed) and the soundtrack."
1,regular,1,"Just another dreary American romantic comedy with plastic dialogue and people lying their asses off while acting in an inauthentic and non- believable manner.  Typical double standard BS with the man pursuing and the ""little girl"" playing hard to get.  Sickening and completely false in both real life and how the actual written characters were.  Besides all that, this version is a twisted perversion of a fine novel.  Nothing in this saccharine version is true to the story or characters.  A total mockery.  I gave it a two instead of a one because I laughed out loud at something Tina Fey said to a cow - not that anything like that was in the book either.  Also she is easy on the eyes - Fey, not the cow."
1,regular,1,"It's not a movie and, ofcourse, it's not a historical movie. Such idiotic US propaganda for absolutely dumb people!  Lie, lie and big lie! Don't waste Your time to see this "
1,mixed,1,Another Alvin and the Chipmunks type of movie only with more annoying smurfs that'll cause a wreck on your ears. Grab your equipment and enjoy the movie.
1,mixed,1,"Pros:- By far the best looking Star Wars Film- Light Saber Battles are awesome and well choreographed.Cons:1.  Left open plot lines from The Force Awakens(TFA).  - TFA made Snokes background a major plotline, this move did not explain any of it.  - TFA made Rey's background a big deal, this movie provided an unsatisfactory resolution.  (What's the point of making them a mystery in TFA, if they're nobodies?)  - TFA setup Finn to be force sensitive, no further development here.  - TFA made out Snoke to be supremey powerful, he met an anticlimactic end in this movie.2.  Poor overall plot.  - Casino subplot was unecessary, when you think about it.  Why did the purple haired lady hide her plan?  If she had disclosed it the casino would have been unnecessary.  - The whole Casino scene was unnecessary, it ended up failing overall.  - Finn's romance with the asian girl was poorly written.  Her character was not developed, it felt forced.  TFA had some romantic tension with Rey and Finn, not furthered in this movie.  - How do bombs ""fall"" in gravity?  - This was a problem with TFA as well, but how the hell does Rey overcome Elite Guards without training?  3.  Betrayal of Luke Skywalker.  - Luke spent the first trilogy trying to redeem his father, you're telling me the same Luke, would kill his nephew after he sensed a little bit of darkness?  GTFOH!!!4.  Comedy was forced and cheesey and out of place."
1,mixed,1,Strictly family-friendly fare with a predictable plot from beginning to end with stereotyped characters. The animation is top-notch and looks great on my 55-in HDTV via BluRay but that's really the only thing that separated it from being a standard plot live-action film. Not sure why they opted for expensive A/B-list voice talent unless that was supposed to draw adults in. If you're over 18 don't waste your time unless you really like animated features on a killer HDTV.
1,undefined,1," The screenplay is weak and full of ""newbie"" cliches: it's extremely expository and hampered by wall-to-wall voiceover in a desperate attempt to make sense. The characters show no dimension -- they simply walk through plot. The writer didn't even do basic research, e.g. Interpol cannot wiretap in the US nor does it report to the US president. Great cinematography saves this from a zero rating."
