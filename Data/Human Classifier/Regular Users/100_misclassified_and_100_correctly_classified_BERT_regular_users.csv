0,regular,0,"Little Boy is charming and interesting and is a well-shot film overall the film has commonplace characters, a  terrible religious message, cliche's and it's offensive. The acting is okay, the actors give what is expected of them nothing special. An auto mechanic is sent James Busbee (Michael Rapaport) is sent to Japan to fight the Japanese during World War II, leaving his wife (Emily Watson) two sons London (David Henrie) Pepper (Jakob Salvati). Pepper feels upset without his father by his side, so he can't wait for him to return. His favorite magician Ben Eagle (Ben Chaplin) and priest (Tom Wilkinson) convince him to bring his dad home. The filmmakers want to make a story but they failed to make the story good overall they just made a silly mess. Grade B-"

1,regular,1,"A faux-silent film without anything of interest except some beautiful cinematography and some nice locations in Bulgaria. It's very boring, infantile, silly and seemingly the product of a low intelligence. It's not really a film for adults, because it's too childish and naive for that, and it's neither a film for children, because it's too arty and slow for that. And it features even a sex toy, so it's not really family friendly either. Sure, it's an unusual film, but this is no quality in itself, if there's no story to tell or any substance. This is a film for no one, except some movie freaks, who like to see a film without any dialogue. But they should watch instead ""Le dernier combat"" (1983), the far superior debut feature by Luc Besson, which was obviously a huge influence on this. Besson did it much better years before and created a small classic. This is a waste of time."
1,regular,1," Not every movie / story / TV show needs a ""reboot"". And that word in its current sense needs to be rebooted out of our lexicon. Rather than worrying about a reboot of a story that's been done to death, how about just telling a good story in an interesting way. Period."
0,regular,0,Enjoyable thriller. Don't let the Movie-reviewer wanna-be's dissuade you from a good movie.
1,regular,1,"There is not one single person who has seen this film who can like it on anything other than ideological grounds.  It is boring, didctic, and pedestrian.  The acting is straight out of 70s prime-time, and the director seems to have studied USA Network made-for-TV movies of the 1990s quite well.  As a film, it is poorly made; even if you consider yourself an Objectivist, save your money on this dud."

1,regular,1,"A great disappointment. So far the worst Star Wars movie. Weak plot, shallow characters and except from a few CGI moments completely forgettable."
1,regular,1,"Ugh!As good a job as Peter Jackson did with the rings, I simply cannot believe he is destroying The Hobbit. The Hobbit is the introductory book to the world of Tolkein and he is crapping all over it. This is, however, the best Harry Potter movie to date!"
0,regular,0," Before the incident, these young Parisians act as if they'd be at home in a trailer park if they had the money for a RV. But then the husband does something unforgivable, and the emotional age of the mother is brought up to speed. What was plural(in reference to the characters' demeanor), now becomes singular, and the dual meaning behind the film's title is unveiled. ""L'Enfant"" is a story about arrested development. Although the docu-drama approach to ""Le Fils"" is greatly missed(this film is shot more like ""La Promesse""), the ambiguity remains, albeit later in the game. In ""Le Fils"", we're not sure about the carpenter's interest in the young boy, and in ""L'Enfant"", an act of contrition might indeed be an act of self-interest. ""L'Enfant"" is a very good film, but it's not the equivalent of ""Le Fils"" and ""Rosetta""."
0,regular,0,I don't understand why people dislike this movie. It was pretty good. The story was comical and cool. The acting was good. It's not my favorite movie but it's definitely a movie worth seeing.
0,regular,0,"Finally Star Wars evolved and found a formula to evoke emotions in a non-nostalgic way. Disney realised that 'never change a winning formula' wasn't in place anymore. They needed new values and leave the predictable (and almost milked) concepts behind. The simplicity of good versus evil makes place for something more nuanced. A lot of people will hate this movie. I can only applause it.By the time the movie ended, it had brought pure catharsis. One advice: go empty-minded and enjoy the ride."

1,regular,1," I also walked out on this movie. It might be possible to interpret it as sharp, Swiftian satire on American bigotry, but it is much easier for audiences to laugh, not because they get the more subtle points it perhaps tries to make, but because they find its crudities, its racism, its homophobia, its sexism, and its anti-Semitism funny on their own. I think this movie gives Americans an excuse to claim they are watching something very high-minded while actually revelling in their own prejudice."
0,regular,0,"Stars Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto certainly put themselves through the ringer here playing aids stricken characters, McConaughey even going as far as to shed a considerable amount of weight for his role. Economical editing propels the story forward and the two lead actors are superb even if the film suffers from a mid section that seems to lose some momentum. Things become very emotional at the end with Leto registering strongly in these scenes."
1,regular,1,"Why is this film so praised? Our protagonists are a naive stuck-up girl right out of college and an equally stuck-up cynical actor. Neither show any real interest in Japanese culture (he's even quite disrespectful) and neither makes any really attempt to connect with the Japanese (even though they both get the chance to connect). Even though she seems to have a degree in philosophy and he seems to be somewhat of an intellectual type, their interactions remain mostly superficial. And still, their interaction with one another is pretty much everything we get to see for this entire film. I guess this film appeals to people just as pretentious and shallow as the main protagonist (which is the only reason I can think of to explain its popularity), but I personally found it hard to connect with either of them AT ALL. Further, I wonder how much sense it makes for their relationship to have remained purely platonic. Both seem to be estranged from their respective spouses, his wife is on the other side of the ocean, her husband is on a photo shoot for several days, both act like they haven't had sex in a long time, she's a beautiful impressionable young girl, he's a famous actor, they both don't shun alcohol and at one point they become close enough to lie together on a bed while he touches her feet. Maybe it's just me, but I personally find it hard to believe they didn't end up having sex together considering the aforementioned conditions. Anyway, the shame and confusion arising from such a situation (after both realise they made a mistake cheating their respective spouse) would at least have made a far more interesting film to watch Maybe this film appeals to people who never spent more than a few days in a foreign country, but having spent about 3 months in Poland I couldn't see anything I haven't experienced myself AT A FAR GREATER INTENSITY. For me, this makes ""Lost In Translation"" as exciting to watch as two people sitting at a bus stop waiting for the bus to arrive. Actually the latter would probably be more interesting, because the bus doesn't take THAT long to arrive."

0,regular,0,"A sweet film. The lives entwined by childhood innocence, love and consequences enlivened by the beautiful natural surroundings helped it become more bearable. This film was naturally emotional, instead of forcing yourself not to cry, it does it for you. It also has one of the most haunting endings you could ever have in such a drama. If the film is that good, I will have to read the book as well. The acting in this is also particularly significant, such as the traumatic performance of the life of Briony."
1,regular,1," What a completely implausible, unrealistic tale. Why would any one not admit the true motive for such an act - love based euthanasia unless they were totally pathologically masochistic and equally totally inconsiderate of their family's feelings? Why wouldn't any one have arrived at the most obvious,and reasonable explanation? If you like a melodramatic weeper this film should float your boat. Of course Kristin is very easy on the eyes, even when morbid of visage as is mostly here ."

Started watching with the idea that i'm not gonna like it. 5 Minutes in I'm interested and by the end I was on the edge of my seat.The thing is, I was rooting for the blind guy to kill them and fyeah. But as soon as we saw the person being held up in the basement.. boy I was not on his side, Fun watch, good acting, maybe hoping for a part 2. BUT if there is a part 2 and its the guy chasing after the girl..  the guy didn't get her name or aadress or anything, just her voice and the smell of her shoes.  And the police think there were two people robbing the place."
1,regular,1,"The positive reception from the users on this site just goes to show how easily entertained people are.  This movie is completely souless.  Every character feels like a cardboard cut out, which is unforgivable when you cast the likes of Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, and Diane Lane.  Man of Steel tries to be dark, and at times it is, but the movie is a little too corny to be taken seriously.  It's basically a slightly better version of a Michael Bay film, and that is obviously not meant as a compliment.  I can't remember the last time I was more dissapointed in a movie, but I suppose that's my own fault for getting excited for a Superman movie."
0,regular,0,"A really great arc - if Craig finished here it would be a great place to end. But I'm desperately hoping he makes another one or even two. He took a silly franchise full of cheesy gags, stupid plot lines, bad actors, and terrible directing and made it into a distinguished cinematic phenomenon. Bravo, Mr. Craig. You've got the intellect and tenacity to fulfill your goals with this outstanding film. Thank you for bringing Spectre to us."

0,regular,0," Just look at the non-State cast that's in this film. Cooper, Banks, Poehler, Meloni, Pierce, Moreau, Rudd, Shannon, it's ridiculous. You think all these people got it wrong? Like they didn't all WANT to be in this flick? David Wain is a genius. ANYONE who says this movie is stupid can just drive their SUV off a cliff after picking up their fat children from Sunday School. It's beyond pathetic that I ever respected morons like Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post. This movie will not be accepted as legendary for at least another decade, but when it comes down to it, many of the actors who contributed to this work will look back on it as their finest of shining moments. I can't wait for Wain and Michael to come out with the prequel to Wet Hot. Buy the State on DVD!!!!"
0,regular,0," I'm getting pretty sick of those people saying that there is no chemistry between Farrell and Foxx- what do you expect, for them to kiss?? These characters are meant to be professionals who reside within a corrupt, bloody and violent environment. Mann is exploring the conflict in these characters of being in such an environment and having to supress their emotion. As a result Crockett and Tubbs have to be cold hearted. The fact that there are so many sex scenes? Perhaps to show that real love cannot exist within these surroundings. Miami Vice is not supposed to be 'glamourous' or 'rewarding'. Mann should be praised at not conforming to 'Hollywood' style 'wrappings'. The characters are meant to be distanced from the viewer. This is perhaps why we struggle to understand the dialogue and the speech. Mann does not want the middle class viewer to say to themselves--'oh I can connect with these characters, now I understand what this kind of life is all about' and then switch off the Tv or leave the cinema to return to milk and cookies and a warm bed. Crockett and Tubbs are meant to be difficult. People complain that there is essentially no story, which is absolutely dim-witted. The story is at its basic level a drugs bust. There thats it: what more do you want, aliens? The Lock Ness monster? A talking square of sponge? This film is searching for a gritty realism and that means no resolved endings or reformed charcaters, no closure or final resolutions which the viewer can be 'satisfied' that everything has fallen into place. The title only comes up at the end because nothing has changed: there will always be guns, drugs and killings. There will always be vice, and no Crockett or Tubbs can change this."
0,regular,0,This is definitely the best action pack movie from Mission Impossible series and the best action pack movies this year. It is a non-stop action movie right from the beginning till the end. It is very important to catch audience attention for the first 2 to 5 minutes of play time. This movie did a great job on this and kept continuing till the end. Action packed movies lovers would definitely quarantee to love this.
0,regular,0,"Cowboys &amp; Aliens is very entertaining. Is it art? No. It's just great commercial entertainment. It's an exciting, funny, scary way to spend a couple of hours. It's shot beautifully. The casting is first rate. The faces on the old west guys are worth the price of admission. It's not nearly as good a film as the first Alien movie, but it has a lot of the same scary/entertaining qualities. If you want to have a fun ride on a Friday night or Saturday afternoon this the movie to see. Should you see it now or wait until it's available to rent? See it in a theater. The sound and visual effects demand a big screen. You can rent it later. Because you'll want to see it again."

1,regular,1,"I never thought there would be a Star Wars movie that would make me want to walk out of the theater. I never thought there would be a Star Wars movie that I never wanted to watch again. I never thought one Star Wars movie could taint the entire series, possibly beyond repair - but somehow they managed to do all those things.I have watched the original trilogy easily 50 times. I grew up in awe at the universe that George Lucas created, in awe of the amazing way Star Wars balanced incredible creativity and imagination with down to earth, amazing characters. The balance of being very futuristic, but almost in a way so nuanced and relatable that it seemed like it could actually be real.Enter The Last Jedi - completely took all relatability and threw it out the window. This movie completely started rewriting the Star Wars universe. The Force is apparently much different than the other 8 movies showed us. Characters apparently use 10 times the amount of sarcasm and humor that they did in the other 8 movies. The physics of space are different than the other 8 movies.Not to mention, the many totally and utterly pointless scenes that did nothing for the story or the character - What was the point of Rey going into that dark hole and seeing 1,000 of herself in the mirror?! Why was the code breaker in a jail cell if he could just let himself out?I physically cringed/rolled my eyes multiple times during the movie. They took the beauty, the depth, the amazingness of the Star Wars saga and made it a cheap, made-for-merchandise, gimmicky superhero movie a la Transformers or Avengers. It screamed ""WE MADE THIS SO WE CAN MAKE LOTS OF MONEY"" not ""WE MADE THIS BECAUSE WE FREAKING LOVE STAR WARS"". I cannot believe this movie is supposed to sit next to the original trilogy on the shelf.There were so many moments I thought there might, just might, be a redeemable storyline and every time it was a let down. Poe going rogue to save the day - nope, just kidding. Finn giving his life to save everything - nope, replaced by the cheesiest line I've ever heard from Rose, a totally disposable character who seemed thrown in for the diversity requirement. Imagine if Laura Dern's AWFUL character (I was hoping she would die the entire movie) was replaced by Admiral Ackbar giving himself up for the resistance!! It would have been so much better and a character anybody remotely cared about. Luke following Obi-Wan's example and giving himself up - nope, he was Force appearing somewhere (which no Jedi master has ever been able to do before) and died anyways.....WHAT?!!?!Not to mention, the agendas and cheesy messages that were so obviously pushed throughout the film - ""You can do anything you want, no matter where you come from"" ""It's not about fighting against what you hate, its about fighting for what you love"" Save the animals. Be a vegetarian. I could keep going. There is nothing wrong with these messages, its just that they were forced into a STAR WARS MOVIE! Go put that in your low-budget animated  for kids, Disney. It was an assault on the audience's intelligence, like the director didn't realize people would pick up on how obviously he was forcing messages through. So many terrible lines as well, like the characters were giving us all a play by play. (Finn saying, ""Man, they hate that ship"" or Poe ""Oh, so you mean we're going to slip down to the surface and wait for the First Order to pass"") Thank you for forever ruining this series, idiots. Thank you for literally destroying a piece of my childhood. I just can't believe this movie was released. I might need freaking therapy to get over it (ok, a little over the top). Our only hope is that JJ Abrams that somehow pull this train back onto the tracks. But its a long journey back to the tracks."
0,regular,0,"Giamatti's character's dimensions are written with such care that it makes him tangible and engaging.  He's both fragile and explosive.  When set against Haden Church's aging jock it creates a great story with a Laurel &amp; Hardy quality to it.  What I liked though is that looks at love were highly imperfect but still had real consequences.  Jennifer Aniston is not in this film. The actors are believable.  I was able to want to believe them, right or wrong, for better or worse."

The romance trivializes the situation, the shoddy history attacks Mormons, the sappy writing makes one gnash their teeth. The worst movie ever. (and why are the reasons that it was given an 8 or 10? Because ""Voigt said"" or ""Mormons won't like it"" or ""it's not attacking Mormons"". Please. How stupid can they be."

But, you will only think about it if u have at least a little sense of humanity. If you haven't, so u may say the movie is preposterous."
1,regular,1,"Saw the film yesterday at a double feature knowing nothing about the plot of the new film. Now that I'm sure it will be one of the Epic fails of Hollywood history, there may some nostalgic value to the ticket stub like the summary says, ...  "" Using recovered alien technology, the nations of Earth have collaborated on an immense defense program to protect the planet. But nothing can prepare us for the aliens’ ... ..except of course,  for Jeff Goldblum, with a new love interest - (I guess there wasn't still some love there..) and this IMHO was the main flaw - they made up an imaginary earth where (because of the previous alien invasion) all countries live together in peace, and we have outposts on Jupiter and nearby planets , including bases on the moon, all  amazingly accomplished in only 20 years! ( Alien invasions might be good for us?) So this time its jets outfitted with alien weaponry, and US soldiers with laser weapons - it is clearly Star Wars envy!  And therefore it goes from being a disaster movie to episode one of the new fantasy story where we learn how mankind goes from a  peace loving species (organic life form) to an invading alien ass kicker who will boldly go where no man has gone before, to kill aliens with their own technology while they sleep - courtesy of the iBeachball from space and a long dead alien race. Episode 2  Revenge .... Now we'll be the aliens taking over planets and consuming all their resources and polluting them at the same time - Watch out the humans are coming!"

Take the two annoying cutesy children from the original Jurassic Park (where there were dinosaurs to watch at least), add a plot twist you could see coming after the first 10 minutes (well, maybe two minutes), several foul adult diapers, some silly references to the oven in Hansel and Gretel, and you’ve got a real stink bomb on your hands. I am amazed that this got the decent critical reviews that it did. Worse yet, we had to sit through the coming attractions for Pan – I guess we were just the wrong audience. The actors who played the grandparents didn’t do a bad job, and you had to feel sorry for them since they had so little to work with."

1,regular,1,"The new Dreamworks animated movie is a spin-off of the popular but not so good Madagascar film series and it’s their 3rd feature of this year following Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman and the sequel to How To Train Your Dragon. The plot involves the 4 well-known cute and cuddly penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private going against our villain, a purple octopus named Dr. Octavius Brine who’s trying to collect all the penguins around the world and transform them from cute and cuddly to monstrous and disgusting. On their way they encounter an elite undercover inter-species task force called North Wind that the penguins will also have to deal with. Now, this is a spy thriller and like all spy thrillers this one features a lot of gadgets and super-secret agents trying to stop a villain from conquering the world. Classic formula. Thus, when going into a movie like this you have to suspend your disbelief because you know that some of the gadgets or gizmos are capable of the implausible. However, this is not the case because the most inconceivable comes from the things that go down in the action scenes. It’s not ridiculous in a fun way. It’s ridiculous in a head-scratching and unpleasing way. You could dispute about the fact that is an animation and things like this shouldn’t be taken seriously but even for an animated movie it is unendurable. I was in with my 12 year old cousin and I thought she would like the film but I noticed that she facepalmed herself lots of times during its running. That’s how you know they went over the top. The movie begins with our 4 fellas breaking into Fort Knox as a present for Private’s birthday. They arrive on a makeshift glider, they take down a few guards and put in an unlikely voice password (but hey, you never know) and boom they’re in like that but wait because the movie isn’t only taking our suspension of disbelief and is beating it over with a mace but it also makes us drop our jaw on the floor from how stupid it can be. So, after they break in arguably the most guarded place in the world with just a few moves,they’re not looking for the gold but for the chips vending machine that’s in the back of the gold room. I am not even kidding. That happened. Later they escape from an airplane that flies at an altitude of 8 km (if I don’t mistake) by opening the cargo door and breathing without worries as if they were on the ground. Below them another airplane is on the route and they jump and just smash through the steel fuselage and get inside, again like it’s something normal, and get to the cabin and take out the pilots and change course while the passengers in the back are just a bit scared because of some penguins breaching in. Just that. Something is wrong, isn’t it??? Yes, it is. After Skipper and his comrades smashed in there were no alarms going off, nothing signaling an uncontrolled decompression that would probably,most likely make the plane crash. Only a lot of screaming. But this movie is not only characterized by ludicrous events but also by a clichéd and predictable plot and one-dimensional characters. The screenplay is written by John Aboud, Brandon Sawyer, Tom McGrath and Eric Darnell. There’s nothing interesting about these penguins and since the screenwriters didn’t have any new ideas for an original or at least working story they just put in some spy movie clichés that we all moviegoers know about and added in a dash of gags. Adding some smiles didn’t save its reputation because not even the smiles are good. They either last for too long or just aren’t funny. There was only one pun relating to the fiscal issue in France that actually made me laugh. Though the screenplay wasn’t good I can’t say the same about the camerawork. Sometimes the camera follows graciously and smoothly the protagonists giving the movie a better flow and making the nonsensed and fast action easy to follow. The editing is top notch and the animation is beautiful presenting vivid and powerful colors. These were the only positive aspects of this picture. Luckily, I had the opportunity it in 2D and not in 3D. I heard from different critics that the 3D was good and that’s proving once more that Dreamworks has a certain respect for the 3D but I wish they respected us moviegoers and kids as well by delivering movies that are good on a story level. Honestly, this year was a pretty good year for movies and I thought this one was going to stump my bad feelings regarding it but it’s just another piece of gain from the studios and it’s more an exhausting ride than exhilarating one. Kids will have fun and I guess this film is going to make a crap load of money and it will spawn a few (5) sequels that I hope not, of course, but I fear will all be this bad. Adults will be able to enjoy it only whilst being drunk. Yep, get ready."
1,regular,1,"I really don't know what Alfredson was trying to accomplish with this movie because it is neither smart or complex; It's boring, uneventful, and totally confusing. Trying to be cerebral is one thing. Totally leaving your audience in the dust is another. And I say this admitting that I loved Let the Right one in - a beautiful movie. This on the other hand is self conceited mumbo jumbo."
1,regular,1,"While living up to the brilliance of the revolutionary original trilogy could not be expected. The first instalment of Lucas's 'Prequel Trilogy' really sets the tone for how low star wars would sink. This tale, unlike the first three, contains a story no human could understand and fails at its job to keep even the hardest of fans from shedding a tear at what star wars has become. The only reason I have rated the movie above 1/10 is simply due to John Williams once again incredible score, with 'Dual of the Fates' being a soundtrack masterpiece."

Similarly, when I watch a movie, I look for this same ""orderly arrangement"" of scenes and music that are pleasing to the ears and eyes. This lack of an ""orderly arrangement""  made the movie hard to follow. It looks as if the Director tried too hard to compete with more accomplished directors, such as the maker of ""Gladiator"".  So, I leave this advice for this movie's director:  Begin with the end in mind. Understandably, there is a big gap in the critic ratings.  For those that ranked this movie ""10"", ask them:  What did you like best about this movie? Watch how many times you hear, ""Ah...Well...Let me see...I plan to see it again.""

1,regular,1,"American Hustle does not bring us anything new, and yet it still manages take risks in the end were completely unnecessary. I think people are fooled by the stellar cast and flashy costumes into thinking this is a good movie. If this same movie were made by M. Night Shyamalan, people would be saying it was just another bad Shyamalan film. Because it is from David O. Russell, people praise it as another good Russell film. This is a film that is supposed to focus around the idea of survival, and what you would do in order to get the money, or fame, that you need in order to survive. Yet it teaches us nothing new about the ideals of American society, and this fictional telling of an actual historical event falls flat on its face at it appears as just that: Fictional. David O. Russell dazzled with The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, but he just got too cocky here and thought he could tackle 5 different characters in an interwoven story and still allow us to focus on one thing. The acting is great, no doubt, and the writing is pretty good too. However, we end up getting bored by the pointlessness and irrelevance. The opening 10 minutes is some of the worst filmmaking I've ever seen. Though it picks up decently after that, it is not nearly enough to save what I view as an unnecessary movie."
1,regular,1,"Don't waste your time. It's not scary. Don't think: Maybe fun to watch because it's a bad movie and could therefore be entertaining. Well if you just happen to have a heavily security-guarded cinema filled with people raging about the stupidity of this film be welcome to somehow enjoy part of the movie but by no means think you won't feel disappointed in the end.Read the Spoiler reviews to know what exactly is wrong with the film and go on with your life, PS: Yes, I registered an account just to rage about the film and I feel better now, thanks!"

1,regular,1,"Let me start out, Yes, I have read book, and yes I Loved the book. I think it one of the best book I've ever read. I've was excited when the movie was Announced. Then the trailer... I got nervous. Very nervous. But I was still excited. So months pasted by and I forgot about the movie until July. Then the movie came out at No.5 at the Box Office. Boys, We have a Bomb at our hands. So today, My sister decided to buy my ticket for this movie for my Birthday. After the first 10 min of this movie. I knew it was bad. The Story: If you read the book. You still don't know the story, According to the writers. The Acting: Okay... At times. Now that I think about it, it bad. Taylor Swift has 15 seconds of screen time. Even though she has 3 billing in the cast list. The Additional's: This category is about any of the Additions added into the movie. They forced a love triangle. The love story was so forced. It laughable how cheesy it was. I can explain it in two word: Completely Unncessary The Ending: They change the ending a lot. Now instead of having it end on a cliffhanger. That to complicated for us. =Sarcasm. Now they end with Jonas passing the Barrier of Memory. Now everyone in the ""Community's"" have memories. Nice job Phillip Noyce. You buttered the best ending to book, ever. Overall: I despise this movie. I hate it. 0/10"

Not sure why viewers weren't rating this movie higher.  Mind you this movie wasn't up for any Oscars nor should it have been, but still if you love non-stop over the top action then this is the movie for you!!  Based on current affairs this movie makes you think a little about waht could happen if we were under siege.  As a citiizen we just don't know how fallible our white house is??  Hopefully they would put up more safe guards than they did in the movie.  That said remind yourself this is a movie and yes some of the content was over the top, but I still give it a 9 because of the actors and the actresses involved, and for the top notch edge of your seat action.  Don't make the same mistake I did, if you haven't seen it give it a try.  Now I am all set to go see the sequel out in two weeks!!!!!!  I can't wait...................."

0,regular,0," I've heard everything on the spectrum for this movie, from too dark and different from the first, to the same old crap. I watched this movie opening night with the expectation of it holding the bar set by the first one. Coming out of the theatre I realised I'd experienced a much different movie from the first, a much darker and more character driven movie. Oddly enough I also find myself disagreeing with those who think this movie is funnier. I enjoyed this movie, and hold it up to par with the first: a moodier atmosphere, deeper characters, and a step away from typical romanticism and cheesy lines, all of which play to my preferences. Worth seeing if you have an open mind, dont expect every inch of novelty the first one had (it is the same series after all), and are willing to give the characters some room to grow. Final thoughts: Yes it is noticably long &amp; Davy Jones' is incredible: flawless animation and excellent acting seemlessly combined."
0,regular,0,Non-stop fun... not for old people (who need meaningful dialog for some reason) ; it's a younger crowd that will be absolutely ecstatic with this movie. The visuals are unbeatable from beginning to end.
0,regular,0,"Immediately from seeing the trailer, I wanted to see this movie so badly. My first impression and repeatedly seeing the trailer made me so anxious to see it, and finally I did and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. There are some totally tragic parts that I won't spoil, but the whole time it's thrilling watching Dr. Ryan Stone (played by Sandra Bullock) try to escape the space debris and you can't help but root for her. George Clooney's character brings lightness to an otherwise dark and terrifying situation. Also, Sandra Bullock plays Dr. Stone so well that you cringe when she cringes, and can see every aspect of her predicament from how she would be seeing it, which is so great. So overall, Gravity gets a 10 because it was such a gripping, smart movie."

0,regular,0,"Five men pushing middle age go out drinking and get slaughtered, in some cases quite literally, in “The World’s End,” the latest highly enjoyable exercise in jaunty pastiche from writer-director Edgar Wright and writer-thesp Simon Pegg, the brains behind “Shaun of the Dead,” and “Hot Fuzz.” Although a fraction less gut-bustingly goofy than its predecessors. Feckless fortysomething man-child Gary King (Pegg) decides to reassemble “the five musketeers,” a band of old friends who haven’t really seen each other since they graduated from high school. Gary wants to have another try at completing the Golden Mile, during which the participants must drink a pint of beer at each of the 13 pubs in their home town of Newton Haven — an adventure they first attempted back in 1990 without getting beyond the sixth drinking den. By tradition, the last stop must be at the World’s End, a common pub moniker in Blighty that acquires extra significance here. Unlike Gary, who was once the gang’s leader but now barely has the money to launder his Sisters of Mercy T-shirt, the other members of the group now seemingly act their age and hold down proper jobs. In the case of mild-mannered Peter (Marsan, so often the MVP in pics like “Happy-Go-Lucky” and “Vera Drake”), that means working at his dad’s car showroom to support his wife and kids. Money-minded Oliver (Martin Freeman) has become a real-estate agent glued to his Bluetooth, while recently divorced Steven (the ever-flawless Considine), perhaps the sharpest of the bunch but without Gary’s cockiness, works in construction. All agree to join in Gary’s scheme, only because he promises that Andrew (Wright and Pegg’s usual wingman, Nick Frost), now a high-powered lawyer, has said he’ll come, too. But it turns out that Andrew has the biggest beef with Gary and is now a teetotaler to boot. Nevertheless, once the first act is finished, the men duly begin their trek down memory lane on a summer’s night, only to find that their old stomping ground is not quite the same as they remember it. Most of the pubs, as revealed in one of the pic’s best jokes (and one that Brits will particularly appreciate), have lost much of their unique character. Even creepier is the fact that some local faces are exactly the same, and seem to have barely aged a day. It’s a bit of a shame that the trailer completely gives away the film’s first big twist (if you care to preserve the surprise, read no further): that residents of Newton Haven have been replaced by mechanical replicants for reasons explained only later. No doubt the marketing departments involved felt it necessary to leak this spoiler in order to sufficiently convey the pic’s horror-thriller aspects, but thankfully there are more twists and surprises in store, stacking reveal upon reveal to near-ludicrous levels that self-consciously evoke the Quatermass films from the 1950s. Other touchstones include the fiction of John Wyndham (“Village of the Damned,” “The Day of the Triffids”), plus big dollops of “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” (both the 1956 and 1978 versions) and a bit of John Carpenter’s “The Thing,” plus many other references, even to chopsocky classics. ndeed, the script by Wright and Pegg sometimes feels somewhat crudely carpentered at times to include references exclusively for the delectation of genre-savvy auds. A bit more consideration might have been paid to nuts-and-bolts issues, such as why the hell do the principals keep going along with the pub crawl once it’s apparent that no good, not least for their livers, can ever come from seeing it through. Then again, that sort of devil-may-care attitude toward logic is consistent with the characters themselves. Deep down, “The World’s End” feels by, about and for the sort of wry, semi-smart, semi-stupid, semi-adolescent blokes (to use a Britishism that perfectly captures the vibe) seen here, which might have alienated more femme viewers if Rosamund Pike weren’t on hand to provide such a spunky, likable rooting interest in her Sam, an object of affection for both Gary and Steven. Most importantly, the core five thesps interlock tightly as an ensemble; the horsepower of their collective comic timing makes some of the chatty, interstitial dialogue note-perfect, even if they’re just shooting the  Bill Pope’s handsome widescreen lensing on good, old-fashioned 35mm adds to the retro vibe, while kudos are also due to Paul Machliss for punchy editing work. Other tech credits are aces."

0,regular,0,War Horse is a classic Spielberg film with its great landscapes and excellent music. i loved the way the movie showed how the horse transformed each character it met through the war.  A truly wonderful film for the whole family.
0,regular,0," For those of you who cast aside this work of art as nothing more than a pretentious 'art flick', you are sadly mistaken. It is personal to the core. Through the tellings of the three personae of past, future, and present, this movie brings to life the core essence of humanity and life itself. The pretentious ones are those who begrudge this film for the fact that what may seem a simple axiom to them was elaborated over the course of a 90-some odd minutes. The impact of this movie is not what could be summarized of this movie in a few words, but rather the journey the protagonists take throughout the course of it, as well as the visually stunning way the movie was brought together from end-to-beginning. This movie is only frustrating for those who become impatient watching water boil. For others, it expresses a true experience into the indomitable cycle of life. Those who say otherwise are the pretentious ones."
0,regular,0,"From its scale, action, comedy, and expectation subversion, Avengers: Infinity War is truly a spectacle and arguably the most daring blockbuster ever put to screen. It succeeds in providing an exhilarating, emotional, and excellent filmgoing experience. Thanos is the best villain in the MCU no doubt, the time and attention given to his character and motivations is worth the 10 year buildup. My only flaws with this film are the somewhat forced relationships between characters and motivations and the film's ""part 1"" nature. Other than that, this film must be experienced in theaters and is one of the most epic movies I have seen in a long time."

1,regular,1,"I used to visit Metacritic regularly for professional critic reviews, only to find the muscles in my face contracting due to the abysmal hatred that develops in me as I read them. How can they be so wrong? Why is it that  between myself and these professionals (and those who agree with them) there is always a dimension separating our expectations and verdicts? Well fear not, here I will attempt to explain to you the truth behind the matter- but first I wish to thank Metacritic for adding a user-critic section which is as versatile as the professional-critic's section; it was at that moment when the muscles in my face hardened that I would find immediate relief, as my gaze shifted slowly to the right of this website, I would find truthful human beings who devoured a stinking mess and dissected it piecemeal for the benefit of saving someone elses time. I was vaccinated with Star Wars before 10 years of age. I watched it in the order as they released- A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back was playing with almost every meal ive had during my younger years. The old movies represent high quality literature transformed into something greater, because that is what happens when you finely tune music, cinematrography, character, genre, comprehension, and script into a story that you (Lucas) were sure would be spine-tingly epic. To give just 1 example of how good everything is in 4-6, whenever I watch the movies with family or friends, all chatter drops and heads turn to the tv when Vader enters a scene- why? We are pushed even further when a strong plot twist is delivered by none other than Vader, and suddenly this character is complete in our minds. Lucas knew what everyone really expected from a good villain and cocktailed a perfect mix of mystery/malovelence/intelligence/demeanor/resolve each of which was masterfully albeit breifly presented in the originals. His persona was installed in a plot which exhibits enough intelligence to be quality comprehension material in a high-school english exam, and yet at the same time be easy for even kids to understand and continue fantasizing about. Not just Vader, all characters have this air of careful characterization around them- Lucas pulled it off in episode 4, and made an even better sequel (5) with the help of his mentor, and it concluded nicely in the final episode (6). That is precisely when Star Wars ended- Make no mistake, intentions have shifted darkly when Lucasarts realized just exactly how much money was made, and how much money can still be made. Now that a solid foundation has been established, whatever is built on top will never crumble- just like if a group of the best construction workers were tricked into building the best skeleton for a huge orphanage or hospital, only to see it turn into a popular snooker bar with Dota consoles in the basement floor. It is ironic that the last movie Lucas made- episode 3- ended with evil destroying good, which is so fitting with Lucas's attempts at relating Star Wars to politics that I feel like this time-swap was done for this purpose alone- a subliminal message that Evil did ultimately triumph after all 6 movies were watched. And you know evil did indeed triumph when ""mix master"" (as some other user critic put it) Jew Jew Abrams transformed Star Wars from its already low point of a looming money-printing story-void husk into an even lower level, pandering to the ideals set by Disney's Zionist overlords. What's that? ""What are their ideals?"" Many, but one example prominent in Star Wars 7 is the ultimate brainless ham fist enclosed within the image of a very masculine woman, smashing through the audience all over the world in cinemas, blood and guts spraying all over the place as it happens- even with fatalities of victims who attempted to run away from the collision sprawled all over cinema exits, white chalk outline and everything-. If that last part was too much for you, then to sum it up in a different way, this movie is nonsensical pop-culture silage produced specifically for the inept masses, and for increasing the potential number of these masses; do not watch it."

0,regular,0,"Sausage Party is seriously the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. The movie makes use of our ravenous food culture and unorthodoxly uses the setting as a satire about the world's state of belief. The concept is executed in a manner analogous an extreme South Park episode. The use of food makes the irreverent humor all too easy at times, but Sausage Party manages to find shocking ways to keep the laughs coming. Point in case.. bath salts are used to explain the metaphysical separation of the anthropomorphic food and the ""gods"" who eat them. In this example, the writers are clearly making fun of the typically kid-friendly genre (ex. the Toys in Toy Story). The movie is definitely not for the easily offended (100% not for families/kids). I am already anticipating the number of complaints we will get at my theater. In short, the film is a step away from NC-17 and all the better for it."
1,regular,1,"I come away from ""The Last Jedi"" feeling much the same way I felt about ""The Force Awakens,"" but a little more. These movies aren't for me, anymore. The spectacle is great, the special effects are great, the performances are mostly great, but the written material doesn't work for me. The humour, the use of characters, even basic narrative structure. Every single creative decision, big and small, felt wrong, to me. Every part of this film is the opposite of what I find dramatically satisfying. It left me feeling somehow empty. Without hope for the future."
1,regular,1,"I learned a lesson (again) about the reviews of critics. Never again will I base my movie going decisions on them. . Did we watch the same movie?

1,regular,1,"Ancient...Korean secret? What the Calgon is going on here? Just because the actor portraying the assassin comes from South Korea, ""The Warrior's Way"" still has a lot to answer for, in regard to the wait it reinforces(or is that reintroduces?) the old stereotype of the Chinese laundryman. Jang Dong-gun, best known for his role in Kang Je-Gyu's ""Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War"", plays a character whose surname just happens to be both Korean, and Chinese, in a film whose audience probably would be hard-pressed to differentiate the two. Yang, a ""Yojimbo""-like anti-hero, formerly of The Sad Flutes(described in the titles as being ""the cruelest assassins in the east), is perceived explicitly as a ""China man"", in spite of the uni-racial name, because his kind(more so than the Koreans and the Japanese) are associated with the Old West, having worked extensively on the First Transcontinental Railroad in the mid-nineteenth century. Predictably, there's not a train to be found in this frontier outpost, even though the inhabitants who call the desert their home, couldn't possibly survive without infrastructure; in other words, a functional railroad, by which food and supplies could be received on a weekly basis from the cities. Already straddling the line of political correctness, any sense of realism had to be discarded(a ferris wheel, really?) in order to keep ""The Warrior's Way"" from crossing that line, so the locomotives had to go, since its presence would damage the filmmaker's ability to cultivate the lie, in which Yang's ethnicity is of an indeterminate origin, what the titles vaguely state as ""the east"". A train can't help but signify Yang as Chinese, and the town(with the circus-based economy) he defends against ""The Colonel""(Danny Huston) and his gang of desperadoes, as a place that resembles, however faintly, western civilization from out of the past. Surrounded by circus freaks, among them, a ""midget"", a guy who breathes fire, and a bearded lady, Yang's otherness, his exotic looks, and way with a sword, makes him ""one of [them]"", an attraction, as if a ""yellow"" face was some sort of physical abnormality, which taints the kiss he shares with Lynne(Kate Bosworth), in what should be a taboo-shattering moment(compare this kiss with the tentative one Jackie Chan gives Amber Valetta in Brian Levant's ""The Spy Next Door""), but conversely, becomes a spectacle, since the cowgirl is kissing a monstrosity, a freak, somebody from the mysterious east. When ""The Saddest Flute""(Lung Ti) finally tracks down his former disciple, his negative assertion concerns him alone, and not his race as a whole(the implied Chinese), because this is an America untethered from the historical record, and on a filmic level, the western myth created by the John Ford movies, and others of its ilk. In this world, an Asian may be expected to do the laundry, but the absence of a track suggests that the ""Chinese"", unlike their real-life counterparts, were never imported from their motherland to help install a railway system, which as a result, undoes the associative stereotype, making the stock occupation of laundryman into a mere business that Yang's friend(also from ""the east"") just happened to undertake. ""The Warrior's Way"" does away with the notion that the east is split into nations and factions as a means for perpetuating race in a brazenly callous fashion that borders on racist."
0,regular,0,"Very engrossing film directed by Steven Spielberg; it is to be hoped that he will be directing more fine films in the future, as opposed to only producing them (hardly an artistic endeavor). The film holds one's attention throughout (there was no inclination to peek at a watch to see when it will be over). Tom Hanks gives his usual workmanlike performance as James Donovan, the lawyer who becomes Rudolf Abel's lawyer, then is at the center of the negotiations to trade Abel for an American pilot. I thought Mark Rylance was outstanding as Abel. Definitely one of the better movies of 2015, thus far."
1,regular,1,"0 for the plot Without a plot there is not point in making a film. Therefore a higher score cannot be justified. BB8 does not have to deliver the map. It is not integral to the unit. R2D2 had to be delivered safely, everyone was looking for the droid, being associated with the droid lead to the deaths of Luke's uncle. When one can simply remove the map from the droid where does the tension lie with being associated with the machine? Why would someone in such deep hiding leave a map. This plot line is beyond moronic. A map is there to find treasure or inanimate objects not a human. Max von Sydow dies after 1 whole minute of meaningless dialogue. I don't know who he is. Therefore his death is meaningless, the bad guy in the film is not elevated to evil, just a senseless killing. A Stormtrooper, janitor, sent with a death squad to wherever, suddenly develops a conscience. Later in the film Budha trooper has no hesitation in killing his once fellow comrades, or picking up a sabre to strike out. He is not a Jedi the first to wield a light sabre without training, or believing in the force. Saving his once enemy Poe they become best of friends straight away. Upon crashing, with a handy parachute which seems to be located beside the downed craft, Poe is nowhere to be seen. He doesn't reappear for most of the film. No Tie Fighters chase the fighter to the planet to check it has been destroyed? Rey, the healthiest scavenger in the galaxy, soon to become insta Jedi, mechanic, pilot, just takes BB8 without any fuss from a fellow scavenger. Then decides to keep it instead of trading for food, really! You are starving to death and find a top of the range television, you can complete the rest. It is out of character. Straight away you question her and her motives. Rey knows the Falcon, inside and out, this heap of junk which by all accounts would have been a part of the ""legends"" which both Finn and Rey are aware, yet there it lies melting under the baking sun on the sandy dust hole all along in her back yard and no one thinks to scavenge it? When she does expertly fly it and later on partners Han she knows the ship better than Han or Chewie. Doesn't that make them the worst pilot and copilot in Star Wars lore, no wonder the Falcon never flew properly, all they needed was Super Rey the whole time. Undermines two vital characters, I didn't even trust Han to fly the Falcon for the rest of the movie. Ren, stops a laser blast mid air, gets hit by a wookie blasting him from farther away? 3P0 has a red arm, this furthers the plot, how? Apparently no spares even though Chewie meticulously reconstructs him in Empire? A third Death Star, that can be easily defeated after a quick briefing and no detailed plan on how to defeat it, just some off the cuff remarks as to here we go again folks. The purpose of the ship is to remove the sun from the solar system therefore meaning any or all life is not possible unless a droid populated planet were possible. Therefore removing the sun removes all life. What was the need to destroy the planets, just to have mega explosions to show children in the theatre that the big metal plant is bad and resistance is good. But what are they resisting against, wasn't the Empire defeated? Ren removes a mask upon which we find he doesn't need life support? So the mask is a toy, Disney sales for the mask cannot have been in the minds of the executives? The often scant use of the force, fast food Jedi mind tricks, insta powers, even Vader reminded us ""do not underestimate the power of the force"". It seems as if it's power has been diluted, somewhat. Jedi on tap. Hux a pre pubescent general, shouting and tantrum minded like Ren, exhibits immature and leaderless qualities, responsible to lead a force called the failed order? No new ships in either the Empire or Resistance fleets? Upgrades with new paint but no new craft, I remember wanting to buy Y wing, B wing etc... Disney missed a trick there with the lack of craft. Again lazy. But back to the film, R2 is depressed, Luke was by his side for three films even in Degoba, dumps him, his loyal friend, saved by him in many occasions, but dumped so he switches himself to standby mode. Suddenly at just the right time in the movie he switches on and reveals the rest of the map. Phew! Han locates the Falcon, fifteen seconds after it leaves Jakuu. Cue Ray Harryhausen inspired calamari to inspire him to take back his ship, even while watching this I thought please god no! But it got worse, cue triads from big trouble in little China and an extra from trainspotting. Bobba Fett would have been my choice, the worst scene in any of the franchise. Take a bow Disney. I paid to watch a 200 million pound B movie. I cannot fathom how this film made it past the cutting room floor. Don't even get me started with the lack of music score. Episode 8 the title can only be FROZEN the carbonite years! Han is dead and so is the franchise. It's crap all of i"

1,regular,1,"The person who said this is an example of a movie that shouldn't be remade is right. I don't care what anyone says or how close this movie is to the book, it was TERRIBLE. The original was way better despite it not being close to the book. The cast was memorable, the songs were memorable. And best of all Gene Wilder brought out the best in Wonka were as Depp made him into a creepy MJ wannabe. I read the book and even though this movie included Charlie's father and his occupation, and the ending with the cast off kids, it still fell short. Especially when they included Wonka's daddy dentist issues."

Smith's flim flam man falls head over heels for his fledgling  grifter.  But unlike Tracey and Hepburn - Pitt and Jolie or even Newman and Redford - Smith and Robbies' banter lack rhythm and levity and there are no fireworks. Some leading men best go it alone. Even with a co-star twenty years his junior who is hot hot hot - Smith's sexual chemistry flickers.  And the third wheel- Adrian  Martinez- steals the film.  Surprisingly, with all it's preposterous twists - this caper  telegraphs it's ending.  Holy toledo !"

0,regular,0," Before I begin my review, I just want to relate my experience, prior to seeing this movie. Friday afternoon, a friend and I had gone to see Avatar in RealD 3D at a theatre that was near her house. We enjoyed about 45 minutes of the film when it started to skip... it stopped and started about 3-5 times before it finally froze and shut down. The crowd was outraged and we were told to leave and get ""Rain Check"" passes at customer service because the system had failed and the movie would not play, it would take 3 hours to fix. So with complete disappointed we got out rain check passes and decided to come back the next day after the problem would be fixed. The first 45 minutes that we did see that day was pretty cool so far, so we definitely wanted to give it another go. As we sat in our seats this afternoon (12/19/09) I sensed that something was going to go wrong, and I could tell my friend had similar intuitions. When the movie was finally about to start, they showed the ""please silence your cell phones screen"" and then... it stopped.... frozen... the manager came in and told us what we had feared.... it froze... again and it would take forever to fix. We left the theatre utterly pissed and completely done with the stupid theatre. Full of outrage, I expressed my anger with one of the employees. I attempted to get my money back, she of course told me it was impossible, and instead gave us rain check passes and a few extras because of our inconvenience. (sweet? bitter sweet) We decided to go to Imax instead, we figured the massive screen would make the experience all the more amazing. After driving the long way there, parking, and then running many blocks to Imax, out of breath, we were met with an enormous line and a sign that said ""Avatar 3D, SOLD OUT"" Blast! To cut to the chase, after running back to the parking garage, we went to another theatre owned by the same company as the other theatre that screwed up, and were able to use our passes and get in, and yes that time it worked, no screw ups. After all of this complete heck... IT WAS WELL WORTH IT!! After we left the theatre, we cared little about the shenanigans that went down in attempts to see the movie. We had completely forgotten and were only focused on the movie, and still trying to process it. I've heard complaints about the music and that it wasn't very good... it was great. It was what you'd expect of an epic sci-fi. I've also heard complaints about the story; I didn't see any problem with it either. The only problem I saw was with some of the acting, there were a few actors that didn't seem to do as good of a job as you'd expect for a movie of this magnitude. BUT, the actors in questions were not the focus of the movie and weren't shown often enough to interfere with the experience, thus it wasn't a big problem. The visual effects of this movie were completely amazing. It was hard to believe that most of what we were viewing was all visual effects. The landscapes, the creatures, they were all very crisp and clear, and very realistic. Coupled with the 3D glasses, it almost seemed as if you were there. It is almost hard for me to even describe. The concepts of the movie were not 100% original. A lot of it has been done already to some degree. But the way in which they were presented, to me, seemed totally original. There is something said in the movie that will make you understand more fully the NaÃ¢Â?Â?vi and their existence. ItÃ¢Â?Â?s something that Dr. Augustine said to Mr. Selfridge about the way the planet works and its relationship with the life on the planet. It has something to do with the Ã¢Â?Â?goddessÃ¢Â?Â? that the NaÃ¢Â?Â?vi follow. I would say more, but I donÃ¢Â?Â?t want to spoil it for anyone. Despite the crap that went down before seeing the movie, I enjoyed the experience. I have no regrets, I am absolutely pleased that I went to see it, and glad that I saw it in 3D. It was amazing. Go see it. Now."
0,regular,0,Mad Max: Fury Road does not only deliver a worthy sequel to its predecessors it also sets a new standard for the action cinema. The audience is literally blown away by its bombastic visuals and soundtrack. I've watched a lot of movies but only a few left such an impression. Be it the character design or the overall atmosphere - its just perfect.
1,regular,1," Those of you who voted 10 for this piece of corny popcorn superhero B-gade flick obviously just got out of a dark and campy cave! Shame on you people! You guys just don't cut it being a critic. Ridiculous, simply ridiculous!"

The ensemble does well with the quirkiness of the script, especially this newcomer Tony Revolori, who I daresay was more enjoyable than anyone other than Ralph Fiennes, who is perfect for this role. All in all, it might be a practice for style rather than story, but its over-the-top feel makes it all the more enjoyable."
1,regular,1," If you like x-men at all don't bother with x3. If your looking for a consistant plotline or consistant characters, watch the first two. The new director basically uses x3 as a sounding board for social/political views spewed into an action packed (quite possibly the only decent part of the movie) piece of garbage. His introduction of new characters only serves one purpose, to see what cool new powers we can look at, and that's it. I wish someone had warned me about this, the dissapointment in not worth 9.75."

0,regular,0,"Primer is a phenomenal film that was somehow this good in spite of being shot on a $7,000 budget by first-time director Shane Carruth. Complex, confusing, and all over the place, the film is brilliant in the way it captures all of those feelings so expertly. The characters are confused and have no idea what is happening, thus neither do we. The acting is very good and down-to-earth, which is perfect for this film and the film never looks as though it was shot on a $7,000 budget. On the whole, everybody involved with the production of this film is incredibly talented and it really shines through. Primer is a brilliant work that deserves to be seen by more people because no film has left me so utterly confused, yet so entirely impressed as Primer has."

Jackson the sociopathic murderer with a heart of gold in an action packed flick about two men who have absolutely no chemistry fight Gary Oldman the dictator that isn't aware he's in a comedy movie, then it's your movie.Better than sleeping pills. Someone delusional would call it Deadpool + Pulp Fiction, truth is: it's The Expendables with the comedy of Grown Ups 2.Car explosions and farts. That's about all.If you want to watch a movie with actors who have excellent chemistry on-screen, I highly suggest The Nice Guys with Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe."
1,regular,1,"Knowing a film is based on nonsense before entering probably means I'm more of an idiot for paying money for nonsense, expecting other parts of it to not be nonsense. But guess what?! It's nonsense. Nonsense oozing out of every one of Scarlett Johanson's sexy-smart orifices.The scientists were talking nonsense. The acting was nonsense. Even the humour was nonsense. What's worse, it tried to club in some religious nonsense. I'm pretty sure I spat at the screen at one point! And nobody likes that guy.So there you have it. I definitely won't be naming any of my children Lucy after seeing this utter, infuriating, frustratingly bad, turd of a film. Nonsense!"
1,regular,1," This is a film for idiots. Never before has one movie so astutely singled out the lowest common denominator from its demographic. It isn't funny, it isn't clever, its badly structured and the direction is indescribably hamfisted. A film this pointless and stupid will be forgotten soon enough, and deservedly so. I'm a huge, HUGE fan of both the horror genre, and its mid 1970's heyday. But, and this is very important, the films of that period were made by disillusioned intellectuals. not meatheaded, petulant antagonists who haven't got a clue about the artistry of the cinematic medium. Where is the subtext? Where are the genuine shocks? Where is the invention? This film is utterly, inarguably appalling. Anyone that doesn't agree, I'd wager, has problems when attempting to spell their own name."

I was excited to see it, Jack seemed like a cool guy and I love Fran Kranz, but I had no idea I was in for such a treat. I'm not really sure if treat is the right word to use, this film is a lot of things, but it might be a little too dark to be considered a treat. The performances, writing, direction, and production design are all flawless. If you like movies like Killer Joe and Fargo, this film is for you."

It makes them want to cry when every reputable critic has pointed out the glaring flaws with this mess.  Blatant ripping off every other summer blockbuster that came from it including Independence Day, Avatar, and Transformers while trying desperately to be all serious like The Dark Knight.  Superman is a fantasy film and not a dark grim ripoff of Batman which it also tries but fails badly.  Worst movie of 2013 and any followup or sequel to this tripe will be worse."
1,regular,1,"The film was technically ahead of its time but Spielberg's story writing not better than an amateur. It could have been an interesting film if Spielberg didn't fill the plot with unnecessary scenes. He should have  tried to create better connections between the events and characters. Some scene  goes one forever and then story jumps into a completely different scene. Spielberg doesn't want to answer many question about the aliens ,thing it would make the film sophisticates.However it fails  that intellectual touch in 2001:Space Odyssey."

There were quite a few parts that I enjoyed of the book, but they were either changed, or just left out! Even though a film of the whole book would be quite long, if you want to do something, do it properly! At least Saphira was cute for a while."

Well this is a film that truly deserves a 0. Adam Sandler has never produced a good film, so I didn't go into the film with high hopes. But to see such talented actors such as Al Pacino being in this is unbelievable. All of the jokes are basically people just falling down/getting hurt and racist jokes (this is probably the most racist film I have ever seen), The film has WAY to much product placement (the whole film feels like a Dunkin Doughnuts commercial, and when the go onto the cruise, it feels like an actual commercial for that cruise.) My final major problem I had with this film was the amount of celebrities appearing in the film just for a paycheck and actually doing nothing. (Johnny Depp just had to sit there) Jack and Jill is an awful film with bad acting, bad jokes, and terrible and awkward moments that tries to make you care for the characters. Do not watch this. It is awful"
1,regular,1,"Watched the trailer for Ghost Dimension and remembered this horrible mess. Who came up with the idea for this movie, it's generic plot and its non scary moments, actually one jump scare got me at the end but other than that it doesn't even feel like a paranormal activity movie or horror movie in general. The one thing that at least kinda saved the movie was when he goes to this house and teleports him to one certain place that was in 1 and 3 but it also sinks the franchise PA-GD better be good or this franchise needs to end"

Jack and Jill is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Sandler is obnoxious as Jill! His voice is whiny and he's not much better as Jack, making this film excruciating to watch because he's in every scene and the supporting characters are completely irrelevant. Oscar winner and 9 time Oscar nominee, Al Pacino, has a major (shameful) cameo role; he should sue Sandler for using him in this dog sh film. Consider yourself warned!"

1,regular,1,"Part 1 was fantastic and a truly different comedy movie, definitely and defiantly better than other comedies of a similar genre. Part 2 was decent (even though they recycled the same exact plot from Part 1), due to an impressive performance by Ken Jeong. How many times can you repeat the same exact jokes and plot? To be honest, this comedy lacked momentum and had lazy acting with somewhat poor production values. And yes, I know how hard it is to make a 'good' comedy sequel, let alone a prequel."

0,discrepant,1,"Batman: The Dark Knight Rises is a movie that will blow you away&gt; This is a satisfying end to arguable the best superhero movie franchise in history. This movie is grander in scope than the last two, has a sense of what it is, and has superb acting. Tom Hardy as Bane is no Joker, but is a talented actor that is a good choice for Bane. Anne Hathaway surprised me with her great acting as Catwoman, Marion Cotillard was the memorable Miranda Tate, and Michael Caine and definitely Christian Bale have never been better in the franchise. The best new character for me was Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, who gave a great performance. The story excelled at showing that Batman is human like us, not some Superman or Green Lantern, but a guy just like us, even if he has a bit more money. This is a great end to a great trilogy, and I think it outdoes Spider-Man and the Avengers for best superhero movie of the year."
0,discrepant,1,"In chronicling the travails of the Brazilian underclass, ""Fast Five"" is no ""Pixote"", the Hector Babenco neo-realist classic about lost childhood, but at least it pays lip service to the poor, which is marginally better than an amoral filmmaker such as Michael Bay, whose infamous chase sequence involving Hummers laying waste to a Cuban hillside shantytown in ""Bad Boys 2"", makes almost no filmic reference to the impoverished people who reside there. The human collateral damage caused by the SUVs goes unacknowledged by both the driver(Will Smith) and the passenger(Martin Lawrence), because a third-world citizen isn't the equivalent of a first-world one. So even though the U.S. feds(led by Dwayne Johnson), in ""Fast Five"", chase Dominic Toretto and his friends through an honest-to-goodness favela, firing at will without any self-consciousness about nicking an innocent bystander, the exotic on-location set is not utilized merely as background for a standard Hollywood-style shootout. On the lam from the law, Vince, last seen in ""The Fast and the Furious"", has been hiding out in the Rio slums for the past ten years, and during the interim, he marries a Brazilian local and fathers a child with her. Likewise, since Canada is too easy, Dom, a recently escaped convict, joins his old childhood friend, along with ex-cop Brian O'Conner and Dom's sister Mia, who are also wanted for their part in the bus hijacking that frees the bald linchpin en route to a federal penitentiary. Despite the fact that all the Portuguese-speaking parts are assigned to crooked cops and criminals, the filmmaker does attempt to put a human face on the favela inhabitants. When Rosa allows the fairer Toretto to put little Nico to sleep, both the mother and child are signified as people through Mia's Americanism. By proxy, they're no longer just ordinary Brazilians. And then there's Elena, a neighborhood girl-turned-cop who, initially anyway, is seemingly the only honest law officer in all of Rio de Janerio. More interaction with the visiting fugitives would further distance the Rio locals from the same filmic life of faceless anonymity that confronts other third-world denizens whose respective countries serve as a backdrop for some crisis which often doesn't include them. While ""Fast Five"" has just enough cultural sensitivity to stave off comparisons with a Michael Bay production, it still, however, bears the unmistakable stench of American imperialism. (For instance, the scene where the ersatz ""Ocean's Eleven""-like outfit brazenly race in police cars.) The filmmaker wants the moviegoer to care about Rosa, but not necessarily her countrymen. We never get to meet them. When Mia goes to an open market, her visit is cut short before she gets the chance to talk with a vendor, somebody other than Rosa who'd give the favela populace a collective identity. Thanks to Vince, the ambushing of Mia, orchestrated by Reyes(the unofficial ""governor"" of Rio), goes awry, so the quota on Brazilian kidnappings, at least one a day according to the Jason Kohn documentary ""Manda Bala(Send a Bullet)"", gets left to some other Portuguese goon and his henchmen. Contrary to Brazil's reputation as a glamorous tourist destination, the South American country with the seventh highest GDP is plagued by high crime rates, nefarious government officials, and a disproportionate amount of poor people. In ""Manda Bala"", a frog farmer, who was thought to be involved in a money-laundering scheme with then-Governor Jader Barbalho, tells the camera proudly that he chose the frogs, after his wife issued him an ultimatum which put the small businessman's aquaculture business in opposition with their marriage. The money was just too good. Love, both the brotherly and romantic kind, also takes a backseat in ""Fast Five"", as well, since Mia is allowed to go out alone, unescorted, without notice. Dominic and Brian are too busy mulling over their potential hundred-million dollar payday. This cast of characters were a whole lot more likable when they were rebels without a cause, mere small-time crooks who'd boost semi trucks at great risk for the incommensurate payoff of DVD players in the Rob Cohen original. By sequestering the thieves from the natives, the ugliness of their greed will go unnoticed by most moviegoers, who are conditioned to root for the good guys, or at the very least, the anti-heroes. Sure, they give Vince's widow a cut of the money, but that's a mere pittance in lieu of the innumerable poverty-stricken Brazilians who wallow in abject destitution. It's one thing to steal from Americans on domestic soil, but it's a whole other thing to steal from the people of a developing country. ""Fast Five"" is a film of its time. This updating of Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Eleven"" very much captures the zeitgeist of the post-economic collapse. These criminals don't give a fck about who they steal from, as long as they get paid."
0,discrepant,1,"Bigger, Stronger, Faster has been one of the most interesting documentaries I have seen recently. Not interesting in the sense that the film maker presented a valid look into the hypocrisy of criticizing steroid use, but because he unknowingly created a film about his family's struggle with steroid use. This film is definitely one sided in favor of steroids and the way it's presented leaves you feeling like the primary goal for the film maker was to justify his brothers' use of steroids. I even suspected near the end that the film maker was still on the needle. Interviews are typically in favor of steroid use and even a majority of the people being interviewed are on steroids. The logic defending steroids in this film really holds no weight since it could be easily used to defend everything from crack to the behavior of financial institutions that caused the recession. So is it still cheating if everyone is doing it? Would you jump off a bridge if everyone was doing it?"

1,discrepant,0,"The Mysteries of Lisbon are not so much mysteries as they are a series of conversations which always lead to some sort of revelation.  These revelations are melodramatic punch lines with interlocking characters continuously finding out who their parents are, where they came from, the results of lost loves, and everything in between.  If the script was written in a linear fashion with no time jumps or flashbacks, there would be no mysteries; it would just be a meandering retelling of Romeo and Juliet (and all of their cousins). The word meandering sounds harsh and an indictment of a script which does not know where it is going.  However, I mean meandering as in there are multiple lead characters to follow and each of them has a very complicated past which takes its time to tell.  The Mysteries of Lisbon is four and a half hours long; the director threw out accepted norms for audience patience in favor of showing the whole story.  It is based on an 1854 novel by the Portuguese author Camilo Castelo Branco and it appears it was filmed in an unabridged fashion.

Just try to compare recent Man of Steel and Pacific Rim. But 3D effects are very nice, I almost felt snow falling on my head, plus one point for that.

Still they do a good job of developing characters, and the final quarter of the film delivers.   Great moments of fan-service.   Great setup for a sequel.   Not as bad as critics say, especially if you ARE a warcraft fan on any level."

0,mixed,0,"Personally I thought this movie was going to be terrible, but every part of the movie seemed meticulous. I wanted a Superman movie that didn't cover his origin story but here it doesn't feel like an origin story because it takes place during the same day. What made me angry was everytime superman got tinto a fought he destroyed a lot of buildings and it took away the fact that he is a vigilante. Also it feels that superman evolves as a fighter which makes you way more invested into the character of superman."
0,mixed,0,"If you like a good thriller, this is the sort of film that will entertain and engage you, but do little else. Whilst The Accountant features some great performances and some moderately interesting thrills, it’s also a bit of a let-down when it comes to the overall mystery, which gets more and more convoluted and confused as the film progresses, making it feel a lot more like a slow trudge to the finish than a proper thriller should be.However, this isn’t necessarily a bad film, and the main reason for that is the performances. Above all, Ben Affleck is amazing in the lead role. Playing a genius man with autism, he’s both likable and exciting, but also gives off a brooding and intimidating intensity that makes his character far more interesting, providing the majority of the film’s overall mystery.What’s more is that he suits the wide range of genres in this film very well. His dramatic intensity is second to none, but as he proved with his performance in Batman v Superman, he’s actually a very good action star, and does a great job when the film moves away from its slower, more dialogue-based intrigue.Alongside Affleck, there’s a heap of A-listers in the supporting roles. Whilst not all of them are so impressive (the likes of Anna Kendrick and Cynthia Addai-Robinson aren’t the most engaging to watch), J.K. Simmons is excellent in providing emotional intrigue in a very calm and quiet role, whilst Jon Bernthal and John Lithgow also impress in smaller roles.For the most part, the performances are the best thing about The Accountant. However, I have to say that I really enjoyed everything about the opening act. Promising a cerebral and patient thriller, director Gavin O’Connor does well to set up the various plots that will all eventually come to a head, thanks to a confident and consistently gritty style (in the vein of the TV show Homeland), whilst the screenplay plants a whole host of seeds for future excitement that got me very interested.However, following the captivating first act, the entire film begins to take a dive. O’Connor continues his gritty style well, but the mixing of intense, dialogue-based thrills and big-budget shoot-outs doesn’t really fit all that well, and whilst Ben Affleck manages to bridge the genres well, the rest of the film feels a little stuck in the wilderness with regards to what sort of film it wants to be.The biggest problem, though, is the way the plot becomes so increasingly convoluted and messy as the film goes on. Whilst the plethora of characters and side plots early on gives the promise of various thrills, The Accountant ultimately becomes incredibly inconsistent in its focus and pacing of those stories.In short, we spend far too long focused on one story or other (often up to twenty minutes without seeing any other characters), and the film unfortunately begins to take on an anthology style, ruining the overall story arc’s intensity and mystery. As a result, I was left bewildered as to what was really going on, and as the pacing begins to worsen as the film goes on, it feels like a longer and longer watch, offering little more in terms of intrigue and unpredictability.Overall, whilst I was impressed by many elements of this movie, I was ultimately disappointed. The central performance by Ben Affleck is brilliant, and the entire first act is enthralling, but the way that the story takes such a dive as the film goes on, becoming more and more convoluted, and as a result more and more uninteresting and difficult to follow, was a huge shame to see."

0,factual,0,"Although divorces in Japan continue to be rare, relatively speaking, by western standards, the current rate now stands above 2%, a figure that was unheard of when Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story wowed international audiences around the world. The 1953 film about a provincial old couple's pilgrimage to the big city provokes sympathy for the mother and father, who are so frail, so gentle, and yet are treated so badly by their urbanized son and daughter. Since Koichi, a doctor, and Shige, a beautician, are so frugal when it comes to spending time and money on the aging parents, they delegate their filial duties to a widowed sister-in-law, who seemingly loves them the best, despite not being a blood relative. Somewhat shocking for Japanese, the adult children don't respect their elders, especially the father, just like Biff and Happy, who barely tolerate their old man, Willy Loman, in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. Miller invites the audience to loathe Willy, whereas Shukishi is mostly purviewed as a sympathetic figure, despite being a drunkard and womanizer in his prime, as was Loman. In the bar, we see for ourselves, as aforementioned by Tomi, how Shukishi can really throw back the sake. Joined by his imbibing companions, an old friend notices how a barmaid resembles the geisha they once knew. Did his children know? Biff knew. Biff, the golden boy, who didn't live up to a father's expectations, just like Koichi, a mere ""small neighborhood doctor"". When Shukishi arrives at the beauty parlor in an inebriated state, the oldest daughter, for all intents and purposes, is being treated to a reenactment of her childhood. When Shige, in an earlier scene, pokes fun at her mother's weight, cruelly dredging up an old story about how her heft once broke a chair, you see her latent anger rise to the surface, in regard to a possibly horrid childhood. A grudge, unfairly held against a mother, whose daughter should know that divorce wasn't a social norm so easily practiced back in post-war Japan. But times have changed. Koki and Ohshiro are the children of a broken home in I Wish, the children of parents who, unlike generations past, are no longer adhered to outmoded concepts like shame, where divorce is concerned, and leave their marital problem unreconciled. This modern Japan, to a small degree, can be glimpsed in Good Morning, Ozu's 1959 film about two brothers who acquire a television set of their own by giving mom and dad the silent treatment. Unusual for its time, when fathers wielded control over his domain, the children get their way. The Americanization of the Japanese character through a western signifier like the television, in a sense, directly influences the broken marriage in I Wish, as another American institution, rock and roll, and its main symbol, the electric guitar, tears a family apart, when Kenji chooses a music career over his domestic obligations. Over dinner, the mother's tear-stained protestation over her husband's egocentric trajectory go unheeded. Rather than subjugate herself to a man's whim though, she calls it quits, and rejects the precarious future often associated with being a struggling musician's wife; a woman who would have to make do without the amenities of middle-class respectability. Women in Japan, arguably, have come a longer way than their American analogues. Not once does Kyoko's mother encourage her daughter to acquiesce toward Kenji's bohemian inclinations. Her wish is granted, vicariously. The mother, quite pointedly, gets in a subtle dig at her husband, when she apologizes to Kyoko for not having enough money to stave off the daughter's necessity to find work, implying that the woman married badly: a drinker. Similarly, in Tokyo Story, Noriko, married only in the abstract sense to Shoji, a soldier at war, missing in action and presumed dead, is still expected to mourn the old couple's son like a dutiful wife, a limbo state created by the trappings of customary tradition. She can't even divorce a ghost. Finally, prior to Tomi's sudden death, while in Tokyo, the mourning period is lifted from the in-laws, a directive seconded by Shukishi after the funeral, just before Noriko leaves for the train station. Lauded by the old man for her loyalty, it's more than a humble mien that causes Noriko to deflect his praise. For enduring the same bad behavior, passed down from father to son, the widow is congratulated, sojourning on as she did like any good Japanese wife, seemingly, without complaint. But did Noriko wish for a divorce? The widow confesses, ""Really, I'm quite selfish,"" but she didn't have the same liberties as Kyoko, the same freedom to pack a suitcase as retaliation for a husband's shortcomings. In I Wish, the brothers use the metaphysics of passing trains to reunite their parents, whereas Kyoko's father bakes karukan cakes, as a way of turning back time, when a man's actions were sacrosanct. They wish."

0,mixed,0,"The original Ghostbusters movie was one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie pales in comparison. I did not go into the theater with high expectations. The beginning of the movie is kind of boring due to the slow pace. I have nothing against a nearly full women cast, but it did have a really feminine kind of feel to it which it every much different to the first movie, it felt more like a ""chick-flick"" than an action movie to some degree. I wish they made the characters a little more gender neutral or less ""stereotypical girly"". I did enjoy the African American Women's character a bit more however. The female version of ""Egon"" kind of lacked in character, the original Egon was a believable nerd, this one was just a bit of an oddball that didn't have much to say but in a way that was not believable. She wasthe subject of a humourous jokes, mostly prop comedy which did make me laugh sometimes. The jokes were hit and miss. I did find some of the joke funny and burst into laughter, other ones, particularly the potty jokes involving speech about a women's genitals, feel flat, they were not funny to me and no one in the theatre around me appeared to laugh at those either. This is to the original Ghostbusters movie kind of what MacGruber is to MacGyverr. Really this should have been marketed as a parody of the original Ghostbusters movie than a reboot since that is what it really is. I did enjoy the movie enough that I didn't hate it so I've given it a 7, slightly above average rating. I did like it better than Ghostbusters II but that one was a flop too so that is not saying much."
0,mixed,1,"Everyone remembers as a kid wishing for a different life, or different parents. The movie “Coraline” is a very unique movie And you can tell that these producers put a lot of work into this movie. I thought that this was a movie that is different from most other movies that I have seen. “Coraline” has a very eventful storyline, it gives off a sort of dark feeling and leaves you in suspense throughout the whole movie. Laika Entertainment also did a great job in casting as well.“Coraline” is very creative and has some very precise details that I found interesting. For an example, the setting, Ashlynn, Oregon was settled around 150 years ago. Look out for a part in the movie where they mention that in the movie as well, you can tell that these people did some serious research. The movie starts off by Coraline (Dakota Fanning)  moving to a new house called the Pink Palace Apartments and she is not exactly excited about leaving her friends behind. Coralline is quickly introduced to some of her next door neighbors. Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.) , the next door neighbor, is a young boy who lives with his grandmother. Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane) , her other next door neighbor, is a retired acrobat that works with circus mice and helps her along the way. The ladies downstairs to her apartment also play a big role in the story. Coraline’s parents ( John Hodgman and Teri Hatcher) work all day for a flower catalogue and they never spend time with their daughter. All Coraline wants is to have a loving family and some nice friends to play with. Coraline soon realizes throughout this movie that there is no perfect family.This movie has its pros and cons. One thing I disliked about “Coraline” is that I wouldn’t say it is appropriate for little kids. There are a few scenes that would most absolutely be scary for them, such as a few jump scares. Another thing I didn't like about this movie is that the storyline is very confusing and I definitely had to watch this more than once to actually understand what was even going on. One pro I had for this movie is that it had a good theme, which I won’t spoil for you. Another thing I enjoyed about this movie is that it left me at the edge of my seat. I had no idea what was going to happen next! I have one more thing that impressed me. The animation is just wonderful. I cannot believe how seamless it is. This certain type of animation is labor intensive and so hard to do, and this movie had great animation.Even though this movie is rated PG, I would recommend this movie to kids over eight years old. Due to some very scary and inappropriate parts. If you are really wanting to have your child watch this, maybe you should watch it first just to be safe. Overall, I thought that this film was pretty decent, but I do believe that it could’ve been better."
0,mixed,0,"A very fun action move to watch with friends but at the end of the day that's all it really is. The film has what i would consider to be one of the most overrated story lines of all time. Most of the characters are never fully developed, and this includes the Main Lead. If the main character was not the titular Max you would have absolutely no reason to care about him. Furiosa is developed the most out of all the characters in fact she hijacks the story so often I started to think this was just a movie they threw max in to. Honestly I found the story ultimately boring and a standard predictable ride for a traditional good vs. evil flick. Does this mean you shouldn't watch the film, No, it still remains to have incredible set pieces and very entertaining events spring throughout despite the lackluster Characters and plot."
