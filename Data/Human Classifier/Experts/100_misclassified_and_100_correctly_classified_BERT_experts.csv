1,regular,1,What little plot there is involves drug-running and is just about as disposable as everything in this paltry excuse for a movie.
1,regular,1,"Mostly loud and graceless, despite some arresting hyperbolic visuals that deserve an action film of actual soul and purpose. It's simply too generic at heart to justify director Schwentke's delirious, sidewinding, arcing, snap-zooming and whip-panning anti-gravity camerawork. "
0,regular,0,"The movie blows a fresh wind of disrespect, high drama and lush romanticism through that stolidly middlebrow subgenre, the period drama."
0,regular,0,Funny and sweet and guaranteed to flood you with good feeling.
0,regular,0,"Though there are occasional stumbles along the 1,100-mile hike, the peaks in Wild make the journey more than worth it."
0,regular,0,Promised Land is an involving and timely tale that explores the changing nature and complex challenges of rural life.
0,regular,0,The movie survives beautifully both as an elegant thriller and as a study of the twisted infantilism that shapes the fanatic heart.
1,regular,1,A total disaster.
1,regular,1,"Shots of blood and naked bodies clash bizarrely with Coppola's more quaint and engaging notions; the result may be intended as a dialectical encounter, but seems more like a head-on collision."
1,regular,1,"It is funny at times – the teams for dodgeball break down into ""popular"" and ""unpopular"" – but Chicken Little is painful to watch for all ages."
0,regular,0,It's so earnest it hurts.
0,regular,0,"Anyone who cares about ravishing filmmaking, superb acting and movies willing to dive into the mystery of unconditional love will leave this dark romance both shaken and invigorated."
1,regular,1,"There is humor in the familiar just waiting to be rehashed for new generations, and A Guy Thing surely isn't the last stupid leave-'em-at-the-altar film we're likely to see."
1,regular,1,"It's a syrupy, downbeat film."
1,regular,1,I could not see it as anything more than a giant bore that presents viewers with the most familiar plot devices imaginable but fails to present them in a way that makes them worth sitting through once again.
0,regular,0,The Red Turtle benefits from being open to all sorts of possibilities and interpretations because we sense that Dudok de Wit respects our imaginings. He allows them to take shape right alongside his own.
0,regular,0,"It's agony, in a rewarding way, to squirm and cringe and groan through an ordeal so realistically re-created. "
1,regular,1,"A snooze, despite all the sex and other gunplay. "
0,regular,0,"By the climax all concerns have gone out the window, as Vigalondo delivers an operatic finale that feels both earned and genuinely cathartic. For better and worse, you won't have seen a movie like Colossal before, and you won't again. And that, in itself, is a strong recommendation. "
1,regular,1,A dull but harmless big-screen comedy aimed at the youngest movie goers.
1,regular,1,"Sex Tape settles for violence when violent slapstick, a lot harder to finesse, was the implicit goal of the picture."
0,regular,0,"Hoffman and the film are terrific. Supported by the eminent Catherine Keener (as author Harper Lee) and Chris Cooper (as detective Alvin Dewey), Hoffman begins with a dead-on impersonation of Capote that soon becomes a kind of channeling as the audience comes to see this American tragedy through his eyes."
0,regular,0,Irresistibly bleak appeal.
1,regular,1,"Little kidniks with an appetite for zap-pow silliness might find this to their liking. Everyone else, beware."
0,regular,0,"None of this amounts to anything more than goofy fun, but that's what the ads promise, and the movie delivers."
1,regular,1,There's something reassuring about the fact that The Avengers is so rotten: proof yet again that people with piles of money can hire wizard production designers but can't fake class.
1,regular,1,"Criminal's absence of style, the lack of relish the filmmakers take in the material's inherent ludicrousness, is a failure of conviction."
0,regular,0,"The film is shot with handheld cameras in the standard mockumentary style, but the content is often hilarious, especially when the trolls show up. There's also a marvelous deadpan comic performance by Otto Jespersen as a troll-hunter and tireless dispenser of troll lore."
1,regular,1,"If not better, a Part II always has to be bigger. In the case of The Hangover Part II, that means raunchier, nastier, darker. It also means much more predictable, which is ruinous."
0,regular,0,A movie whose story may be even more innovative than the superreal solidity of the animated characters.
0,regular,0,Stuffed to the gills with Perry's mix of the sacred and the silly and a serious dose of self-help for the self-absorbed.
1,regular,1,"Its blind reverence toward the Russian mythos is so grandiose that it becomes impossible to rescue it from self-importance, and as such President Putin would likely give it two big thumbs up."
1,regular,1,Even young would-be botanists will find this charmless animated adventure as exciting as watching grass grow.
1,regular,1,"Thrills and drama are left standing on the tarmac in Boarding Gate a limp, sleazy inanity by renowned French critic cum erratic helmer Olivier Assayas."
0,regular,0,"Everything I've ever dreamed of in a crazy comedy.  It's close to pure farce, yet its laughs are grounded in loneliness, impotence, self-loathing, and that most discomfiting of vices to dramatize: envy.  The action is surreal, the emotions are violently real."
0,regular,0,Mutants abound as each episode trips the light fantastic.
1,regular,1,"Dream House also manages to commit a cardinal thriller sin: casting well-known actors in ostensibly inconsequential roles, which in this case reveals the real culprit before the mystery proper has even begun."
0,regular,0,"Hail, Caesar! is a lot of fun, and beautifully crafted, too. One to savour."
0,regular,0,"Van Bebber's film is tough, difficult, sporadically brilliant cinema, to be sure, and I doubt he'd have had it any other way. And as strange as it may sound, neither should the audience. "
1,regular,1,Thoroughly inept in just about every aspect.
0,regular,0,The movie's pleasures draw on old-fashioned Italian neo-realist simplicity.
1,regular,1,"Tacky-looking, incoherent, badly acted and hopelessly directed disaster is easily the dullest adventure film of 2000."
0,regular,0,"Half a century after ""Wait Until Dark"" pitted a blind Audrey Hepburn against the three crooks trying to get into her apartment, along comes Don’t Breathe to successfully invert its scenario. "
1,regular,1,"A ridiculous fusion of ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Glee"" that is so incredibly dumb that it is almost, but never quite, scary to behold."
1,regular,1,"Woodley has been first-rate in everything she’s been in, particularly the “Divergent” series. But there’s something about her performance here that feels like the sincere and dutiful dispersal of medicine."
1,regular,1,Lawrence is so ON that he appears to be gunning for clockwork bursts of audience approval.
0,regular,0,Just a plain old fun movie.
0,regular,0,"It is a thoughtful film, a serious one, and one that is sneakily affecting."
0,regular,0,"Beautifully acted and handsomely mounted, this gorgeous period piece is an intelligent and intriguing exploration of ""the dark arts"" -- less dependent on mere hocus-pocus than on the convincing journey of the soul undertaken by its hero."
1,regular,1,"This last angle had us thinking back to “Risky Business,” as did the Chicago setting and the reveling gone off the rails. Here, though, there’s no edge to the wildness, nothing memorable."
1,regular,1,"One of the least appealing movies I've seen in a while.... When a member of the audience belched loudly, that got the biggest laugh of the day. [17 June 1986, p.E26]"
0,regular,0,"Let Me In is not as fantastic as ""Let the Right One In,"" which you should rent immediately. But it is undeniably powerful and made with obvious admiration and respect for the source material."
1,regular,1,"It's possible Hill has a style, of sorts. But he doesn't work from the heart, or from the gut, as a good comedy director generally needs to. He operates from one guiding question: ""How disturbing can we make this sh?"""
1,regular,1,"The four leads are nothing if not game, and actually earn  respect, along with a fair amount of sympathy, for their uninhibited willingness to go to extremes. But there are limits to what they can do to dispel the overall sense of mounting desperation as the gross-out tomfoolery grows ever more tedious."
0,regular,0,A glorious late-summer pendant.
0,regular,0,"This is a movie about draining, tenderizing and chopping up the audience emotionally."
0,regular,0,It does what it desires to do - it suspensefully squeezes the sweat out of the pores - but the salty stench it leaves behind in the persona of Annie Wilkes is a residue that transcends its intentions. [30 Nov 1990]
0,regular,0,"Not just one of the great racing movies of all time, but a virtuoso feat of filmmaking in its own right, elevated by two of the year’s most compelling performances. "
1,regular,1,Franchise morphs into generic slasher series without Jigsaw.
0,regular,0,"A fascinating movie that, if you are able to make the leap it asks of you at about the three-quarter mark, will give you something to think and talk about for days. One thing is certain: It isn't predictable."
1,regular,1,"Shove people into categories, then into a film like Think Like a Man, and it's a recipe for tedium."
0,regular,0,"A remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending, which is just the point."
1,regular,1,"It is really not about anything at all except the mistakes, pitfalls and dumb decisions that plague the career of talented but misguided Australian actor Guy Pearce in his attempts to become an American film star."
0,regular,0,What makes this nominee for the best-foreign-film Oscar singular among Holocaust movies is the way it characterizes the banality of life underground.
0,regular,0,This exercise in racked nerves makes most of the year's thrillers look like flailing maniacs by comparison.
0,regular,0,"As Kym, Hathaway runs an astonishing gamut of emotions, from anger to fragility and from hurt to regret - without ever seeming actress-y, like Nicole Kidman. Start clearing that mantelpiece, Anne."
0,regular,0,The mesmerizing narrative recounts a media circus of unrivaled malignance.
1,regular,1,"Whatever ideas Mohawk had behind it, whatever the filmmaker saw in the cast, especially Ms. Horn (think Grace Slick circa “White Rabbit”) not much of a movie came out of the effort."
0,regular,0,Those who deplore Beavis and Butt-Head are confusing the messengers with the message.
0,regular,0,"Mr. Kurosawa, a prolific and skilled genre master, spins this parable with a light, nimble touch, punctuating heavy passages of exposition with punchy, modest action sequences and snatches of incongruously bouncy music. "
1,regular,1,"This is less a caper than a trudge; a linear adventure that proceeds in fits and starts, with few surprises and fewer laughs. There's barely even a hangover."
0,regular,0,Redford blows the dust off a 35-year-old scandal about rigged TV quiz shows and makes it snap with up-to-the-minute relevance.
0,regular,0,"A mesmerizing film that is the most stunning, tempestuous love story in a decade or two of movie making."
0,regular,0,"The sort of suspenseful, old-fashioned war movie that should particularly appealing to older viewers, provided they don't mind reading subtitles."
1,regular,1,"A second-rate adaptation of the second-rate Choderlos de Laclos novel: two hours of pretty people sitting in pretty rooms and talking about sex. [23 Dec 1988, A& L, p.19]"
1,regular,1,"Right up to its simplistic ending, the film is pleased to regurgitate the contrived tropes of the genre without ever honestly addressing the ethics of romantic boundaries."
1,regular,1,"Newsies is a live-action musical, but it's only barely alive. Call it ""Snoozies."" [10 Apr 1992]"
0,regular,0,"With dialogue kept to a minimum, cinematographer Agnés Godard confirms her status as one of the most extraordinary visual artists working today."
1,regular,1,"Stiller strives to be a wild and wacky villain, Vaughn endeavors to be a likable and average hero, and both fall flat on their faces, like everything else in this unspeakably stupid comedy."
1,regular,1,"It's all neat and sweet and one-dimensional, more the moral to a story than a story."
1,regular,1,"A sweet and sloppy jumble of fantasy, sentimentality, comedy and soul-searching that feels like a sitcom that never got past the pilot stage. "
1,regular,1,An unsalvageable wreck.
1,regular,1,"After several scenes of this tacky nonsense, you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions, especially because Half Past Dead is like ""The Rock"" on a Wal-Mart budget. And the marked-down price tags are incredibly visible."
1,regular,1,"8 1/2 Women is a collage-y, self-reflexive sort of film that is designed to shock but more often just annoys."
0,regular,0,"The film mixes unashamed kitsch, thrilling airfight scenes and dark historical drama. But what gives it a special charge is its portrait of the Czech RAF group: what happened to them before, during and after the war."
1,regular,1,"Braveheart is too much, too late."
1,regular,1,"The movie lacks any sense of subcultural specificity, though it has a superabundant country music score. [22 Apr 1997]"
1,regular,1,A curiously loud and ugly beast of a sequel.
1,regular,1,Vacant and pointless.
0,regular,0,A potential cultural juggernaut.
0,regular,0,"Though it's become almost redundant to say so, major kudos go to Leigh for actually casting people who look working-class; you'd be hard-pressed to get an American studio to go along with that, even though Leigh alumni often become famous."
0,regular,0,"Results in about the nicest movie you could ask for at the holidays: a gently funny, sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good, that is to say, entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp, overmanipulative Hollywood practices."
0,regular,0,"A Royal Affair is basically a good-looking set of historical Cliffs Notes. There, is however, one excellent reason to see it: Folsgaard, who by the end has made his betrayed and bereft Christian into a figure of genuine tragedy."
1,regular,1,"Unfortunately, this movie needed an attractive, irresistibly charismatic performer to give us some reason for watching. Madonna is made up to look like Eva, but this is hardly enough to carry the movie."
1,regular,1,Feels patently inauthentic.
1,regular,1,"On paper, this sounded like a winner. In reality? We have met the Enemy at the multiplex, and he's silly. [08 Feb 1991, p.4D]"
1,regular,1,"Poor old Mr. Magoo should have been allowed to rest in piece. This film suggests that when you loot a crypt, you're likely to find a corpse."
1,regular,1,The movie is somewhat below average. The plot doesn't always hold together.
1,regular,1,"A convoluted, pointless thriller that wastes the considerable talent of Max von Sydow."
1,regular,1,"Ultimately it's an ugly, insipid rape fantasy, nothing more."
0,regular,0,A well-orchestrated nightmare that keeps you on edge until the very end.
0,regular,0,Many inspirational sports movies provide only junk food for thought; this one contains some authentic reflections of sport in the civil rights era.
1,regular,1,"For a movie that’s ostensibly about casting off the shackles of old age and embracing excitement in life, there isn’t a single moment here that feels original or spontaneous."
1,regular,1,Doesn't make the movie worth watching -- even if you're monstrously bored.
0,regular,0,"It's a horror flick, and a creepily good one, that also functions as an allegory of the war that still haunts Spain seven decades later."
1,regular,1,"All the advance signs looked discouraging, but I still kept thinking: How bad could a comedy starring Eddie Murphy and Jeff Goldblum really be? Well, let's put it this way … you won't ever hear me asking that particular question again."
0,regular,0,Depp deserves kudos for fashioning an original and outlandish if occasionally menacing character.
0,regular,0,"It’s like a lost John Hughes movie with Irish brogues and cars that just happen to drive on the other side of the road. It’s also, sadly, exactly the kind of sweet little film that too often gets buried in a box office ruled by broader comedies and bloated superhero epics"
0,regular,0,"At once a powerful psychological thriller and a haunting allegory, The Return marks an auspicious feature debut for helmer Andrey Zvyagintsev."
0,regular,0,"The movie belongs to Moretz, whose sensational performance will be talked about for years. Her scenes with Cage, who wears a Batsuit and uses a voice borrowed from Adam West, are a hoot."
0,regular,0,"At nearly six hours, pic's extreme length lets Giordana and screenwriters Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli build up a novelistic rhythm, pulling the audience so deeply and forcefully into their story that it becomes like a enveloping dream; when it's over, parting with the characters is truly sweet and sorrowful."
1,regular,1,"Schwartzman steals Slackers without much effort, but it's not worth the theft."
0,regular,0,"Split is funnier, campier, and more freewheeling than anything its writer-director has done — slightly overlong, but reminiscent of Brian De Palma films like ""The Fury"" and ""Femme Fatale"" in its refusal to be boring."
1,regular,1,"Yes, it's all a harmless lark. Which is why the only thing that could redeem this sour patch of candy-coated crud would be a final shot of Earth exploding."
0,regular,0,"It's a magical, beguiling wonder."
0,regular,0,"It's a modest film in most respects, but Albert Finney as Alfie is a man of great importance indeed, reminding us again that he's one of the most towering talents in film today."
1,regular,1,It's a schlock melodrama dolled up in arty frontier vestments.
0,regular,0,"Annihilation is more than mere visuals and it will shock, fascinate and haunt whatever screen it’s watched on."
0,regular,0,"This family-friendly outing captures the story's human snowball effect with a measure of sly, satirical wit, if also an excess of boilerplate subplots and jokey '80s details. "
0,regular,0,"There's scarcely a scene in which the actors, action and sound track aren't cranked up to maximum intensity."
0,regular,0,"A spruced-up version has been re-released after 22 years, and the addition of 43 minutes means the story really has room to breathe."
0,regular,0,"Director Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival”) delivers a moody, visually stunning celebration of existential angst. Not that he skimps on the kind of mayhem that’s de rigueur these days, but you have to wait for it — and wait for it. But when it does arrive, it’s awesome."
0,regular,0,Will be hailed for its macabre imagination and inventive farce. But it also elegantly renders an archetypal teenage tale.
0,regular,0,"Encountered in an appropriately exploratory frame of mind, it can produce something close to bliss. "
1,discrepant,0,"The result of Moskowitz's sleuthing is Stone Reader, a combination mystery, book celebration and -- sorry to say -- intrusively annoying self-portrait of the filmmaker."
0,discrepant,1,"His (LaBute's) work needs attention even at its nadir, which I hope this new film is."
0,discrepant,1,"The latest in a numbing series begun in 1978 by John Carpenter, and repeated five times since, with only a few plot and casting changes to detract from the brilliant slice-and-dice work of its masked hero. Mike may be getting older, but he can still sling a knife around like a chef at Benihana. [2 Oct 1995, p.F8]"
1,discrepant,0,"No question, watching this film is a tough go. Horror films cause less seat-squirming."
1,discrepant,0,"The interlocking stories are theoretically about people whose lives are associated; that worked in ""Crash."" Here the connections seem less immediate and significant, and so the movie sometimes seems based on a group of separate short stories."
1,discrepant,0,"It took guts to bring this story to the screen, but at its core it has the wrong stuff."
1,discrepant,0,"Ultimately comes off as curiously anecdotal, lacking the dramatic dynamism that could give Marcel Pagnol's tale new life."
1,discrepant,0,Too often goes off on a tangent with unessential anecdotes and then fails to deliver in more important areas.
0,discrepant,1,A sickly sweet family drama.
1,discrepant,0,"Alice in Wonderland is curiously devoid of metaphors and allegories about a young woman on the cusp of adulthood, about to be engaged by arrangement to a loathsome toad of a man she can barely stomach. The lack of psychological subtext is hugely disappointing."
1,discrepant,0,"By modeling its structure so closely after ""All the President's Men,"" Spotlight only draws closer attention to its lack of scope and ambition.  "
1,discrepant,0,It's a doozy of a story and so borderline ridiculous that it sounds - ta-da! - like something that could have been cooked up only by Hollywood.
0,discrepant,1,"The film's images, so continually heartrending so as to never become redundant, effectively function as visual proselytizing."
0,discrepant,1,"""Legally Blonde"" was a splashy, wide-screen near musical, a movie made in the spirit of Elle Woods herself. Legally Blonde 2 is Elle Woods' eulogy. "
1,discrepant,0,Figgis's film doesn't match its reach.
1,discrepant,0,"The cumbersome wrap-up, which follows a four-year narrative gap, seems too fanciful and bogs down what has been a stronger second hour."
1,discrepant,0,"It is an episodic, chunky film of over-explicated ideas and speculative set pieces."
1,discrepant,0,"A good third of this overblown movie consists of stunt-filled action sequences that turn a human story into something akin to Cannonball Run. That's too bad, because Goldberg's character is a terrible thing to waste. "
1,discrepant,0,"For all the hundreds of thousands of dollars being thrown around, The Gambler is much closer to a friendly game of poker with some loquacious, quick-witted friends than a glimpse at the gambling world’s dark underbelly. Neither is it a preachy moral tale."
0,discrepant,1,"If the glue holding Crash's arcs together was Paul Haggis's belief in the power of racism, this time it's love."
1,contextual,1,"If all a movie needed was a boy with abs and a gun (or slingshot), then Beyond the Reach would be a masterpiece. "
1,contextual,0,"Push any guy long enough with alcohol and aggressive masculinity, the film suggests, and you'll find an XY-chromosomed predator lurking behind the mask."
0,factual,0,"The overall effect is of something too large to fully comprehend, yet also too intimately sad to ignore, the kind of dilemma that Ai believes speaks directly to who we are as human beings — that ingrained desire to better ourselves, the right to migrate toward safety and prosperity, and the belief we’ll find solidarity in that quest."
0,factual,1,The handful of redeeming moments in Jayne Mansfield’s Car belong to Duvall in the role of a septuagenarian who finds himself more and more at odds with a changing world.
0,mixed,0,"Ultimately, Anthropoid is quite gripping, even if it feels like two movies in one."
0,factual,0,"“Shadows” has its share of lines that will be repeated by fans ad infinitum (a favorite: “Yes, now Google it”)."
1,mixed,0,"The prize for most sick-making movie I've ever seen goes to . . . that Driver's Ed film I saw when I was 16. The psychological thriller Hard Candy is right up there, though. I didn't know whether to applaud or barf."
0,mixed,0,"If you think Kevin Hart is funny — as I do — you’ll laugh frequently, as I did. If you don’t, you’re not going to this movie in the first place, are you?"
1,contextual,1,Invites the kind of judgment it condemns.
0,factual,0,"Though one gets a sense there is part of the story Marks isn't telling, we do pay attention to the man behind the curtain."
1,mixed,1,"Despite a few good scenes and ideas, and a final ten minutes that will be affecting for anyone who lived through the aftermath of the attacks on New York, the end product often feels like a standard-issue high concept romantic comedy with scaffolding of 9/11 solemnity built around it."
0,contextual,0,"The Five Obstructions clearly calls for a sequel, in which Leth would require von Trier to remake ""Dogville,"" despite Obstructions 6 through 10. "
1,mixed,0,"Ma Mere, with its sun-drenched sense of dread and band of reckless, unlikable characters, isn't very good, but that doesn't stop the actors -- especially the intrepid Huppert -- from going all the way."
1,mixed,0,"Bailed out by a few good jolts, Jurassic World gets by, barely, as a marauding-dinosaurs narrative designed for a more jaded audience than the one ""Jurassic Park"" conquered back in 1993."
1,mixed,1,"Despite its intelligent agenda, swollen heart and fabulously epic surface, amounts to a didactic banality: a white guy's politically correct lesson abroad."
1,contextual,0,Greenberg would be a heckuva movie if we could just get Greenberg out of there.
1,factual,0,"Frustratingly, though, and not a little ironically, Justman chooses to focus on the new stars when they sing, rather than on the Funk Brothers playing in the background. Just as curiously, he paints a remarkably rosy picture of the old days, overlooking the racism and exploitation the Brothers surely experienced."
1,mixed,0,"At its best, The Tree of Life makes the viewer lean forward, eager to enter Malick's own dreamy, poetic consciousness. At worst, it leads to the vague feeling that we're listening to the meanderings of someone who's not sure we're smart enough to keep up."
1,factual,1,"It makes me sick all over again just describing this--the most affecting scene in a sluggish would-be comedy that reflects the dubious state of the art of fat male comedians exploiting themselves in 1997, the year its star died."
0,factual,0,Oregon is more than a bittersweet look at a man deciding to end his life before he’s too invalid to have a say in the matter: It’s a study of how plain ol’ stubbornness can keep a family forever brimming with dysfunction.
0,mixed,0,"Is the relentlessness too much? At two and a half hours, perhaps, but inventiveness abounds."
0,contextual,1,"Ms. Ryan's lean, eagle-eyed golden girl is enough to curdle milk."
1,contextual,1,"It seems to have had the opposite effect on the director's taste, as she strives for new levels of raunchiness."
1,contextual,1,Cop Car is an instance of what happens when an airy indie filmmaker tries to “do genre” and winds up being as convincing as John Kerry putting down his demitasse and dressing up in hunting gear.
0,mixed,0,The movie’s only real drawback is that its singleminded approach sometimes omits crucial information.
1,contextual,1,"The problem with Mel Brooks these days is the same one Woody Allen would have if he kept making Bananas over and over. [30 July 1993, p.3F]"
1,mixed,1,Delpy's injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her.
0,contextual,1,The first step in getting beyond preaching to the converted is letting the other side show how wrong it might be.
0,factual,0,The Trials of Henry Kissinger serves as both a prosecution brief on the above charges and an unauthorized biography.
0,contextual,0,A madcap gem.
1,contextual,0,"If nothing else, The Cable Guy will make you think twice before trying to pick up a free movie channel. [14 June 1996, p.C]"
0,factual,0,"Free love, vegetarianism and lack of personal property are the rule."
1,contextual,1,Dick works best as a catalog of style: It's the story and the acting that are the window dressing.
1,mixed,1,"Blanchett's performance is Soderbergh's biggest mistake. He either encourages or permits her to play Lena as a Greta Garbo caricature, which is mildly amusing if you're interested in Garbo, but if you're interested in Lena and The Good German, you're out of luck."
1,contextual,0,The reason to see Chasing Mavericks is the same reason why people flock to shore locations when a hurricane approaches: the waves. This is less effective as a bio-pic of Jay Moriarty than it is as a big screen National Geographic Special.
0,mixed,0,"While the beats of the story are often stock, the picture benefits from sensitive direction by New Zealander Niki Caro (Whale Rider, North Country) and from a most appealing performance by Kevin Costner."
1,contextual,1,"A Time to Kill seems to argue that America's racial problems aren't so bad because, even in the heart of bigoted Mississippi, a black man can get away with murder."
1,mixed,0,"The only player in this tawdry round-robin game who moved or seduced me in any way was Andy’s poor, hapless Gina. Tomei’s an ordinary beauty...  But she has real screen presence and range, and her neglected wife is an artful inversion of her Oscar-winning role as Danny DeVito’s pert squeeze in ""My Cousin Vinny."""
1,contextual,1,"It seems that in the movies, at least, there is a limit to how far low expectations can take you."
1,contextual,1,"The line between priggishness and creepiness is repeatedly smudged by multihyphenate Rik Swartzwelder in Old Fashioned, a faith-based drama that looks as lovely as an expensive greeting card, but moves as slowly as a somnolent turtle."
0,mixed,0,"Whether Girl Most Likely intentionally satirizes its upending of conventions or suffers from a half-assed screenplay, the resulting hodgepodge at least livens up a clichéd premise. "
1,mixed,0,"If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Eddie Murphy has just paid himself a heartfelt compliment. Cut for cut, his Beverly Hills Cop II is almost a perfect match for the wildly successful ""Beverly Hills Cop I,"" with only the crimes and the shticks changed to protect fans of the original. It could have been written by a witty computer. That's not all bad, given the quality of the model. [20 May 1987, p.C13]"
0,mixed,0,Brisk pacing and a remarkable cast achieve the sleight-of-hand effect of making you forgive some implausible twists and a sanitized ending.
0,contextual,1,The net result is a truly numbing experience.
1,contextual,0,"At times, these singers’ versatility has kept them both regularly employed and deliberately anonymous. "
0,mixed,0,"If holes in plots bother you, Marathon Man will be maddening. But as well-crafted escapist entertainment, as a diabolical thriller, the movie works with relentless skill."
1,mixed,1,"In some ways it takes the right approach, attempting to mix moral lessons into a narrative rather than hit audiences over the head with them. But the lessons are so pat that every moment in which Pepper makes a good moral choice feels like an act of self-congratulation. "
1,undefined,0,"Director Espinosa shoots virtually everything in tight but wobbly close-up, and the human and vehicular combat often brakes right at the edge of visual incoherence. Just as often the brakes give out completely."
