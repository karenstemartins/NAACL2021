0,regular,0,"The Book of Life represents Guillermo del Toro's most hands-on foray (to date) into the realm of family friendly entertainment; this is closer in tone and sensibility to one of Tim Burton's offbeat animated films than one of Pixar's more ""vanilla"" productions."
1,regular,1,"The director Alister Grierson, not grasping that bad dialogue is sometimes best delivered quietly, encourages his actors to shout and thrash about, and so they do, like fish out of water and performers out of their depth. "
1,regular,1,The call on this one is: dead on arrival.
1,regular,1,Deeply personal and deeply silly.
1,regular,1,"It's depressingly self-conscious and turgid, and a cast that includes Dennis Hopper, David Carradine, Michael Madsen and Eric Balfour can't drag Hell Ride out of the mire."
1,regular,1,"This is sloppy filmmaking, and it's likely to wipe away whatever luster still remains to Shyamalan's reputation."
0,regular,0,"With great looks, a dandy supporting cast, a zinger-filled screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (""A Few Good Men"") and Mr. Douglas twinkling merrily in the Oval Office, The American President is sunny enough to make the real Presidency pale by comparison."
0,regular,0,"To look at Bringing Out the Dead --to look, indeed, at almost any Scorsese film--is to be reminded that film can touch us urgently and deeply."
1,regular,1,"The result is a lumbering attempt at sweet-and-saucy romance, all affected emotion and strained bad-boy humor."
0,regular,0,"The movie is full of juices that give it a healthy, pungent flow."
0,regular,0,"This is a film done right by just about every measure. The extremes of the story seep deep into your bones -- the beauty, the allure, the desperation and especially the cold in this world where life literally hangs on rope and what Mother Nature chooses to throw at you."
1,regular,1,"Steve Barron, who directed ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" ""Electric Dreams"" and a mess of music videos, understandably can't seem to whip up any enthusiasm for the project. Nor is he able to inspire this large, listless cast of zombies. "
0,regular,0,"In Julie and Julia, Ephron, like her heroines, has finally found what suits her: a surprising comic and romantic realism."
0,regular,0,Much of the success of the film is due to the four leads who seamlessly work the one or two outrageous moments into the story without resorting to over-the-top characterizations.
1,regular,1,"This is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video  -- with a lousy script, inept direction, pathetic acting, poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography, complete with visible boom mikes."
1,regular,1,"People do stupid things all the time. My friend and I sat through Compliance, didn't we? But there is a level of stupidity displayed by the people in this movie that beggars belief. Their behavior is to stupidity as the Death Star is to a doughnut."
0,regular,0,"Lian Lunson’s camera allows the music to take center stage via straightforward, graceful compositions—close-ups and medium shots dominate, and edits are kept to a relative minimum—that allow for long, unbroken views of the artists at forceful, mournful work. "
0,regular,0,Kalvert and Goluboff overcome predictability by developing the film's characters and atmosphere instead. The result is a turbocharged ode to the lithe bodies and swaggering souls of boys who believe they're invincible - a glorious love song of youthful self-destructiveness.
0,regular,0,"It all feels studiously artless - some people huffily insist that Bujalski’s movies aren’t movies at all - but the more you contemplate his landscapes, the more his control over their various elements is revealed. He’s the real deal: a maturing artist obsessed with how and why - and if - his generation will mature."
1,regular,1,"The dialogue is as subtle as a placard, the drama manages to be both cooked-up and dull, and the movie’s fear of brainwashed, tech-addicted millennials is so broad as to be unintentionally funny."
1,regular,1,"The result is a performance that is neither funny nor empathetic, and the romance that develops between the dentist and the junkie patient is not strong enough to support the mystery."
1,regular,1,"Wildly overproduced and filled with fussy flourishes that make even a derelict hallway look like a million bucks, Dark Water fails to rustle up either meaning or meaningful scares."
0,regular,0,"13th, available in theaters and on Netflix, is one for the cinema time capsule, a record of shame so powerful that it just might change things. Godspeed."
0,regular,0,"There are moments that are too macabre and outlandish, but Gilroy steers the movie just this side of farce, just this side of Chayefsky, and keeps it all within a realistic framework. At times watching, you might wonder how he’ll keep the story going, how he’ll top himself. But he does."
1,regular,1,"A supernatural religious thriller so awful it should result in the retroactive forfeiture of the Oscar writer, director, and producer Brian Helgeland won for co-writing ""L.A. Confidential."""
0,regular,0,"Both sharp and fleet, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street proves a satisfying screen version of Stephen Sondheim’s landmark 1979 theatrical musical."
0,regular,0,"A fitting 21st-century addition to the genre. The film's meager plotting and casual melancholy peg it as a modest indie, but these ingredients dovetail nicely with Zobel's bigger theme about the futility of the modern world."
1,regular,1,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom finds another way to grow: by making its plot much, much bulkier. In doing so, it commits the worst possible sin: It makes dinosaurs boring."
1,regular,1,"The Hangover Part III, directed by Todd Phillips from a screenplay he wrote with Craig Mazin, is a dull, lazy walkthrough that along with ""The Big Wedding"" has a claim to be the year's worst star-driven movie."
1,regular,1,"It took five men to concoct the hackneyed plot and conceive the brainless jokes that constitute Not Another Teen Movie, meaning there are five men in Los Angeles right now still trying to wash that stink off their soft, idle hands."
0,regular,0,"When a forty-four-year-old man makes a movie about his family and friends sitting around singing old tunes, you certainly don't expect an unforgettable amalgam of humor and heartbreak. But that is precisely what Terence Davies delivers."
1,regular,1,Nobody would claim it adds up to much of a comedy. It's strictly for someone looking for a goof-off.
1,regular,1,"Because it so consistently fails to meld its comic sensibilities and love stories with its generic action premise into a seamless whole, The Hitman's Bodyguard sometimes just appears to be parodying the sort of mess it ends up being."
0,regular,0,The film's greatest accomplishment is its ability to change tone at least three times without losing the audience.
1,regular,1,"It's bluntly written, poorly shot and edited, and cruel without being clever."
1,regular,1,"Arsenal is garbage. The cast includes familiar faces...but it’s still a trashy, blood-spattered, sadistic thriller with a goes-nowhere plot, overwrought dialogue and a throbbing soundtrack that’ll leave your ears ringing."
1,regular,1,"The comedy, to the extent there is any, consists mainly of Carrey's verbal asides and strained reactions to people. The script gives him very little to work with."
1,regular,1,"Not only have bothersome plot changes been made, but the entire tone of the book has been transformed from tension to tongue-in-cheek with dismal results."
1,regular,1,"Mr. Smith's latest film is about nothing less than life and death, sin and atonement, and it takes the soggy cake for multiple layers of sentimentality topped by indigestible grandiosity."
0,regular,0,"Directed with playful wit and energy, with steamy sex scenes played as much for laughs as anything else."
1,regular,1,"Turns out to be a muddled limp biscuit of a movie, a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms."
1,regular,1,The visual fireworks and catchy score just underline the extreme superficiality of the material.
0,regular,0,The Wachowski Brothers once again they prove themselves our reigning masters of murk.
0,regular,0,"This rich, emotionally complex movie finds Almodóvar venturing into trickier, more fascinating territory, even if his themes."
0,regular,0,You’ll find yourselves laughing and hating yourself for doing so because Sigurðsson doesn’t play scenes for comedy despite very obviously writing for it. This is a testament to his direction and the actors’ heightened states of borderline farce played with complete sincerity.
0,regular,0,"Sam Mendes' much-anticipated second effort after his Oscar-winning ""American Beauty"" finds him working in a very different key while displaying an even more pronounced attentiveness to tone, genre variations and artistic niceties."
1,regular,1,A valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the NBA.
0,regular,0,Allen covers it all with intelligent dialogue and unexpected moments of clever visual storytelling.
1,regular,1,A benign thriller that fails to thrill is like a wet match that fails to light: frustrating and pointless.
1,regular,1,"The actors are all completely wasted in this dumb travesty of fumbling, unfocused, oversexed numbskulls who work in the movie business. Everyone connected with Nobody Walks should have done just that-early and quickly."
1,regular,1,A potentially interesting idea deflated by the absurd proclamations of an arch screenplay and smothered under the ponderous gravity of M. Night Shyamalan's dreary direction.
1,regular,1,"Beirut has zero character as a setting, reduced to a generic backdrop of rubble and sand. It’s not a real place with a distinct culture in a time and political situation which any writer worth their salt could cull mountains of rich material from – it’s Scarymuslimabad, capital of Clicheistan."
1,regular,1,"I didn't know whether to be more offended as a moviegoer or as an American, but I do know I'd rather gargle nitroglycerine than watch this again, though given that the film looks like it were buried under a log cabin for a century, I barely saw it the first time."
1,regular,1,"Suburbicon is not only unfunny, a bad sign for a black comedy, but deep-dyed dislikable."
0,regular,0,"Grim, gruelling but beautifully shot, this is intelligent, sophisticated horror."
1,regular,1,Even those looking to catch a few Diane Lane tit shots will be so exhausted by the endless nothingness between each one that it won't be worth it.
1,regular,1,Squanders its comic capital on redundant bits about her perplexed family and secret society of fellow sex addicts.
0,regular,0,"Avengers: Infinity War is epic in a way that has been often aspired to but never fully grasped when it comes to the translation from comic book panel to the Big Screen. It’s what happens when moviemakers take their source material seriously, eschewing unnecessary melodrama even as they fully embrace the grandeur, the sheer spectacle, of it all."
1,regular,1,"It's hard to decide what rankles most: what an astonishing monument to Shadyac's self-absorption I Am is, or how flat-out bad – incompetent, even – the filmmaking is. "
0,regular,0,"A runaway hit in France last year and the country's official Oscar entry, is a well-nigh irresistible film celebrating the redemptive power of music."
0,regular,0,"Pawlikowski doesn't punish his viewers, he simply challenges them. Take the vow to dedicate your attention to Ida and you’ll be rewarded deeply."
0,regular,0,"No matter what character Don Cheadle has played in his 23-year career, he's always seemed to be holding something back...Until Talk to Me."
1,regular,1,"The cavernous emptiness of The Canyons cannot sustain itself, and it makes for a mostly flat, strained and uninvolving experience (not helped by the pace which makes 90 minutes, feels like a sluggish two hours)."
1,regular,1,"Red Heat is poorly, or even indifferently, made. It's a joyless exercise, and too much angry resignation seeps in for it to be very funny or very entertaining."
0,regular,0,"Part of the film's brilliance is its stunning and unforgiving transmission of the great truth that for most of us, death is not a single, flatline moment, but a gradual, insidious process of deterioration."
1,regular,1,"Cody Banks would probably be appropriate for the 13-and-older crowd, but it’s far too dopey for teenage sophisticates."
1,regular,1,"The clichéd and predictable Suspect Zero is the latest evidence that Hollywood has run the serial-killer thriller into the ground through overuse - the same way it earlier exhausted, say, buddy action-comedies."
1,regular,1,"Airless, senseless — and seemingly endless — this clumsy heist movie, directed by the prolific schlockmaster Brian Trenchard-Smith, manages to make even the magnificent coastline of Queensland, Australia, feel dreary."
1,regular,1,"The disgraceful script is by Duncan Kennedy, Donna Powers, and Wayne Powers. Directed with occasional flashes of nasty wit by Renny Harlin."
0,regular,0,"Pugh, a young newcomer with just a tiny handful of film credits, gives a performance of rare ferocity."
0,regular,0,"M.A.S.H., one of America's funniest bloody films, is also one of its bloodiest funny films."
0,regular,0,The house itself - which walks down the street in one impressive scene - is memorably voiced by Kathleen Turner.
1,regular,1,"Everything in Mikael Håfström's film is needlessly bloated to accommodate its status as an international, prestige production."
1,regular,1,"The question is, how did the producers get the amiable, talented Jason Lee to Boogie Board down the toilet with (Green)?"
0,regular,0,"Directing from the nonjudgmental script he wrote with Michael Armbruster, Ku's assured, unadorned documentary style allows his leads ample breathing room to inhabit their devastated characters."
1,regular,1,"This film bespeaks a truly startling mistrust of the movie audience, and, what's more, a disrespect for the feature film medium. Yes, of course it was conceived as an unpretentious entertainment pitched mainly to girls and young women. Yet that doesn't explain the nightmarish quality of the finished product."
0,regular,0,"It's the kind of movie you can settle into, secure in the expectation that you can steal from it more than a little vintage Allen fun."
0,regular,0,"The movie is rich with class tension, and if Allen nails the moods of the wealthy, he also gets surprising, dynamic performances from Hawkins, Cannavale, and Andrew Dice Clay as the folks who have no money but may have a fuller sense of what life is."
0,regular,0,Frisky fun made all the more entertaining because of the potent chemistry between its quartet of lead actors.
1,regular,1,"This floppy British romance, directed by Thea Sharrock and adapted by Jojo Moyes from her best-selling novel, sits at the point where tedium, ridiculousness and heartfelt sentiment converge, separated by an all-but-imperceptible distance."
0,regular,0,"A work of quiet, crystalline empathy, I’ll See You in My Dreams is notable for reasons that nearly overshadow its modest yet indisputable charms. It’s a drama about the kind of people invisible to the movies and much of our culture — senior citizens in the early evening of their lives — and it grants its characters individuality in ways that are almost wholly free of cliché."
0,regular,0,"After that first second we quit wondering: This is magic, after all, so who wants to know where Henson is?"
0,regular,0,"I saw more important films at Sundance 2003, but none more purely enjoyable than Bend It Like Beckham, which is just about perfect as a teenage coming-of-age comedy."
1,regular,1,"There is such a thing as an infinitely bad movie, and this is it."
0,regular,0,Cuts a path directly to the heart.
1,regular,1,It's an experience as frustrating as watching Jeff Gordon drive a stock car through a bowl of oatmeal.
1,regular,1,"If you think three months is an impossible amount of time to write and produce a feature film, well, it is."
1,regular,1,"In striving for a combination of grit and grandeur, Leterrier misses a chance to make the kind of camp classic that could have endured for generations. Instead, it's a muddled disappointment."
1,regular,1,Awful disaster movie that combined the worst elements of soap opera with special effects (bad matte paintings and the ridiculous Sensurround)--featuring an all-star cast that should have stayed home and waited for a real earthquake.
0,regular,0,"More in the tone of the big screen ""Friday Night Lights"" than ""Rudy"" or ""The Blind Side,"" it succeeds as mainstream entertainment without relying on a conventional storybook framework."
0,regular,0,"Krisha, directed by first-timer Trey Edward Shults, is a masterful opera of discomfort and hurt feelings."
1,regular,1,"If Alex Proyas' Knowing were reasonably entertaining -- instead of just dour, pointless and tedious -- it would be a camp classic."
0,regular,0,"Although respectful of its central subject, Comedian is not worshipful. Rather, it is curious about what in Seinfeld's hard-wiring allows him to maintain his equilibrium."
0,regular,0,"A wee romantic charmer, a delectable Dixie screwball romp that never loses its spry sense of discovery."
1,regular,1,"Until Timeline reaches its flaming-trebuchet-siege finale -- which should impress anyone who's never seen ""The Two Towers"" -- it has the stirring production values of an episode of the Tia Carrere action series ""Relic Hunter,"" but with only a fraction of the acting talent and intellectual heft. "
0,regular,0,"Mary Harron's movie turns out to be anything but a sensationalistic bio-picture; it neither sanctifies nor demonizes the shooter or her famous victim. What the movie accomplishes is something trickier: It treats its two principals, Solanis and Warhol, with respect and humanity."
0,regular,0,"Builds dread masterfully, but don't expect solace or ""fun."" This is not for those who like mysteries neatly resolved."
1,regular,1,"A sour, plotless and witless comedy-drama based on the final Mordecai Richler novel, wants to remind you of ""Sideways"" and its forlorn drink-moistened soul search. Giamatti is an ideal casting choice, but even this talented actor can't sell a lovable-jerk "
1,regular,1,"The Color of Time has considerable ambition, but no inner life."
1,regular,1,"There's little action in this snail-paced bore, you'll need a high-powered magnifying glass to spot the comedy and the ""buddies"" have about as much chemistry as a pair of wet socks."
1,regular,1,"Any kind of acting requires courage. Great acting requires formidable courage. Then there’s the dogged courage, spawned by devotion to duty, of wonderful actors like these, doing what they’re asked to do even though they must know that it’s no damned good."
1,regular,1,Why would anyone who wanted his or her film to be taken seriously saddle it with a cutesy title like this?
0,regular,0,"If the action in Wonder Woman comes less frequently than you might expect, it’s also thrillingly designed and staged, with a surging sense of real people, from all sorts of backgrounds, swept up in the wider conflict’s churns and jolts."
0,regular,0,"Squeezes fresh laughs out of what is, in essence, a rather startlingly post-Freudian, nature-trumps-nurture view of child development."
1,regular,1,"The problem is that director Peter Berg, aided and abetted by Smith and Theron and third banana Jason Bateman, seem to have made it literally, not realizing its out-of-whack tonalities and grotesque plot twists were meant to be played for laughs."
0,regular,0,"Last Vegas is an entertaining movie with a lot of integrity, and it gives all of its actors - all heavyweights and Oscar winners - real moments to dig in and play something. "
1,regular,1,So. What part of this is boring? All of it.
1,regular,1,"Though it boasts its fair share of shots that approximate the turtle's first-person point of view, the film's most dominant presence is its heavy-handed maker."
0,regular,0,"[Crudup] responds with a performance that's funny, heartbreaking and confidently musical, anchoring a film with a challenging and sometimes shaky premise that very much requires his steadying presence."
0,regular,0,There’s real artistry to Ferdinand.
1,regular,1,Despairingly bland.
0,regular,0,"It's the sum of things not spoken, things too painful to express, that's the heart of this quietly moving drama."
0,regular,0,"Not a lot happens, other than eating between small bits of drama and large doses of humor. If you saw the first film, you know how good that can be."
0,regular,0,Catching Fire looks and feels epic. Hands down it’s one of the most entertaining films of the year.
0,regular,0,Lots of movies about the Middle Ages can do the mud and blood -- though we sure see a lot of both here -- but in this movie it's like Refn has ripped you out of time and dropped you there.
1,regular,1,It will surely yield nominations for worst picture.
1,regular,1,"I’m in Love With a Church Girl is not unambitious: It crams into its two hours terminal illness, money laundering, a DEA sting, clubbing, a prolonged coma, and lots of Bible study. But the action – punishingly turgid, spread-it-on-a-cracker cheesy – feels inauthentic, ginned up only to promote the film’s come-to-Jesus messaging, and to call the acting amateurish does a disservice to hard-working amateurs everywhere."
0,regular,0,"The movie is not so much about romance as about goodheartedness, which is a rarer quality, and not so selfish. And Cage has a certain gentleness that brings out nice soft smiles on Fonda's face."
0,regular,0,"Nightcrawler curves and hisses its way into your head with demonic skill. When the laughs come, they stick in your throat. This is a deliciously twisted piece of work. And Gyllenhaal, coiled and ready to spring, is scarily brilliant. He truly is a monster for our time."
0,regular,0,"The Dark Half retains its power, offering proof that King and Romero are a match made in horror heaven. Or is that hell? [23 Apr 1993, p.3]"
1,regular,1,For a movie that spends so much time extolling the virtues of the imagination to show so little of its own is more than ironic - it's offensive.
0,regular,0,"The performance by Ross invests Jessie with a kind of zealous hope that is touching: Here is a slutty loser touched by the divine, and transformed."
0,regular,0,One of the year's most original and emotionally profound movies masquerades as the tiny story of a young couple who take a backpacking trip in the Caucasus Mountains the summer before their wedding.
1,regular,1,I don't remember ever wanting to just haul out and punch a movie before Gigantic.
1,regular,1,"Cheap, preposterous and mind-bendingly dreadful."
0,regular,0,"This is the kind of movie where you can anticipate the next big shock and it usually arrives right on cue, and yet it still gets you right in the gut."
1,regular,1,Distributors are clearly scraping the bottom of the barrel with this flimsy exposé of presidential adviser Karl Rove.
0,regular,0,"The film is surprisingly timely: Today's fierce, revitalized misogyny makes the 1970s male chauvinism droll and quaint in comparison."
1,regular,1,It's like an amateur theater production. Reiner rushes through the setup in such a mad dash that it feels like a cartoon.
1,regular,1,The only people who could be surprised at this movie will be those who wandered into the wrong multiplex theater by mistake.
1,regular,1,"It's more like  ""Porky's for Dummies,"" a thoroughly depressing teen farce in which Internet voyeurism has replaced human intimacy and where privacy is SO 20th century."
1,regular,1,"I'll tell you what's insane: the probability that folks will go easy on this dreck because it's aimed at younger viewers, who are being distressingly trained to expect little from their art."
0,regular,0,One of the truest films I've seen about the ebb and flow of a real relationship.
1,regular,1,"A disappointing effort from a master filmmaker, Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk trips in all the wrong places."
1,regular,1,"From the lowercase lettering of the title to the deadly familiarity of the plot, there is much to grate on your nerves in this TV Afterschool Special trying to pass as a real movie."
0,regular,0,A gently spellbinding drama that captures the old-fashioned enchantment of Roald Dahl’s book.
0,regular,0,"Many times, films that combine comedy and drama do so in an uncomfortable and unwieldy manner. In Slums of Beverly Hills, the approach is natural and satisfying."
1,regular,1,"A crackpot Looney Tune, pretentious, abysmally slow, amateurishly acted and, above all, wrong."
1,regular,1,"This, however, is not Mamet – it's a beast of roaring stupidity that devours everything in its path, including the veteran filmmaker. "
1,regular,1,Watching The Snowman keeps you so thoroughly occupied with trying to figure out why the movie itself exists that all other questions become irrelevant.
1,regular,1,"Director Harold Ramis and his cast fetch overchewed shticks, but what's surprising is the incompetent witlessness on exhibit. There's no limit to the botched comedy rhythms and wasted opportunities."
1,regular,1,"Unpleasant when it isn't dull, Apollo 18 never sells the lost-footage illusion, and never compensates for it with scares. Jolts, sure. Like so many lazy horror directors, López-Gallego knows how to startle, but not how to frighten."
0,regular,0,Romero's newest is a horror movie for hard-core fans of the gory and the gruesome and a classic genre film for genre aficionados.
0,regular,0,"An amazing work, a film that seems to gurgle up from the American heartland, resonant and fully formed, ripe with possibilities."
0,regular,0,"Executive Decision, a film as generic as its title, follows its 'subdue the terrorists' template by the numbers - but they're numbers that can work over and over, when handled as competently as they are here by director Stuart Baird. [15 Mar 1996, p.8E]"
1,regular,1,"It's difficult to not be cynical and redundant to declare this sequel needless for anyone except accountants, considering the studio involved. But this ranks among Disney's most shameless shirkings of its responsibility to creatively entertain, in order to pursue profits."
1,regular,1,The less-than-persuasive result is like mediocre leftover psychedelic '60s underground cinema.
1,regular,1,The really relevant defect of this thriller is that it isn't scary.
1,regular,1,"It's trashy and disgusting - and those are the best parts. Mostly it's just an endless, pointless drone with characters like bacteria and dialogue like an untuned radio."
1,regular,1,"The 3-D is cheesy (2.2-D at best) the gags are gross (Gulliver urinates on an 18th-century palace to extinguish a fire) and the production abandons all hope of coherence when the hero fights a climactic battle with a giant robot out of ""Transformers."""
0,regular,0,Brilliantly entertaining.
0,regular,0,The Wave builds up a nice bit of genuine tension and hits some surprisingly dark notes.
1,regular,1,"Hideously directed with all the comic subtlety of Oliver Stone on speed, A Very Brady Sequel misses almost every single mark it sets for itself, from the disastrously ill-conceived animation that marks Roy's hallucinogenic mushroom trip at the family dinner table to the persistent background hiss on the film's soundtrack. Even Sherwood Schwartz would've hated this dog."
0,regular,0,"The movie is more a collection of cool people telling great stories than it is a structured documentary (despite Camalier’s attempts in that direction). But in this case, that’s enough."
0,regular,0,"Writer-director Maoz is best known for his 2009 film “Lebanon,” based partly on his own experiences as a tank gunner during the 1982 Lebanon War. Like that film, Foxtrot brings a coolly critical, occasionally surrealist eye on the assumption that Israel’s military efforts have made for a better, wiser people."
0,regular,0,"An allegory of our times, Shotgun Stories is a tragedy of biblical scale and an intimate family drama. Unlike the more lauded films of last year, which glorified a national preoccupation with bloody deeds, Shotgun Stories is a passionate cry to end the violence and a reminder that we, as free individuals, have the power to determine our own destinies."
0,regular,0,Lee has forged a work of art in the classic sense -- art that delights and instructs.
1,regular,1,"A buddy cop movie that pretends to spoof buddy cop movies along with reality TV shows, Showtime is so lazy and artless that … that …  it saps my will to come up with a good quip: Witless in itself, it is the source of witlessness in others."
1,discrepant,0,"The tone, casting and material form a less-than-perfect match in Married Life, a period domestic drama that never quite decides if it wants to be a credible marital study, a noirish meller or a sly comedy."
1,discrepant,0,"Let's face it: Lizzie McGuire (Hilary Duff) is just too darn polished to be a junior-high underdog, even by the standards of her 'luxe suburban environs. "
1,discrepant,0,"Marguerite strives for ambiguity and settles for a muddle. It piles too much on its serving plate, and at 129 minutes it’s definitely overlong."
1,discrepant,0,"The result is a movie that can be wonderfully languid and wonderfully breakneck as well, a formula movie so gleefully bedizened with quirks that it always seems better than it is. [5 Dec. 1984, p.C1]"
1,discrepant,0,"It clearly wants to be more, but it's failed by its lightweight leads."
1,discrepant,0,So no one would argue that Thumbsucker sucks. But the thing does seem just so indie-movie familiar.
1,discrepant,0,"Instead of the heat of humanity, what lingers on in the mind is the cool of the computerized effects."
1,mixed,0,"Compared to a really great poker game, sometimes “Molly’s” comes up a little short. It definitely keeps you too long at the table. And there are times — like every Sorkin script — where it won’t stop talking. Really, buddy, shut up and deal...But when the chips are down, its stars come through. And in the end, we all walk away winners."
0,factual,0,"Challenges us to reconcile its snapshots of earnest entrepreneurs, colleagues, and fans with its long takes of her disillusionment."
0,mixed,0,Pedestrian but appealing.
0,mixed,0,"The film may have dated as a cautionary left-wing tale, yet it has stayed fresh as a study in the minutiae of power.  [1 Oct. 2012, p.85]"
0,contextual,0,There is more comedy than outrage in this critique of sexual inequality in Iran.
1,mixed,0,"If you're a football fan, chances are you won't be bored, and the distraction may be quite welcome. As for everyone else, you may lose interest right around the third quarter."
1,factual,1,"Less explored in all the ensuing back-patting is the question of whether Cameron is, in fact, sincerely interested in learning more about the world around him or whether this mission is merely intended to stroke his own ego."
0,factual,0,"Cooper's interest is in the collaboration between the talent and its managers, in the way the duo urged their charges to begin to conceive of their sound, look, marketing, and live performances as all expressive of a singular vision."

1,contextual,1,"If Marmaduke achieves anything, it's that it makes this past spring's ""Furry Vengeance"" look like a masterpiece by comparison."
0,factual,0,"When We Leave is a film without villains. Instead, it features a set of circumstances that inevitably and needlessly spin out of control."
1,mixed,1,This beautifully shot and painstakingly constructed film is a self-indulgent bucket of hogwash.
0,contextual,0,The good news is that the movie advertises Dolan's delirious visual talent.

1,regular,1,"The movie is a septic tank of vapid noir posturing, bad narration, bizarre pacing, cartoonishly hot femme fatales and ineptly staged slapstick."
1,regular,1,"An ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental. Surely, no one PLANNED something this disastrously unfunny."
1,regular,1,"Every so often there comes a movie so tasteless, so nakedly pandering, so bodaciously ill conceived that you’ve got to see it to believe it. This year, that movie is Collateral Beauty. "
1,regular,1,A shockingly inane college comedy that accomplishes the nearly impossible feat of being far worse than it looks.
1,regular,1,It's desperately lifeless.
1,regular,1,"A 23-minute movie dragged out, via some narrative gimmickry, to a punishing hour and a half."
1,regular,1,"Holmes, with Alice Cooper hair and crazy Jim Carrey eyes, looks terrible and acts worse, unless this movie is unintentionally a lobotomy documentary. Whatever could have happened to her in the last couple of years to zap the talent out of her like this?"
1,regular,1,"Implausible at every turn, it offers a dab of quirkiness and edge from writer-director Finn Taylor, but otherwise has nothing for audiences to embrace."
1,regular,1,"A cynically made, painfully long comedy without a single laugh. It's a film to really make you wonder about Damon Wayans ' abilities as a comic actor. "
1,regular,1,"Lacking the requisite post-""Scream"" irony, the film is simply a package of gougings, stabbings, drillings and guttings, all tied up with a ""twist"" ending that anyone with a still-functioning brain could figure out in a matter of minutes."
1,regular,1,What I experienced was a lot of fetid experimental-film folderol perfumed by Chopin nocturnes on the soundtrack.
1,regular,1,"The film treats its audience like fidgety junior-high schoolers, piling on the sub-Koyaanisqatsi cityscapes and cheesy episodes with Marlee Matlin as a lonely photographer, plus bouncy cartoons of human cells who look as if they'd be happier chasing stains in bathroom-cleanser commercials."
1,regular,1,"Nobody hits the jackpot here, certainly not filmmakers Michael and Mark Polish, whose audacious, empathic first film, ""Twin Falls Idaho,"" showed such promise."
1,regular,1,"Lean, nasty, and patently absurd, The Tortured plays like one long scream of agony."
1,regular,1,"Though it's allegedly a comedy, there is nothing funny about this tasteless, shallow and mean-spirited slam."
1,regular,1,It's a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone else.
1,regular,1,A flat-out cynical attempt to launch a new Lethal Weapon-like franchise.
0,discrepant,1,"A Light In Darkness isn’t as offensive as the first film—it lacks the requisite misogyny and Islamophobia, and does a better job of looking like it’s almost a real movie—but it’s not far behind, an emblematic film for the foul moment."
1,contextual,1,A movie that keeps jumping the gate and finally unravels all over the floor.
1,mixed,1,"I'm genuinely of two minds about the picture. I want to say it's subtle, but I also want to say it's heavy-handed. I want to say it's incisive, but I have too many problems with its psychological elisions to let it off the hook."
1,mixed,1,"Though Fiennes has done (far) better work, the blurry story seems almost profound when seen through his eyes. To the extent the movie works at all, it works best when it's just the camera and Fiennes in a bleak white room."
1,mixed,1,Pleasant but dull formula film.
0,mixed,1,"Geostorm is terrible entertainment, but it’s a remarkably effective window into Donald Trump’s soul."
1,contextual,1,Disheveled tripe pieced together with the good intentions.
1,contextual,1,Dumbed down to the point where it's barely recognizable as coming from one of Donald Westlake's John Dortmunder novels.
1,contextual,1,"No one doesn’t love Bill Murray, but his melancholy torpor can wear thin in the best of circumstances, and these circumstances are pretty close to the worst. The cast includes Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson, Danny McBride and Scott Caan. No one escapes unscathed."
1,contextual,1,"If someone ran this guy through a scanner, the readout would say: “Mark down and stock in straight-to-video aisle."""
1,contextual,1,"The film is a bedroom farce without the farce, a fish-out-of-water comedy on sun-cracked lake-bed, a story of fatherly redemption that barely gets past the hair-mussing stage."
1,contextual,1,"The 'roo doesn't talk, except in a dream sequence…I'm dying here."
1,contextual,1,This one veers further from actual horror into an action picture. “The Purge” tries to unsettle. The Purge: Anarchy wants you to cheer.
1,undefined,1,"Hobo hits the screen as a grim, visually ugly, intermittently funny-occasionally preachy piece with only the estimable Mr. Hauer to recommend it."
1,undefined,1,"Liebesman hews close to the 2003 pic’s bile-tinged snuff-film aesthetic. His approach falls somewhere between the overwrought sadism of the “Saw” series and the giddy gore-for-gore’s-sake energy of “The Devil’s Rejects,” sharing those films’ twisted notion that today’s auds are willing to embrace such homicidal maniacs as heroes."
1,undefined,1,Doremus captures each insipid moment with hand-held camera urgency and clumsy jump cuts.
1,undefined,1,"Don't expect style or invention, much less satire. Its only interest as an experiment is that, out of duty, the roomful of critics I saw it with all stuck around until the end."
